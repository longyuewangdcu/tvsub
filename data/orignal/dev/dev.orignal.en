Okay, this is it.
You sure you wanna do this?
Hello, Mrs. Ross. Woo-hoo!
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel.
My God.
Come on, Pheebs, hurry! Hurry, hurry, hurry.Okay! Okay!
My God! Is everybody getting married?
No running in the chapel.
Don't you give me any of your Hey!
Hi. Hey!
What are you guys doing here?
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married!
Isn't that why you guys are here to find them? Yes.Well that-yes.
Why else would we be here? 
What happened? Did we miss it?
We actually missed it.
Well, maybe you wouldn't have had you run in the chapel!
This is insane.
What's the big deal? It's not like it's a real marriage.
What?
If you marry in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.
Really?
Yeah.
my God.
Oh, well.
Why are we in bed together?I don't know.
Do you have any clothes on?
Yes.
Really? No.
But we didn't have 
sex, did we?
I don't remember much about last night.
It was such a blur.
I remember laughing. I laughed a lot.
Then we didn't have sex.
I mean, we were really drunk.
I'm glad we didn't do anything stupid.
Tell me about it.
Morning, Pheebs. 
My movie has been officially canceled.
I'm so sorry.You want some of my breakfast?
No, I'm too depressed to eat.
I'll probably eat in, like, five minutes.
So I guess I'll fly home with you guys. What time is your flight?
What about my cab? I don't need it anymore.
You borrowed my cab,you have to drive it back.
I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely.
How about if you come with me?
I don't know, it's a long trip. That would be great.
We could talk and play games.
This could be our chance to, like, renew our friendship.
Are you asking me to have a "frienaissance"?
Sure?
All right, although I don't think we need one. Baby.I never stopped loving you.
Hey. Hey.
So has anybody talked to Dr. And Mrs. Geller yet?
They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
Where is the waitress? I'm starving.
It's a buffet.
Here's where I win all my money back!
I gotta talk to you.
Sure. What's up?
Monica and I almost got married last night
My God! That's huge!
Wait a minute. Why wasn't I invited?
And who was gonna be your best man? 
Don't say Ross. Do not say Ross.
I just don't think we are ready to get married yet! You know? I mean, I love her and everything
but seeing they coming out of that chape
It was like a, like a wake-up call that we are moving so fast.
How do I tell her without crushing her heart?
You tell her she's not marriage material.
What?
Girls say it to me all the time.
And believe me if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon.
It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
You don't. Yes, I do.
Good. I was just testing you.
Hey. Oh, hi.
We were just talking about bacon.
No, we were talking about tennis.Tennis is more believable.
Hey.Hey.
Hi.  Thank you.
Coffee.
What? Are we gonna talk  about what you guys did last night?
What do you mean "last night"? Nothing, uh, happened last night.
Ross invited us all to watch.
Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
Who got married?
You did?
What?
We didn't get married. No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!
I remember being in a chapel.
They would not let us get married when we were that drunk.
They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
I'm drunk right now.
I can't have a mimosa with breakfast? I'm on vacation.
What are you guys gonna do?
I guess we find a divorce lawyer.
I think Ross already has one.
This one's free, right?
Because you paid for the first two, third one free.
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you 
because we don't need to get divorced. We're just gonna get an annulment. An annulment?
Ross, I don't think surgery can help you.
that's your thing!
What?
Your thing, you're the guy who gets divorced.
Oh, yeah.
that's not "my thing."
I do not love getting divorced.
Yes, you do. This is your third divorce.
You love divorce so much, you're probably gonna marry it 
and then it won't work out, so you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy.
I'm so drunk.
So, what do you think we should do? - I don't know.
I know I love you.I know I love you.
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
That's a good question.
Last night we let the dice decide.
We should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
We don't get married unless there's a sign.
Okay? So say,
You roll another eight, then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
All right. Eight we get married  but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, we don't get married.
Sounds great. Okay.
We got a shooter.
Money, please.
Ready? Ready.
Come on, eight.
Yes, eight.
Eight, easy eight.
Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.That was so unlikely.
- Well, let us get married. I guess.
That wasn't hard eight. Last night I rolled a hard eight.
That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damn it!
I wanted it so bad!
- Wanna go pack? - Yeah.
- We're doing the right thing, right?
of course we are!  We left it up to fate.
If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.
Come on. You can't win if you don't ask any questions!
What? You promised me a fun road trip.
We've been on the road for 6 hours, and you've been asleep for 5 and a half.
We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back!
That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper.
All right.
And until then, you are going to sing to me.
Because the radio's broken, and you are selfish, but you have a nice voice.
Really? Sing!
This is a long drive.
Are my eyes open?
No!
Morning.
Hey, hubby.
I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing.
I'm not gonna do that.
Okay.
So we'll just stay married.
Yes, exactly.
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller.
This is so amazing.
I, uh, really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
Now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
I'm not kidding.
Look, I
I can't have three failed marriages.I can't, okay?
I am not gonna be that guy.
So, we just stay married forever?
Okay, how?
How is this going to affect you, really?
I mean, you fill some form out once in a while 
instead of checking the box "Miss," you check the box that says, "Mrs."
It's right next to it.
Okay, I'm sorry. You're right. We absolutely can stay married,
because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other.
All right.
please take a moment here 
and think about what you're asking of me.
I am asking you to do me a favor.
You are asking me to be your wife.
And, as my wife, I think you should grant me this favor.
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
Well, you did pull his hair.
He took my snack. I'm not getting into this again.
All right. Hurts really bad.
I told you not to walk. Here.
There. There. Okay.
This doesn't mean anything, does it? No.
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?
He could be a rapist or a killer or something.
Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?
I'm not talking to you. You go back to sleep.
Are you a rapist? No.
Do you like car games?
Yeah, you know the, uh, license plate game?
I love the license plate game!
I'll play. I'll play.
No, you need your sleep. Night-night. Shh.
Hey. Hey.
Listen. I know you wanted to talk to me 
but I have an idea that may make you wanna stay married.
We register
and you get to keep all the presents.
No, Ross. Listen to me.
I've thought about how to tell you this
the bottom line is we cannot stay married.
I don't know if that's true.  Oh, but it is.
You know what this is?
This is a difference of opinion.
When that happens in a marriage. Ross!
This is not a marriage! This is the world's worst hangover!
If you do not get this annulment, I will.
All right. I'll do it.
Thank you.
is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
There's the train station, where I get off.
I have your address and phone number.
And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter.
So ball's pretty much in your court.
All right. See you.
Come on, I can't take this any more. Please talk to me.
Let me make it up to you, huh?
Stop it!
That's not fair. You know I can't resist that beautiful voice.
Pheebs, I am so sorry.
I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver.
Now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship.
So I will strive to stay awake for as long as I know you.
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Thank you.
So can we play 20 Questions now?
I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
Okay.
Is it 
a kind of hot sandwich?
Yes.
Is it a meatball sub?
That is incredible!
You are the master!
Bug!
That's funny. You look like you're
Don't say it!Don't even think it.
All right.
Chandler, enjoy your handful.
Should we just get married?
All the signs are telling us to do it.
I'm sick of the signs.
It's too fast. I'm happy the way things are. Me too.
I don't want change, do you? No.
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! 
And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
Relax, it's not like we're marry.
I was thinking, what if I 
unpack here?
All your stuff would be here.
Well 
What if all my stuff was here?
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time.
Doesn't make any sense.
What if we live together, and you understand what I'm saying?
Live together?
There've been no signs for that.
Me asking is kind of a sign.
Yes! Yes!
Yes.
Okay. Wait.
Okay. Here's your key.
You have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
Door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay.
Ready? - Ready!
A little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
Wait. My God, I can't get out!
This isn't a sign! No, it's a very old key!
It's an old key! My God, it's old.
I love you.
I love you.
Are you hugging the door right now?
No.
Yeah, me neither.
Hey.
So did everything go all right with the annulment?
No problems. It's all taken care of.
Ross, thank you.
Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie? Why not?
Pheebs? No thanks, I've already seen one.
I'm gonna get my sweater. Okay.
You wanna hear something weird?
Always.
I didn't get the annulment.
What? We're still married.
Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
What are you doing?
Key is stuck in the lock.I can fix it. Hold on.
Watch out, watch out.
It still doesn't work.
I'm not finished. Oh.
Nice job. You are quite the craftsman.
-Don't answer it.  -I have to. It's football season.
Oh, come on. There is no game tonight.
-Paulie, what's up?  -Forget that.
-I was making cheese dogs for you.  -Why, what's going on?
Okay.
All right.
I'll be there.
Chrissy!
It was a bitch getting off work.
-Adriana, I think this could be it.  -What?
He told me to meet him at Modell's. He told me to shine my shoes.
Oh, my God. Christopher!
Find a matching shirt and tie for me. Not the camellia. Paulie has one.
I can't believe it. I mean, I knew it would happen, but...
So now can we get out of here? Get a big loft, maybe?
-You're giving notice today.  -You wish.
The wife of a made guy doesn't hostess.
I'm so proud of you.
-I love you, Christopher.  -You better.
-What?  -I don't know.
You getting called like this and going off all happy. I worry, that's all.
You've seen too many movies.
-How you doing, kid?  -Good.
No, no, no. Ride up front.
Where we going?
You look good. Shoot your cuffs.
Where we going, Sil?
Here he is.
So this is it.
All right.
He sat on one ass cheek the whole way over!
-Too many movies, is his problem.  -I didn't sit funny.
All right. Let us get started. Come on.
All right, finish up over there.
You know why we're here.
So if you've got any doubts or reservations, say so.
No one will think any less of you.
Because once you enter this family, there's no getting out.
This family comes before everything else. Everything.
Before your wife, your children, your mother and your father.
It's a thing of honor.
If something happens and you can't earn...
...we'll take care of you. That's part of it.
If you got a problem, you just gotta let somebody know.
This man right here, he's like your father.
No matter if it's with somebody here or outside...
...you bring it to him, he'll solve it.
You stay within the family.
All right, give me your hand.
Okay.
That's St. Peter, my family saint. As the card burns...
...so may your soul, if you betray your friends in the family.
Now rub your hands together like this and repeat after me.
-May I burn in hell...  -May I burn in hell...
-...if I betray my friends.  -...if I betray my friends.
Congratulations.
-My heart's pounding.  -You done good with the sports book.
-Yeah, it's been good.  -I'm gonna give it to you. It's yours.
-I was wondering what it was gonna be.  -You're a made guy now.
It's your turn to make real money, and I get to relax.
Your only problem is to give me 10 points of the take each settle-up day.
Other than that, you got no problem.
My only problem in life? I gotta kick my points to that man over there.
And onward goes this thing of ours.
When you think of all the headaches people have...
...ours are boiled down to one. Not a bad deal.
-You got it.  -There's a six-G minimum every week.
I gotta get something out of this. Six grand could be a lot or a little.
Depends on you, and how much you grow the business.
I love you, Paulie. We're in it together now.
I love you too, kid.
Anything on the Newark Riverfront Esplanade project?
My guy says the matching funds are close.
They added plans for a Newark Museum of Science and Trucking.
More cement. More everything.
Answer the fucking thing.
So you feeling okay?
You mean about my mother? Well, what're you gonna do?
-You pick up the pieces and go on.  -I meant your spells.
They're not spells.
How do you know about that?
Everyone knows. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
-Julius Caesar was an epileptic.  -I'm not epileptic.
Whatever it is, take care of yourself. It's your health.
-Is the psychiatrist helping?  -You know about that?
There's no stigmata these days.
My kid saw one for that thing with his wife.
-They're happy now.  -What about privacy?
Our family's done business a long time with the Sopranos.
Peacefully and profitably. I wanna keep it like that. Take care of this.
-All right, Carmine.  -Be a better friend to yourself.
I will. I appreciate your concern. Really.
Jayne was determined to "bust" into the business, so to speak.
Hollywood folklore has it that she called Paramount Pictures and said:
"My name's Jayne Mansfield and I wanna be a movie star."
You got a phone call from some young kid.
Drew. He asked when you were going home.
How'd he sound?
Like he was about 15 years old.
Wait. Is that your so-called fianc?
 -He's 19, and he can go all night.
When are you going back to Seattle, Janice?
It depends on how long it takes to settle Ma's estate.
Estate? A falling-down house and some old-lady underwear.
-Sad, isn't it? What it all comes to.  -You know how much we love you.
And you know we love having you around.
But there's a big house over there. And I know you want maximum value.
So for security, or so it don't fall into disrepair, you could stay there.
I been thinking the same. I just don't wanna push Svetlana out.
I talked to her. She's moving out tomorrow, maybe the next day.
-Really?  -Yeah.
Great.
I better go pack.
Jesus Christ! Let me come around.
How you doing, Roy?
Congratulations.
Large Old Blue Eyes for this gentleman. Soft drinks of choice.
Look.
-Without Tony, he's a zero with shoes.  -He wears a stripe.
-My uncle Richie was gonna...  -Yeah, but he never did.
-Chris. My propers.  -Dino.
Hey, Benny.
Congratulations.
-When did you get out, Benny?  -D.A. tossed it. Witness bailed.
- Jackie, how's Rutgers?  -Fuck it. I'm dropping out.
Come on. "Boola Boola."
We were talking about our former school. They got the coffeehouse.
It's a pure cash operation. The beauty part is...
...I mean, who's gonna stop you? Kids? Campus security?
What are you telling him about that? That's ours.
- Watch where the fuck you're going!  -Kiss my ass!
Take it outside! Don't disrespect the pizza parlor.
- Asshole! I know where you live!  -You hear what I said?
Good talking to you, Chris. Keep Dino in mind.
I'm not to be an asshole, but I can't be seen in a place like this anymore.
All right.
This has gotta start showing results, or end.
I talked to a business associate about these panic attacks.
Enough fucking around. Enough money in your pocket.
What's the story here?
The latest treatment of Panic Attack Syndrome is a three-part approach.
It's a syndrome?
Medication for depression, psychotherapy...
...and cognitive behavioral therapy.
You're on medication.
If you feel ready, you could see a behaviorist.
- You mean talk to somebody else?  -You seem unhappy with my approach.
If you're really ready to commit to mental health, I say great.
Let us get going, I'm ready to help.
But we'll have to delve deeper. Focus.
This latest incident, for our starters.
All right. Fine.
My daughter brought home a black.
They were on the couch, watching TV. They are snuggling.
And?
She went upstairs, and I had a frank conversation with Buckwheat.
I told him to stay the fuck away from my daughter.
And she came downstairs and they left.
Then you had the attack?
Not right then. I went to the kitchen for a sandwich, I opened the cabinet...
...I saw a box of Uncle Ben's rice. Boom!
I see. It's the rice logo.
The first onset of hyperventilation, that occurred upon you seeing the rice?
No. I was taking the capocollo and shit out of the fridge.
I'm thinking when you first came here, the panic attacks with ducks...
...as I remember it, you were grilling meat, weren't you?
The memory on you.
- Sausages, wasn't it?  -Sausages. Steaks. Yeah.
Wow. Let us get back to that capocollo.
I gotta take that. It's my busy season.
Yeah?
Fifty?
That's pretty rich for one game.
If he's good for it, take it.
But keep me posted on Duke-Wake Forest.
All right.
Sorry.
Where were we?
The connection between your anxiety attacks and meat.
Right.
What was it again?
Closing Ohio State. They're kicking off.
- Who you like? lowa?  -They are no difference, as long as it pays.
Chris, fuck. Oregon vs. USC?
I told you we should have laid off some of that action.
Spread's 11.
Oregon's down by 12, they're on the 45, no timeouts.
Oregon's got an All-American field-goal kicker.
Why didn't somebody tell me?
- See?  -And it's good!
Forty-three yarder.
That spread could've opened at 18, fucking top 10 team!
We should have laid off some. Paulie did it all the time.
You see him here?
What's the matter with you people? Answer the fucking phones!
- Minor setback, that's all.  -Oh, yeah?
- The frost is on the pumpkin.  -Supposed to warm up.
It's good football weather.
Mom said she's waiting for the meat you roasted.
- Did Jackie Jr. show?  -I don't know.
- Little fuck promised he'd be here.  -Watch your mouth in front of my kid.
Probably keeping a booth warm at the O.F., him and Dino Zerilli.
What's he doing? I told his father I'd try to keep him out of this.
- He's the heir apparent.  -He is not this kid.
Do me a favor. Watch out for Jackie, okay?
You ought to turn that one link there.
Little setback, huh?
Ro, your kid's late. It's rude, he should be set straight.
He'll be here. I paged him. The poor kid lost his dad.
I lost mine when I was 6.
Ralph had to drop out of 11 th grade to raise his siblings.
You'd never know it.
I'm Satan to this kid, just because I'm in love with his mom.
- What are we talking about?  -The cheerleaders. Any hotties?
There's no cheerleaders for freshman ball.
These are Mario Batali's string beans, with Parmesan.
- You are very late, young man.  -It's me.
- Meadow! Hi, babe.  -Who is it?
- It's Meadow. What are you doing?  -Nothing. What's going on?
- Well, Sunday dinner.  -Yeah?
- Do you wanna talk to your dad? He's outside.  -Burning a cross?
I don't know what you mean, but it's not the proper time.
- Your brother wants to talk to you.  -No, I don't.
- Hello?  -Hi. What's up?
- Everybody's here. It's boring.  -Is that Jackie?
It's not him. It's Meadow, from school.
Hold on, call waiting. Hello?
- My mother there?  -Yeah.
Aunt Ro? Yeah, I gotta go.
Thank you.
- Where are you?  -I can't make it.
- We're all waiting. You promised.  -Fuck it.
The way he talks to me...
I'll bring it up to Tony, maybe he'll talk to him.
Paulie?
What time is it?
That's almost all of it.
Warren probably told you about Oregon-USC.
This is unacceptable.
It's $4000. I'll have the rest in a few days.
-I thought I made myself clear.
Fucking college ball. But I learned a valuable lesson.
I'm not running a school, kid.
Paulie, this is me. You know I'm good for it.
Don't drag in our friendship. You work for me.
- I want to...  -Shut up and listen.
I'll give you a few days...
...but it'll cost another your two G's as a reminder not to fuck it up.
I make myself clear?
And don't give me the malocchio. I'm not the one with the short bag.
Any word from your lvy Leaguer? How's Carm with the empty nest?
Empty? Meadow's always home with laundry or hauling food out.
She didn't go far.
We created too nice a home life. They don't want to go.
But if they're closer to us than
 we were to our parents, is that bad?
- What time is it?  -I'm here, aren't I?
- Out of respect to my father.  -I gotta make two phone call.
Sit down.
- Do you want something to eat?  -I'm not hungry.
That's too bad. I said lunch meeting.
You want a drink?
Lose the glasses.
I'm gonna say a few things.
I'm gonna say some bad words, and you're gonna have to deal with it.
I know what you think. You think I clipped your uncle.
You'd be a shithead to believe I didn't do it.
But I didn't.
And I got some bad news for you. Look at me.
Look at me.
- Your uncle was a rat.  -No fucking way!
Sit down. Sit the fuck down.
He was a rat. He's in the Witness Protection Program.
- That's my father's brother.  -I'm a member of your family, almost.
You think I'm the only one that knows this about Richie?
You ask anybody. This hurt all of us.
Jesus Christ.
Your dad and me, you know how close we were?
He never wanted this for you. He wanted you to be a doctor.
Give me a fucking break.
Let me tell you something. Besides the money, doctor's a powerful position.
I'm no doctor.
Know how hard you have to work to get your MD? How many years?
I was thinking osteopathy, but I don't have the grades for that.
You're not gonna drop out of Rutgers?
No. But those premed courses almost killed me.
I only did it because my dad was sick.
But you should know he never wanted this life for you.
And I'll tell you something. I don't want it for my son, either.
Come on! Let us go, I wanna see you hit them! Get off the ball!
Fourth and three and this cetriolo is going for it? With that offense?
Why's my kid still on the bench?
The coach will let him in. They all get to play one quarter.
Pucillo in for Sposato!
Pucillo played already! Put my kid in!
It's the rules.
I told you they wouldn't make it.
Are you fucking crazy, ref? What?
What did you say? Come here and say it!
- Romano. The periodontist.  -Get off the field!
I'll rip your heart out!
- Look. Anthony's going in.  -All right, A.J.!
Okay, defense, 41 stack.
- A.J.! Stick them, baby!  -Stick them! Do it!
- Fumble!  -Fumble!
Up! Up! Everybody up! Wait, get up.
It's A.J.! Yeah! Yeah! Good job, A.J.!
Good job, good job. Yeah!
Hey! Hey!
That's my son.
You got a nose for the ball, and that can't be taught.
But you gotta have leverage and footwork.
I remember hitting that sled till my shoulder was raw.
But then you reward yourself.
So I'll take you to Stewart's and buy some dogs.
I just wanna go home.
You should be riding high after what you did on the field.
Do you wanna play some Nintendo? You and me?
When are you gonna toss that out the window?
- Why?  -Well, all right. Let us play Nintendo.
Okay, let us go to Stewart's.
- Yeah?  -Yeah.
- Yeah?  -I need you home, Tony, for dinner.
- Now? It's our busiest season.  -I know.
It's important that we not turn into a family who eats at the counter.
All right. I'll be there.
Pass the potatoes to me, please.
Anthony? The potatoes?
- Sorry.  -Every night.
Go ahead. Pour yourself another glass.
You need good bones for those open field tackles.
So. How was everybody's day today?
Busy.
Nana was asking me where you might want to go to college.
- I don't know.  -West Point.
- West Point?  -That's what you said.
- No, I didn't.  -Oh, yeah, you did.
- You said Harvard or West Point. -I'd never say that. I'd never get in.
- Can we eat with the TV on?  -No.
I gotta take that. My busy season.
Mom there?
Hey, how are you?
Is Mom there?
- Yeah, she's here. How's school?  -Fine.
Is Mom there?
- Is that Meadow? Can I talk?  -Yeah, you can have her.
Hello?
Did you hear what happened to Bobby Capodianco?
I feel bad. Taking your old room.
Don't worry about it. You're all settled in.
You could sleep in your mother's room.
- Pass.  -Won't be for long.
Bill's children go to live with their mother, end of week. I stay with him.
A few days is not a problem. I'm glad I can help you out.
God knows my brother used to sleep like a dead man in there.
I'm sorry about how I behaved at the cemetery.
Janice. I cannot give records back.
I wish you'd reconsider.
I know Livia left no will, but possession is 9/10 of law.
Let us not descend into that.
Feeling in me is, she is not here to ask.
I know. I'm sorry. This is an emotional issue for me.
I thought that if we could talk one-on-one...
...I could make you understand how much those records mean to me.
Just promise me you'll sleep on it.
It was that fucking bird in the window!
It was a coincidence.
I was making good jack! Now everything turns to shit?
The bird thing is if it's in the house. And that's death, not bad luck.
- Will your mother loan me money?  -She's paying for her hysterectomy.
- Where's that bracelet I got you?  -Get rid of that stupid Range Rover!
I'm sorry.
Jesus-fucking-Christ.
Janice! Janice! Janice!
Janice! Janice!
The fuck is this? You owe me $300!
-I ain't using. Chris, I got mugged...
That's it! I want my money!
Fuck!
- Janice call yet?  -No.
Hello, Tony.
- How have you been?  -What is she doing here?
She brings me old leg. Piece of shit, made in Russia.
I have losted weight, cannot wear it no more.
Only an hour, then starts to hurt.
- I'm getting married. Did you know?  -You told me.
- Wish you all the best.  -She put into my Sprite three Halcyon.
I miss you so much, Tony.
Let us stick to the subject. Your cousin's missing a leg.
$20,000. That's what it cost, leg she took.
Flex foot, latest technology with vertical shock pylon.
Plus, calfskin boot.
Kenneth Cole.
You don't even want to talk to me. I don't see why we can't be friends.
I don't even know what I'm doing here, except you worked it this way.
- We could have talked on the phone.  -I'm sorry, Tony.
It's not your fault.
Look, I'm sorry about your leg.
I'll reach Janice.
- Janice put any food in there?  -No, but I have orange juice.
Plus there are two Miller Genuines.
And your mother's meat delivery still is coming every week.
Southern California vs. Notre Dame.
We're in Indiana on a perfect football afternoon.
- See you next week.  -Thank you.
- I was just gonna call you, Johnny.  -Oh, yeah?
- Someplace we can talk in private?  -I'm kind of busy.
Gonna call.
Now you're busy.
- Something I could get you, Junior?  -No, I'm good.
It'll just take a minute.
Anthony, I told you to wait in the car!
Listen to your old man, Anthony.
So, what were you gonna call me about?
I don't got it.
Weasely son of a bitch!
Can't you make payments? See me. Work out a plan.
- I swear, a vendor owes me $300.  -Shut the fuck up!
Your wife's weekly order's ready. It's gotta be $30 worth of meat there.
Capocollo, chops and a standing roast.
You gonna backtalk me? Junior, get him over here.
No, wait, please! What are you gonna do?
Anthony, what did I fucking tell you?
What, your father never cut off anybody's pinky?
That's traumatic
for anyone to witness, much less an 11  -year-old.
Actually, it wasn't.
It was a rush, if you want to know the truth.
- You want me to delve?  -Go on.
Dinner's ready.
Come here.
Come on, I wanna talk to you.
What you seen today, Anthony, a very sad thing.
You disobeyed your old man, and I ought to give you the belt.
But I gotta say that...
...a lot of boys your age would have run
like a girl. But you stayed.
I know you like Mr. Satriale. We all do. He's a lovely man.
The man is a gambler.
He got over his head in debt. He owed me money and refused to pay.
He avoided me.
That's why you should never gamble, Anthony.
What was I supposed to do?
That's my livelihood. It's how I put food on the table.
You should never gamble, Anthony.
Johnny, dinner's ready! Anthony! Janice, turn that off.
Let this be a lesson to you.
A man honors his debts.
Beautiful cut he sent.
You like it standing with the bone in, Lee?
Look at those juices.
Go, Wayne Newton.
Can I have the end piece?
Johnny, let us eat while it's still hot.
You bet, baby. The lady loves her meat.
Four stitches. Ruined dinner.
- This was your first panic attack?  -Fainted, my old man called it.
Obviously, we've finally touched on something here.
What you witnessed that day. Where the meat came from.
And your mother's great pleasure in it.
It was the one time she'd be in a good mood...
...when the weekly delivery from Satriale's came.
Or Fusco, the vegetable man, maybe.
Probably the only time the old man got laid.
- Probably.  -Pretty sick, huh?
Getting turned on by free cold cuts?
Did your mother question why the meat was free?
Meat that was going into her children's mouths?
I don't know. I don't wanna know.
I don't wanna think about any of it.
I'm sure it was too much for you then too. That's why you short-circuited.
You are in your puberty. Witnessing not only your mother and father's sexuality...
...but also the violence and blood so closely connected...
...to the food you were about to eat.
And also, the thought that someday...
...you might be called upon to bring home the bacon.
-Like your father.  -All this from a slice of capocollo?
Kind of like Proust's madeleines.
- What?  -Marcel Proust.
He wrote a seven-volume classic, Remembrance of Things Past.
He took a bite of a madeleine.
It's a kind of tea cookie he used to have as a child.
And that one bite unleashed a tide of memories of his childhood...
...and ultimately of his entire life.
This sounds very gay. I hope you're not saying that.
No.
Understanding root causes makes you less vulnerable to future episodes.
My fucking head is swimming here.
We're gonna have to stop. It's a lot to process.
But we've made real progress today. Good work.
And I'd really like you to write down any thoughts or associations.
See the left tackle?
He fakes inside, and then gets a spin move on the guy.
Now he's charging the quarterback. See?
- I thought the tailback had it.  -You gotta keep your eye on the ball.
- Okay, I'm going.  -Where?
I gotta bring Med her biking shoes, she's been missing my braciole.
- Can I come?  -Hey, we're watching the game.
I can catch the game in the car.
It's nice he wants to visit his sister.
- You're right. I'll get my shoes.  -Why not watch your game?
What, I shouldn't go now?
A.J., why don't you bring this stuff out to the car?
This is about Sambo, right? I'm paying for that goddamn college.
I don't know what's going on. But if you want to make a scene...
...then comb your hair and come along. Embarrass her.
Alienate her. Or better yet, cut her off.
Let her drop out and go to a state school. Or move back in here.
I was just trying to protect her. And I'll do that till I die.
I'm not gonna tell you you can't come. She's your daughter.
I'll probably watch the game.
Garcia handing off at the 40-yard line across to the 43.
Garcia handing off at the 40-yard line across to the 43.
Leave me the fuck alone.
Go for the touchdown. I need another five points to cover the spread.
Hi. Pardon me.
Here she is. Come on. Meadow!
We're here.
- This is my mom and my brother, A.J.  -Hey.
- Dad didn't come?  -No, he didn't. Did you want him to?
- Noah, would you mind?  -Noah told me what Dad said.
- It's out in the open, so fuck this.  -Let us watch the latrine-lip.
Oh, what'd Dad say?
Anthony, wait for me downstairs. I want to talk to your sister.
- Oh, I know what he said.  -Go.
I'm always being sent away. Why do I bother going anywhere?
- What did your father say?  -Like he didn't tell you.
- Believe what you like...  -He called Noah things so ugly...
...I can't even repeat it.
- You're right. There's no excuse.  -He's lucky I didn't punch him out.
- Because you're civilized.  -So this was gonna be a big drama?
You wanted your father to subject your friend to this again?
Wait. So I'm in the wrong?
The rest of the world should work around...
...his racist, retrograde, fucking-asshole personality?
He's from a place and a time where he thinks it's in your best interest.
New Jersey? The third millennium?
Noah, you know what I mean.
You are coming from a racially-mixed marriage and you must have been a burden.
Don't slam his background. Look what you wound up in!
Excuse us, Noah. I want a word with my daughter.
I'm not going anywhere unless she wants me to.
It's okay. I'll be up in a little while.
I'd hate to think you're airing family business in public.
Noah's not stupid. It took him a while, but he caught on.
He keeps his opinions to himself.
Unlike some people, he's brilliant and sensitive.
I'll keep my mouth shut.
Anything I say to you, or your father, will just fuel this.
I'm not gonna stop seeing Noah.
I put your helmet there. Though I'd rather you not bike in the city.
If you must know, I'm going to Litchfield, Connecticut...
...to the weekend home of Noah's parents' friends, who work at NBC.
but Hegel is talking about...
- Svetlana, get out here!  -Oh, hi.
You must be the famous Bill. Moving day, huh?
I didn't think you would have the nerve to show your face to me.
- Why? What's wrong?  -Don't bullshit me. Where is my leg?
- Your leg? Oh, yeah, where's your...?  -I know you took it.
That's preposterous. How could I use it?
You think that will make me give records back, but you're wrong.
If you see a karmic connection between my mother's records and your missing leg, wow!
The records return, and so does the leg. I see how you got there.
How do you live with yourself?
Bill, don't waste breath.
This cunt is gonna be sorry she ever fuck with me.
You better hope you have all your shit, 'cause I'm calling the locksmith.
Doc. Where's Dino?
They got him for possession. What do you care?
He mentioned a job at Rutgers. A coffeehouse.
Coffeehouse, shit. We were gonna jack a benefit concert there tonight.
- Can you make it work without Dino?  -It was my fucking idea.
I know this must be hard, Anthony.
Your sister off at college, you all by yourself with us.
But it won't be for long.
Soon, you'll be heading off to college yourself.
- I don't think I'm gonna go.  -College? Of course you will.
I don't wanna talk about it right now.
There's so many people, all smarter than me. A bunch of freaks.
What?
You're not excused!
- You're punished!  -He's all right. Lascia lui.
Move this car and your life will not be worth shit.
Get me Jewel's autograph.
You're a good kid. I'll bring you her underpants.
- All goes in there, no one gets shot.  -Oh, my God!
- You're robbing a benefit concert.  -Is that all there is?
- Most people used student cards.  -Hey! What's going on?
Say one word on that fucking thing and you're dead!
Hit it!
There's your money.
- You ought to hit a tanning salon.  -I had a late night.
Give that shit a rest.
Man needs his seven hours to keep sharp.
This was work. Little Jackie hyped us to a score at Rutgers, not bad.
What's the matter, Chrissy? Tell Uncle Paulie.
Being made isn't like I thought. A lot of responsibilities.
- What did you think?  -You're as smart as the week's lines.
One mistake and you're chasing, not making, money.
Welcome to the NFL, rookie. Go home, get some sleep.
Tomorrow's a new day.
Sorry I'm late. I had to make a few stops.
- Have a smelt.  -No.
We had a very good week this week, boss.
- How's our little friend doing?  -He had some knocks.
Came out all right.
Wait'll he hears the policy on newly-made guys.
They're subject to strip search for wires.
He'll love that.
He had to augment his kick with a stickup little Jackie put him onto.
Jackie Aprile?
- He did the thing in the papers?  -He was only the wheel man.
I told Christopher to leave him out.
 -I'm just telling you what I know.
Don't be too hard on him. He's having a hard enough time.
What's wrong with him? When's he gonna grow up?
- Where's Soprano?  -Here.
Guys, take a good look at Soprano and remember his performance last week.
He's on the sidelines three quarters, waiting. Does his mind go soft?
No. Does his fire go out? Heck, no.
When the call came, he brought his A game.
He may have a big future. He may be a leader.
That's what it takes. And that's why I'm naming him defensive captain.
All right! So let us hit those showers, one thought in mind...
Soprano! Soprano, you all right?
