How many telephones are there?
Two.
And that's the only exit?
Yes.
And there's no contraband in your apartment.
That's correct.
Any firearms?
Nope.
Any other weapons of any kind?
Well, knives. Do they count?
Can I see them, please?
No, that's fine.
And which room would your husband inhabit?
So, if the judge approves electronic monitoring,
I'll need a small space by the front door for the receiver.
Do you have Wi-Fi?
Yes.
I'll have to test it to make sure there's no interference.
Now... I have to ask your children some questions,
if you don't mind.
What kind of questions?
Eh, nothing invasive.
Same questions I asked you.
Please.
Zach, Grace.
Yeah?
Do either of you have contraband in your rooms?
No.
Any firearms?
No.
Any other weapons?
No.
Great. That should do it.
Excuse me, sheriff.
Hi, Alicia, it's Diane.
We need you right away.
Now?
Yes, I'm sorry, it's very important.
And can you bring a few things?
Toiletries, clothing for 48 hours, and a man's tie.
Sonya, I'm so sorry.
What is it about?
I don't know.
I'll call you as soon as I find out.
Will you be all right?
Oh, yes, we'll be fine.
Mrs. Kelzick is downstairs...
A phone call away.
Is Peter really coming home?
I don't know.
They do this to prepare.
We'll see.
So, does your face turn into, like, a cow's head or something?
You never did mushrooms in the peace corps?
Hey, I was with the good kids.
So when is something supposed to happen?
About an hour.
No. No...
Cary, I know you were supposed to have tomorrow off,
but we need you in now.
Um... what?
*Cary's high on mushrooms.*
Why, what...? Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, okay.
Collecting the troops.
Put everything on hold for 48 hours, okay?
*Cary's high on mushrooms.*
You there?
I just got here.
What do you know?
Diane's with the wife now.
How bad does it look?
Bad.
See what you can do, okay?
Hey, Kalinda, what you doing here?
I just got a deposition get canceled.
I saw your lights.
What's up?
Homicide in the suburbs.
Better than Cirque du Soleil.
Who is it?
Female, no ID, looks about 20.
Security guard says it's the babysitter.
What is it, burglary gone wrong?
Come on, it's making me nostalgic.
I got a police scanner at home to keep me company.
Hey, K, what's up?
Hi, Tony.
Just wanted to see the professionals at work.
Civilians aren't welcome.
What?
Come on, Lou, she's a friendly.
She scratches our back, we scratch hers.
All right, I've got the security guard in here.
The kids were fine; she took them to their grandparents.
I said that she should wait for you guys here,
that you'd want to talk to her and Mr. Rucker.
Mr. Rucker was with her?
No, it was just her.
I don't see the babysitter's car.
Who picks her up and drops her off?
Mr. Rucker.
Husband?
Yeah.
He's like a stay-at-home dad, right?
Yeah... yes, sir.
He just lost his job. He's out of work.
Do you know where Mr. Rucker is now?
At the movies.
We get a babysitter on Thursday evenings
So my husband can take the night off.
Otherwise he's home all day.
Have you been in touch with Jason yet?
No, no. I-I mean, I've been trying his cell.
Okay.
Could you write down his number?
You don't think they'll think Jason...?
We have to prepare for everything.
Hi, you've reached Jason Rucker.
Please leave a message.
Mr. Rucker, this is Will Gardner.
I'm a partner at the law firm that represents your wife's company.
When you get this message, would you give me a call?
It's extremely important.
Struggle here...
Here.
Blood spray. Crenellated.
More struggle, more defensive spray.
Handprint on the wall.
What's this?
Looks like the rubber nub from under a computer.
Just a guess.
Oh, boy.
Is that the babysitter?
Yes.
Lisa Pruitt.
I-I found...
She was in my bathroom.
I'm sorry to ask this, Sonya,
But our investigator on the scene is saying
there was marijuana.
Did Jason smoke pot?
No.
In college.
Why?
Sorry, you're...?
You get that a lot?
Less so.
Sorry, I'm a news junkie.
Your husband... I heard he's getting out.
Oh, I don't know.
It changes day to day.
I hope he does.
Thank you.
Which floor?
Oh, you just pressed it.
Oh, you work at Stern, Lockhart.
Maybe you know what this is all about.
Something about my wife's company?
Sorry. Junior associate... I'm the last to know.
If there's anything, you just...
Jason.
What's wrong?
What happened?
Mr. Rucker, do you have a second?
It's not a knife.
Those aren't deep enough for knife wounds.
Looks like a blunt instrument.
Maybe it's something from the bedroom.
Check the fireplace poker downstairs.
It's missing.
But I just saw her.
You just saw her... the babysitter...
when you picked her up?
Yes.
I picked her up at her dorm,
and I drove her to...
I'm in trouble?
I'm the last one that saw her.
They'll suspect me?
Yes.
Oh, my god.
Then why...?
I need to go to the police, don't I?
I just spoke to them.
I agreed to surrender you in the morning.
But these first few hours of an investigation
are always the most important.
Anything can be misinterpreted.
Won't my coming here be misinterpreted?
Unfortunately, it's a risk we're going to have to take.
This early in an investigation,
it's all about leverage,
and you have the right to remain silent,
so our leverage is
how much access we allow the police.
They want more, we want less,
so we're the gatekeepers to you.
Yep.
We're going to have you take a polygraph, Mr. Rucker.
It's not about truth or innocence.
I'm sorry, a lie detector test?
Yes, I need information
so I know how much to let you talk versus how much to keep you silent.
Yeah?
They're on their way to you now.
They're not going to wait till tomorrow.
How long?
20 minutes, ten if they send someone from central.
You have 15 minutes.
I'm going to start hooking you up.
Here you go.
Thank you.
In about five minutes
the police are going to burst through those doors.
I need you to be on for the next 48 hours.
That's how long they have to charge him with murder or release him.
It's now going to be the most crucial 48 hours of his life.
If they charge him, bail's a long shot
and he could spend a year in prison before he comes to trial.
Even if he's found innocent,
that's a year of his life gone,
So these 48 hours are gonna be like a mini-trial.
We're gonna get the cops to look somewhere else
and get him released, okay?
I rode up in the elevator with him.
Either he's the best actor in the world
or he had no idea this happened.
Okay, good, it'd be nice if he was innocent.
It's a better hand.
Come on, I thought we had an agreement.
Jason Rucker.
Yes?
Mr. Rucker, you are under arrest for the murder of Lisa Pruitt.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Easy, easy.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford an attorney, Jason! Jason!
one will be appointed...
Sonya!
Ma'am, no, you need to step back.
Okay, here we go... 48 hours.
The panic alarm was triggered from inside?
Yeah... yes, ma'am.
So the alarm wasn't triggered from someone breaking in.
It was triggered from someone already in?
Yeah, that's why they're thinking the husband did it...
Because he could disarm the system.
And who else can disarm the system?
Who else,
uh, besides Mr. Rucker?
Yes, Mr. Horner.
Well, uh, housekeeper and Lisa, the babysitter.
Miss Pruitt?
Yeah.
What?
You said "Lisa."
Yeah, Lisa Pruitt. Why?
What's the housekeeper's name?
I don't know.
But you know Lisa's.
I try to be observant.
Hmm, selectively observant.
You can also disarm the alarm system.
It's not just the housekeeper and Lisa the babysitter, is it?
I don't think I want to answer any more of your questions.
You don't need to answer any more of her questions.
So... did you find the murder weapon?
The poker?
Yeah, it's right outside the door,
Right where the husband dropped it.
The husband?
Yeah.
Really? And how does that play, Tony?
He lets himself in,
tries to rape her, she resists, he kills her.
Steals the missing red purse,
triggers the alarm on the way out,
make it look like a burglary.
See, I'm liking the security guard.
Oh, you're such an unbiased observer.
Guard sees the babysitter,
wants her, lets himself in, disarms the code,
tries to rape her, she resists,
then steals her pretty red purse,
triggers the alarm on the way out
to make it look like a burglary.
Husband lost his job as a cartoonist two months ago.
Now he's sitting at home playing Mr. Mom
While wife's out making an internet fortune.
That hubby needs to reassert his manhood.
Hey, listen, I'm all for dime store psychoanalysis
if it helps me close a case.
Just keep an open mind for the security guard.
My mind is as open as a field of poppies.
You look, um... content.
You know, sometimes the fog dissipates,
the rain disappears, and everything makes sense.
Uh-huh. You've made a decision?
I have.
Alicia around?
Uh, no.
Peter.
Glenn.
So, you know the offer you made?
What offer would that be?
Freedom today if I don't fight the conviction,
stay disbarred, can't run again.
Yes, that offer. Smart move would be to take it.
So I have to imagine you're going to tell me to go to hell.
You want the longer version?
Can't wait.
I wouldn't get too comfortable in that office of yours.
I'm gonna testify.
Would it help if I told you that that's a mistake?
Look, if I end up in a 12 by 12 cell
for the next nine years,
I just want to know that I did everything I could.
Will you call Alicia for me?
I liked her.
I wouldn't hurt her.
So, you were at the movies?
Yes.
Legend of condor hero. It's a wuxia movie.
A...?
Wuxia?
Wire fu.
Chinese flying.
Oh, like crouching tiger?
Sorry.
They play them every thursday night
at Armour square, chinatown.
And you have the ticket stub?
No, I threw it away.
You...?
Okay, so we're gonna have to find someone who saw you there.
Wuxia, wuxia.
Cary, can I talk to you for a second?
Are you on something?
No.
I like you, Alicia.
I like you, too, Cary.
I need you to pull it together now.
Okay.
Okay, here we go. Pulling.
What I don't understand is why are we hearing about this now?
I showed you his lie detector test.
A partial test you conducted.
By a top FBI polygraphist,
and he was passing with flying colors.
Then let me question him.
With conditions.
I could charge him right now.
Then do it.
What's stopping you?
You don't have enough.
I want two of my lawyers to stay with him at all times.
They have the freedom to consult him with the camera off.
And I want 15-minute breaks every hour.
No food?
Pizza.
In one hour.
He is a little creepy.
Walks around like he's saving the neighborhood.
You know what?
We had a break-in right after he started six months ago.
Really? What did they take?
That's the thing.
Just some money from our bureau,
some clothes from my closet and popsicles.
Popsicles?
Yeah.
I think he did it,
just so he could come and take a report, you know?
Same thing with three other houses in the neighborhood.
It's just creepy.
Then what did you do?
Well, I dropped her at the house.
I made sure she had my cell number,
then I went to the movies.
Did you see the security guard anywhere near the house?
The guard? Sure. He's always around.
You seen him around much when you dropped off Lisa Pruitt?
I guess.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Gardner.
We're following all leads.
Really?
Yes.
Because I know you have an unoccupied interrogation room.
So, very simply,
you're in jail now because you DP'd cases, is that right?
It is.
Could you explain?
Well, dp means declining to prosecute.
And what cases did you decline to prosecute?
Uh, investigations into allegedly corrupt real estate practices.
What was happening is
that speculators were buying depressed properties
on the land near where olympic stadiums were to be built.
Why did you stop these investigations?
They sound promising.
For a very simple reason-- Lashkar-eTaiba,
which is a Jihadist extremist group
believed to be active in Chicago,
allegedly involved in last year's attacks in Mumbai.
And the fact of the matter is,
is I pulled these investigators from these other cases
because I believed that the pursuit of these extremists was more important.
In fact, there was an arrest in October?
That's correct.
That would be David Coleman Headley,
allegedly a key member of LeT.
So...
Why didn't you testify to all of this at your trial?
I should have.
But there was a larger consideration.
A failing in my personal life was being used against me.
I wanted to protect my family against further hurt.
I knew that I couldn't testify about these false corruption charges
unless I was then willing to testify about...
my life.
Thank you, Mr. Florrick.
Mr. Landry, your witness.
Actually, my witness, your honor.
Um, your honor? Objection.
On what grounds?
Mr. Childs, you're not the judge here.
Apologies, your honor.
Uh, Mr. Childs is instrumental in the matters
directly under consideration here, your honor.
Those are the grounds.
But Mr. Florrick is such a great American hero...
Your honor.
...and has been instrumental in the defense of our great nation.
Your honor!
Surely he wouldn't mind a few softball questions.
My goodness,
the sarcasm is as thick as butter here today.
I don't mind being questioned by Mr. Childs, your honor.
In fact, I welcome it.
Well, then, let's take a short break for lunch,
and pick up right where we left off.
She was selling drugs.
I bet it was a drug deal gone bad.
Come on, you don't know that.
I knew her better than you did.
Look, I think it was that guy from the neighborhood where she babysat.
She always said he was a nuisance.
Excuse me, but do you guys have a minute?
Yeah.
Sorry. I have to go to class.
All right. Hey, I'll see you after comp, okay?
So, are you a cop?
Nope. Homicide.
Would you mind, please?
What you were saying about Lisa Pruitt's babysitting--
she ever mention anything to you about a guard?
No. No. A secure...?
No.
It was the dad that she was working for.
Um, what's his name?
Burkle, or, uh, Rucker.
She said that he was getting too close.
Making her uncomfortable.
They were working on something together, some project,
And she said she was gonna quit.
So,
Um, do you want me to make a statement or something?
...we'll call you, okay?
All right.
Yeah.
Look, um, not right now,
but maybe you and I could meet up later,
and I could take it down then.
So, you threw away your ticket stub. Is that it?
Yes.
Okay.
And this chinese movie-- what was it about?
Legend of the condor heroes?
It's about two sons learning martial arts in mongolia.
Sounds exciting.
You know chinese?
Chinese? No.
Then how did you understand it?
The subtitles.
That's odd.
We checked,
and there were no subtitles on the print last night.
Usually there are subtitles, but...
not on that one.
Let's take a break for a second.
Yes.
Let's do that, Mr. Gardner.
Detective?
The camera.
What's going on?
It has nothing to do with this.
Mr. Rucker, you don't understand. The decisions you make right now
you'll regret for decades if you don't make them right.
Yeah.
Look, I just...
you don't know what it's like to be out of work, to be stuck at home.
I do. So tell me.
I have a place to work, to do...
I do graphic novels.
But... but just on spec. I'm not being paid.
And you do this work at an office?
That's where you were?
You weren't at the movies?
It's just a studio to draw.
It's nothing. It's the size of a closet.
And Lisa Pruitt was working with you?
Our investigator is talking to a friend of Pruitt's.
She did some writing for your graphic novel?
Yes.
Were you sleeping with her?
No.
So, what's in the studio?
What's in there that the police might misunderstand?
I don't know.
Has she been there?
Has Lisa been there?
Yes. Once.
Look, I didn't say anything
'cause I knew how it would look.
So, where is this?
Where is this studio?
What do you have?
Looks like your client had a little love nest.
Just found out about it on the victim's computer.
You know the security guard had priors for selling dope?
Dope?
Yeah. And a hero complex.
That's fascinating. Keep on that.
There are three unexplained burglaries in the last six months.
All on the same nights the security guard worked.
Damn. I just sent Alicia off to check it out.
She's got about ten minutes.
Okay. Calling.
Alicia, where are you?
I'm, uh... looking for the key.
Didn't he say it was on a pipe?
Yes, and, not to put too much pressure on you,
but the police are on their way.
On their way here?
Yes. They're about ten minutes behind you.
Now,it's not a crime scene, so you're fine to inspect
and take anything you want.
Anything I want? What are we saying?
I have the key.
Look...
Look, I don't know what you're going to find in there,
but until the police declare it a crime scene,
you can preserve for our uses anything you find.
Has Jason said anything?
No, but the police could misunderstand something they find.
And Kalinda thinks the security guard is heating up.
Here's something she wrote.
A short story.
Okay, I think we could use that.
There's a blonde hair in a brush.
What do I do?
Is it a long hair?
Yes.
Take it.
No hair in the drain.
Thanks. Good.
There's a bra on the towel rack.
One second.
They're here.
Thanks.
You all right?
I think so.
You were well within the law.
"well"?
You were within the law.
I know it feels like we're playing a game sometimes,
but we're not here to pursue the truth.
We're here to defend a client.
And if he's guilty?
Then, he's guilty.
Truth is above our pay grade.
Who's with Jason now?
Cary.
Take a few hours off.
Get some lunch or something.
Are you going to go back to help Cary?
Yes.
Go.
Get this off your mind.
She telling her?
Yep.
That can't be a fun conversation.
Why do you not look surprised?
You knew he had a studio?
No, but...
Every marriage runs on a few secrets, Diane.
Men need their caves.
Did you know he was working with her on writing a graphic novel?
No.
I knew something.
It's been hard for him since he's been out of work--
for me to be the one earning the money.
So, did you ever think that he and Lisa...?
Why do I suddenly feel as though I'm under suspicion?
Sonya, the question is going to be asked.
If there's something that you want to tell me,
now is a good time.
No.
Well, then...
Is he innocent?
of?
Hurting her?
Yes. Yes, he's innocent of that.
But sleeping with her--
He's not innocent of sleeping with her?
I don't know.
Is there-- Sonya, I-I hate to do this,
but Jason isn't being up-front with us--
Is there anything that would lead the police
to believe that he is guilty?
There might be.
Let's start with the easier questions, shall we?
How many times did you sleep with this prostitute,
Amber Madison?
Objection, your honor.
Sex is not relevant to my client's guilt.
Mr. Florrick was sentenced
for dp'ing cases in trade for sexual favors,
So sex is entirely relevant to his guilt, your honor.
The fact of the sex is relevant, your honor, but not the minutia.
Then I will endeavor to discern the minutia.
You may continue, Mr. Childs, but, oh, so carefully.
How many times did you sleep with Amber Madison?
Well, just to be precise, Mr. Childs,
by "sleeping with," you mean "having sex"?
Yes. Thank you.
And just to be even more precise,
by "having sex," I will also include oral-genital contact.
18 times.
18 times.
And would you classify any of these as oral-genital contact?
Objection.
Minutia, Mr. Childs.
Thank you, your honor.
Now, were these assignations with Amber Madison...
Were they in hotel rooms?
Yes.
All 18 of them, you were in a hotel room?
To the best of my memory.
Well, let's see if we can refresh your memory.
Did you ever sleep with Amber Madison
at your home while your wife was away?
Objection.
Your honor, the defendant has made it very clear
he believed he paid for these various hotel sessions with Amber Madison.
We just want to be clear
that these were the only sessions.
Overruled.
So, Mr. Florrick,
Did you ever sleep with Amber Madison at your home,
in your bed, while your wife was away?
No.
And you know you're under oath?
Cammy, let it be stated that I know I'm under oath,
and I know that Mr. Childs is trying to catch me in a perjury trap,
and yes, my answer is still no.
Thank you, Mr. Florrick.
No problem.
She set up a nanny cam in the living room
to see if her husband was sleeping with the babysitter.
Well, would've been helpful to know.
Yes. More secrets than an O'Neill play here.
It's in a digital clock on the end table.
I'm not sure I'm going to be able to get in.
Do you want me to tell the police?
No. I don't know what's on it.
Sonya says there's a key under the mat by the front door.
Right. Let me see what I can do.
Oh. Does she have a laptop case with her?
Yes. Why?
When you get a chance, check and see if one of the rubber nubs
on the bottom is missing.
Any particular reason?
The police think it was used to knock out the babysitter.
Miss Sharma?
Process server.
You've just been subpoenaed.
Which case?
Florrick's appeal.
Have fun.
I'm not testifying.
Then you're going to jail.
Look, I've got nothing to offer.
You have everything to offer.
You know you do.
Peter Florrick lied on the witness stand.
Tell the truth, he spends the next nine years in prison.
Glenn.
What?
Don't do this.
Come on, Kalinda. What do you care?
You're out for yourself.
You've always been out for yourself.
And either way, you're going to tell the truth.
You don't know that.
I know that the sun is coming up tomorrow,
and that you are going to tell the truth on the stand
and Florrick is going back to prison.
End of story.
You okay?
Yeah.
What time is it?
Midnight.
How long have I been here?
Day and a half.
I was freaking out.
Yes, I know.
Did you tell Will?
What, that you were freaking out?
No. Why?
It was a friend of mine from the Peace Corps.
I thought I had the day off.
Cary, I didn't tell him.
Why didn't you?
With the contest, you know, why-why didn't you tell him?
I...
There are so many people lined up against us,
I just don't want one more.
I don't want you to lose.
I know.
I don't want you to lose, either.
I kind of like you.
I'm surprised, but I kind of like you, too.
Ah, I can't help it, you know. Being competitive-- it's just me.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Not the scorpion and the frog story, please.
The scorpion on the frog's back.
Yeah, I hate that story, too.
Why do people tell it so much?
Because it excuses people's behavior.
How's he doing?
You don't want to know.
Try me.
What?
So, you were at the office all night
until you got a call from security about the silent alarm?
Yes. Why?
You didn't go home before that?
No. why would I?
Our investigator checked the nanny cam.
It hadn't been turned on.
Oh, well, I must have forgotten that day.
Yes.
We thought only four people
Could disarm the security alarm--
Jason, your housekeeper,
The babysitter and the security guard--
But we forgot, you could, too.
Yes.
Why? What's wrong?
We found a notice of a failure to deliver a package to your house.
Our investigator checked with the company.
You signed for a delivery.
At 7:30 p.m.,
when you said you were at work.
I-I didn't do it.
Okay, so what were you doing at home?
I was jealous.
I thought Jason was sleeping with her.
I came home to surprise them.
And?
He wasn't there.
She was there,
reading to the girls.
I left embarrassed, intent on never being jealous again.
And that was it?
That was it.
Can I check your laptop?
Why?
Please.
Tired?
Tired doesn't even begin to describe it.
Okay, so here's what we need to do.
Build a chinese wall.
Yep, and you can't tell me what she said.
Complete separation.
You represent Jason.
I represent her.
Each has a strong motive, and in about 12 hours,
one of them is going to be charged.
So, we can't talk to each other anymore.
Understood.
Good luck.
You, too.
One of us is going to come out the winner tonight.
I've been subpoenaed.
To what?
Your husband's trial.
Why would they subpoena you?
I know certain things.
Well, that doesn't sound good.
Are you going to tell me?
Do you want to know?
I don't know.
Oh, god, I don't know anymore.
The truth seemed so simple--
Lying, not lying.
Do you want him out?
I just want things to stop spinning.
You're right, I don't want to know.
Stay away from court tomorrow.
Alicia Florrick.
Oh, yes, thank you for getting back to me.
So, Lisa Pruitt would...
I see.
Right.
Well, thank you.
What?
That was this lawyer.
I found it near the belongings of the victim in Rucker's studio.
Lot of lawyers running around this one.
I don't even know who we're defending anymore.
It's gotten very confusing.
Yeah.
The lawyer wouldn't tell me if Lisa Pruitt had been in to see her.
Of course not. That would be too easy.
But she did tell me what kind of work they do.
Matching pregnant women with families who want to adopt.
Detective, I need you to stop interrogating my client and step out.
I was just asking a question.
You can finish later.
Please.
What's wrong?
You got her pregnant.
She was at your little studio...
No. What? No.
She went to a law firm for adoption.
Tell me now because they're going to find this out
during an autopsy.
You got her pregnant.
No, I couldn't have.
She was at your studio.
Yes, I know, but I didn't get her pregnant.
Tell me the truth.
I couldn't have gotten her pregnant.
I had a vasectomy.
I was wondering when you were coming back for that statement.
Yeah, I'm sorry I'm so late.
A couple more questions came up about Lisa Pruitt.
She ever mention anything to you about being pregnant?
Who said that?
Oh, her lawyer.
She was contacting a law firm
About putting a baby up for adoption.
Yeah, she told me.
She say who the father is?
Who she babysits for-- Rucker.
Really?
Yeah.
That's why I think he did it.
Killed her.
He wanted her to have an abortion, she said no.
Did she tell you that?
Yeah.
He, uh, he didn't want to be pinned down.
You know, this is... this is all very helpful.
You want me to say the same thing to the cops?
Yeah.
Can you come with me now?
Yeah.
Just-just give me a minute.
Sure.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Miss Sharma,
The defendant fired you from the state's attorney office, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
Now, in your own words,
could you explain why he did that?
He said I was working two jobs.
And were you?
Yes.
So you were working for him, and you were working for...?
You.
And what kind of work were you doing for me?
I was running down bimbo eruptions.
Would you please explain that colloquialism?
Your honor, again, we object to this line of questioning.
Your honor, this is our last witness.
We ask for some leniency.
Granted.
Overruled, Mr. Golden.
What were bimbo eruptions?
You were worried that lawyers and judges were being co-opted
by powerful forces who used prostitutes to blackmail.
And when you started this task force,
you discovered that Mr. Florrick was involved with Amber Madison.
Would you please explain
how she was used to co-opt Mr. Florrick?
A procurer assigned specific prostitutes
to flatter and pursue certain clients.
And the clients were referred to by number.
For example, one of the clients was referred to as client 12.
And what did these... these women do?
These-these prostitutes?
They would discover the marital status
and sexual predilections of these clients.
To use the example of client 12,
um, he was found to be a judge,
a married judge, with three daughters,
and he was deemed to be interested in African-American prostitutes,
and the imagery of southern plantation life.
Okay.
Once Mr. Florrick was involved with Amber Madison,
no money exchanged hands, isn't that correct?
Yes, that is correct.
And if a client tried to pay,
a procurer would refund the client's money.
Like when client 12 tried to pay
for an evening out with two African-American women,
that money was refunded.
Miss Sharma, you don't need to refer to a particular client.
Just answer my question.
But I've been asked to answer in my own words.
These are my own words.
Right, your words could be a bit more on point.
Now, did Mr. Florrick have sexual relations
with Amber Madison at his home?
To answer that question, I need to talk about my job,
and how important it was for me
to know the names of all the clients,
including client 12.
Kalinda.
I'm here under subpoena, Mr. Childs.
If I'm asked to name the names of the clients, I must.
Right?
Um, your honor,
Uh, again, we object to this, uh, sexual line of questioning.
It's-it's irrelevant,
just like the names of these clients is irrelevant.
We respectfully submit
that this is beneath the dignity of this court.
I would tend to agree, Mr. Golden.
Surely, your honor, there is a way to elicit this testimony,
possibly in chambers?
Not without these clients' names
becoming part of, uh, public record.
Isn't that right, Miss Sharma?
Yes, I'm afraid so.
I've given too much leeway to this sexual testimony,
Mr. state's attorney. Now I must call it to a halt.
Your honor...
No, sir.
It is 4:00 p.m.
And I find myself unpersuaded by your arguments
of Mr. Florrick's guilt.
I believe this was nothing more than a sexual witch hunt.
But that's not for me to decide.
My job is merely to determine if there is enough for a new trial,
And I believe, Mr. Florrick, there is.
I'm sorry, Mr. Florrick.
I'm sorry this has happened to you.
And I'm sorry i don't have the power to do more than order a new trial.
But that is exactly what I'm going to do.
You, Mr. Florrick, have been granted a retrial.
Yes!
The kid from the dorm was right about the motive.
It was just his motive,
not Jason's.
She wouldn't get an abortion?
They argued, and he killed her.
How did Lisa's bra get in Jason's studio?
Jason gave her the keys,
and her and Max would go there when he wasn't around.
At least that's what Jason said.
They don't look so happy, do they?
I don't understand marriage.
It's a mysterious institution.
You never wanted it?
Is that a proposal?
Yes.
I've been watching you from afar.
This is weird.
Maybe you should watch TV.
There's nothing on.
We could play 20 questions.
Does he have a key?
He'll knock.
So, it'll be electronic monitoring?
He'll have to stay here in the apartment?
Yes.
And we will all have to adapt.
Okay, maybe we should just get on with...
Here we go.
I love you both.
