We're doctors.
we are trained to take care of human beings.
And we pretty sure we know what to look for.
No, it doesn't make any sense.
I mean, everybody wants kids, and you're the people.
You wear roller skates for shoes. I don't get it.
You know what? I don't know.
Maybe there's something wrong with me.
'Cause it's not natural. It's not womanly.
Maybe I'm cold and heartless and dead inside.
No, I'm not saying that!
Well, yeah. But a little bit, you are.
No. No.
Cuts...
Infection...
Genetic mutation.
You know what? Just...
Just humor me for one minute, okay?
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
Now picture a baby.
A warm...
Smushy little... baby...
Wrapping its chubby little arms around your neck
and breathe in that...
That intoxicating baby smell.
Doesn't it just melt you?
Nope.
You know what melts me?
Spain, the beach,
you in a bikini, me holding a sangria.
Oh, wait. What's that I hear?
Oh... Oh, the baby's crying. We can't go to Spain.
A sangria? That's why I don't get a kid?
So I can make you a friggin' sangria?
Just a minute. Just a minute!
What?
Yang, you got a suture kit?
Uh, yeah.
Where's Robbins?
Uh, in there.
Robbins!
What's going on?
Wait, two. I need two suture kits!
Why is he screaming?
Baby. Now!
Why are you...
Oh, God. He's serious.
Holy mother...
Get my bag. Get my bag.
Get me a clamp.
Oh, God.
All right. Another clamp.
Clamp.
Scissors.
How is he? Is he okay? Is he good?
He's great. You did great.
Oh, dad.
All right.
Any sounds?
Not yet.
Okay.
Come on, baby boy. Come on.
Come on, baby boy. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Okay. That's my boy. Okay.
That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about.
Here you go, grandpa.
谁是罪人
Hey. So is it true, you helped Teddy and Mark
deliver little Sloan's baby?
Yeah. Not now.
What's wrong with you?
Tom Evans... in with your husband.
That's Tom Evans?
He seems a lot younger than I would've...
please try and be cool.
Morning.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. He's in with Shepherd.
Who?
Tom Evans.
Tom Evans is... is here?
You didn't know?
He's doing his bloodless CABG on a beating heart
today in our O.R. What, Shepherd didn't tell you?
No, no, he...
Bless you. Bless you.
Excuse me. No, he didn't.
An Evans bypass.
Clear your schedule. Scrub in.
Uh, no, I... I, uh, I can't. I... I gotta go.
And here she is.
Your cruise director... Dr. Yang.
Dr. Evans. Hi.
Hi.
Hello. Hi. Hi. I... I'm... Cristina Yang.
I... I'm a huge fan.
She's a groupie,
but you're gonna forgive her,
because she's one of the finest cardio resident's
you'll meet anywhere.
Quite a recommendation. Are you scrubbing in with me today?
Yes. It's an honor and a privilege. Uh, I...
here are the patient charts and, uh, the most recent labs.
If there's anything else you need, just ask me,
'cause I'll be around here all day, following you.
Um, if... if that's okay with you.
Uh... she is a groupie. I like her.
This is my wife, Dr. Meredith Grey.
Pleasure to meet you.
Likewise. I hear great things.
Of course, I hear them from your husband,
so grain of salt.
Dr. Yang?
Yes.
All yours.
Oh, yes, of course.
The patient is right this way,sir.
Think she's gonna drool on him?
I think she is.
Oh, okay. I gotta go. I'll see you soon.
Is that Thomas Evans from Baylor?
Yes, but don't get too excited. He's only here for one case.
Oh, are you sure? Because I overheard
Chief Shepherd discussing the fact
that Dr. Altman doesn't have a permanent contract.
So it would actually be a really genius move on the chief's part
to go in and seize that opportunity to...
Oh, here we go again.
What?
Shut up.
She thinks your husband walks on water.
I don't.
I don't. I, um...
No, I'm... I mean, it's... it's a professional thing.
It's, um... it's a mentor thing.
He's... he's just my mentor because he's...
he's married... to you.
And you guys are... are so great and,
um, together... together as a married couple,
and you... you... you are so great.
I, um, I do... I do think that your husband is brilliant,
but I'm... I'm sure that you think that, too, so...
That's right.
Okay. That, um...
Thank you.
You can see it, right?
The... the resemblance?
It's a newborn.
It resembles other newborns.
Okay. All right. Fine.
But you want incontrovertible proof?
Here we go.
Look at that.
Well, it's impressive. I'll give you that.
Well, I mean... I mean, a lot of that swelling is from the birth.
It will go down.
He's a Sloan.
Right. He's a Sloan.
What is it?
Trauma choppers.
Nice.
Hey, could you... could you hand me my...
Oh, well, okay. Good morning.
Good morning.
Yes, it is. I have a trauma chopper 15 minutes out
and a small window of time
where I can actually practice medicine.
Right. Plus Thomas Evans is here.
He is. He's doing a coronary...
Is he interviewing for my job?
Because I've been waiting to hear about
a permanent contract from you, and I haven't.
And Thomas Evans is here...
Teddy, temporary contract. You said you were looking elsewhere.
Yeah, I... I was, but I stopped.
I didn't know that.
Oh, I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Look, I'd be happy to consider you for the permanent position.
Consider me? For... for my job?
I had to run a search.
I can't get caught without a head of cardio.
Okay. Well, I... I... I'd like to be considered.
I'll throw you in the mix.
Hey, the baby's sleeping.
Thank you for...
everything.
I'm happy to help.
Dad.
Everything's fine. The baby's doing great.
Hey, can you grab my bag?
Oh, yeah.
What is all that?
You...
Did you buy all this for the baby?
Yeah. I figured he was gonna need stuff,
and I was already in the store.
I mean,I know it's lame.
All the girl's stuff was way better.
But boys like army crap,right?
Oh,no. Well,that's a choking hazard.
And,well,he's a little young for that.
And... and that.
He's just a little young.
Well,whatever. It doesn't really matter anyway.
He's gonna be getting a lot nicer stuff soon.
Here. Uh,this is the number
for the people that are gonna adopt him... Trish and Keith.
Can you call 'em?
Mark...
Yeah.
Do you want me to handle that call?
No,no. I'll take care of it.
It was a fishing boat accident and two patients...
one with a head lac and abdominal pain,
the other,they said something
about a fish hook being stuck somewhere.
Why would they send a chopper for a guy with a fish hook?
Uh,I'm pretty sure they said fish hook,Chief Shepherd.
Okay.
"I'm pretty sure they said fish hook,Chief Shepherd.
But if I'm wrong,you can spank me."
Shut up.
"Oh,Chief Shepherd,I do hope I'm wrong."
What do we got?
Uh,I've got the son... head laceration and crush injuries.
The dad's right behind. Let's go.
Okay.
50-year-old male,penetrating trauma to the chest.
Hypotensive in the field,gotten 2 liters of L.R. En route.
Big hook!
Big hook!
Mrs. Smitte,when is the last time you took a flight of stairs
instead of an elevator?
Oh,God,it's...
it's been years.
This time next week,you're gonna do it.
And your grandkids,you have... you have grandkids?
Two.
They're not gonna know what hit 'em.
They won't be able to keep up with you.
You mean it?
I mean it.
He means it.
Excuse me. Sorry.
Oh,hey. Come in,come in,come in.
No.
Why?
Okay,hold it steady. Grey,get in there.
What do we have?
Oh,my God.
Here we go.
Fishing boat accident.
Something fell on him.
And the hook?
Looks like he fell on it.
Pressure's at 68 systolic.
Tracheal deviation
and absent breath sounds. Get me a 14-gauge needle.
Right behind you.
Dad.
What are you doing to him?
Grey,get him outta here.
I'm trying. Doug,please.
Go on,son. I'm all right. Oh,God.
What is that? What the hell is that?
Dad,I... I don't know what happened.
I had the rope in my hand one minute,and...
Doug,Doug,come on.
No,I did this. I... I'm sorry. Dad,I'm so sorry.
It's... it's okay. It's not your fault.
Of course it's his fault!
I was thrown on top of this shark hook
because he let go of the rope.
Who the hell's fault is it?
Let's leave the hook in until we get him up to the O.R.
I'm feeling a depressed skull fracture.
All right. Go ahead and order a head C.T.
Right away,Chief.
That was the first thing he taught me when I joined the crew.
I don't know how...
We didn't play ball when I was little.
We tied knots. I know how to tie that knot.
Doug,you made a mistake. It was an accident.
What if it wasn't?
I've thought about it sometimes...
Hitting him... or hurting him.
He pisses me off sometimes and he's harsh and...
Are you telling us you did this on purpose?
No,not on purpose. I just...
I don't... I don't feel so good.
Okay,just try to relax. Deep breaths.
Deep breaths.
Okay,uh,Grey,order a head C. T. And get a C.T. Angio.
I think I saw,uh,some fluid around his spleen.
I'll do it.
Uh,I think there's some...
And I'll just deal with the vomit.
So,um,the nurse says I'm being discharged?
I have to leave tomorrow?
I just had the baby,like,today.
Well,that's a good thing. It means you're doing great.
No complications.
Right,little man?
Well,where am I supposed to go? My mom kicked me out,
and those friends I was staying with in Portland were like,
"You gotta pay rent or you gotta leave..."
And... I can't pay rent. I don't have a job.
I don't have anything.
You can stay with me.
Really?
Sure. Just until you figure things out.
You're gonna be okay. Sloans are tough.
You hear that? We're tough.
Maybe we should... keep him.
Do you think you could?
Maybe.
You want to hold him?
No. I... I don't think I know how to...
Do you want to hold him? He's pretty great.
Look who it is.
Hi,baby.
Look at that.
You're a natural.
It's up to you.
If you think we can do this,raise him...
together...
if you think we can,then...
Hey,guys.
He really needs to go to the nursery to be monitored
and get his newborn checkup.
I'm monitoring,and I did the exams.
He's all good.
Mark,when you get a minute,I'd love to have a quick word.
Hmm. Caught a big one,huh?
That's funny.
He's got a small hematoma.
Hey,can I ask you something?
Why did you hire Altman?
What'd you see in her?
Well,what do you see in her?
I think she's good. She works hard.
I feel bad even looking.
I'll feel worse,though,letting a stronger candidate pass us by.
Not the feel-good job,is it?
Can't you give me a little insight?
No. See,that'd be doing the job for you.
I'm not gonna give you the fish.
You got a big hook in there.
Learn to fish yourself.
What kinda life is that,
living five months at a time on a boat,
working 20 hours in terrible conditions?
In 2007,the C.D.C. marked crab fishing
the most dangerous job in the U.S.,with an annual fatality rate
28 times higher than any other job. What?
Dude,it's like working with Forrest Gump.
The kid's 15.
He should be doing algebra,going to school dances.
How much you bet he did it?
What?
Hooked his old man on purpose.
I'd say 70%,it was an accident,30% attempted murder.
What? Karev's right.
Too much nature makes people crazy.
Ah,okay. There... is the tear.
Grey,you want to embolize it?
Really? I've never done it before,
but I... I read that if you use...
You want this kid to bleed to death or what?
Don't analyze everything.
Just... do it.
Tell me that you called the parents.
Sloan's having second thoughts.
Sloan picked those parents. She asked you to call them.
She was pretty clear.
Well,now she's not clear.
By law,she's got 48 hours
before the court terminates her parental right.
Sloan changed her mind?
Maybe.
That's great.
No,it's not.
What,she can't change her mind?
People change their minds.
This baby needs parents,
not an 18-year-old child
and a father who she met five minutes ago.
Shut up!
Mark...
No.
You know,you don't get to tell me what to do here.
I appreciate your help,but you don't...
My mom is dead.
My dad's never gonna get off the couch again.
I don't have any brothers or sisters.
This is my grandson...
My grandson.
I'm not just gonna turn him over to some strangers
when I might have a chance at a family.
So just... give me a minute here.
How's he doing?
His temp's high. I... I can't figure out why.
Is his dad in surgery yet?
Yeah,they're prepping him now.
Doug,
would you like to see your dad before he goes into surgery?
He's probably calmed down.
He hates me.
He's always hated me.
And now I practically killed him.
He doesn't want to see me.
Once when I was little,
I was really mad at my mom,and...
I had heard that saccharine can kill you,
and so... I swear to God,I almost put,like,
ten packets of sweet'n low into her coffee all at the same time.
I w... I was this close.
And while she was thinking of sweetening her mom's coffee,
I tried to run my old man over with a car. It's normal.
No,that's... that's not normal.
Those hooks were meant to catch sharks.
He's never letting me near him or the boat again.
I don't even know where I'm supposed to go.
Ow. Ow,my head is,like,pounding.
Hey,we should get blood cultures and a repeat C.B.C.
We need to find out why he's burning up.
You do that,Sweet'N low.
I'm gonna go watch them pull out a hook.
The baby smiled at Mark.
He looked up and smiled at him like he knew him.
That poor baby's parents,
just sitting...
Stop calling them the baby's...
that baby's parents...
The mature,capable,financially secure,
emotionally stable,loving parents,
who were deemed fit by Sloan and the state of Washington,
are sitting there by the telephone
staring at the sky blue nursery walls that they just painted.
Those are the parents.
Not Mr. Midlife crisis
and his teenage kid
who... who bought her infant son a bag of lollipops
and juicy couture onesies.
So she has a lot to learn.
No,she doesn't.
She made the one sound parenting decision she needs to make.
She found a lovely couple to raise her baby.
And she did that months ago,
when she wasn't flooded with postpartum hormones
or... or overwhelmed by heartfelt pleas from her dad,
when she had time to think clearly...
About what was right for her and...
and what was right for the baby.
She made a decision,a good decision.
And it would... it would
be great if we could just try and respect that.
Crap. Sloan.
Is he okay?
I... I don't know. Uh,he won't stop crying.
Well,what happened?
I...
I don't know. I was just holding him,
when Mark was to go get a bottle for him.
and he's not stopping,and I think something's wrong.
What happened?
Sloan got worried. She paged us.
But the baby's fine.
Oh,he's just hungry is all.
No,I... I don't know how to do this. I don't...
You can't do it wrong,
and we're right here if you need help.
No,no,no,he's crying.
I... I don't think...
I don't think he wants me to do it. Please.
Here. Oh,God. I don't feel so good.
Well,you've been up all night.
You're exhausted and dehydrated. Drink that.
Thought I'd check to see how far along we are.
Almost ready to extract the hook.
Suction.
After they get him off the hook,
we'll go in to evacuate the hematoma
and plate the skull fragments,right?
No,I thought we'd throw him back in. Catch and release.
Thank you,Dr. Kepner.
Well,Walter's lucky.
It looks like he doesn't have to lose any lung.
Yeah,no thanks to his kid.
Mm.
Well,it was an accident. That happens.
That kid shouldn't have been there in the first place.
Well,he's the guy's son... family business.
There's something to be said for loyalty.
You put a person in a job like that
because they have the skills to handle it,
not because they're your friend or your kid.
Are you intentionally equating me with the idiot son
that dropped the crab cage on his dad
or is that just a happy coincidence?
All right. We are to extract the hook from the man.
All right,nobody move but Dr. Hunt.
On my count.
One...
Two...
Snagged an artery...
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry.
God bless you.
He's stabilized and ready for you.
I'm sorry.
Look,if this doesn't go your way,
please don't take it personally.
You're an incredible surgeon. I see that.
It's just that Evans has published dozens of times.
He's won awards.
She won a bronze star for service to her country.
Does that not count?
And the anastomosis is done.
Fine suture hook.
You're not using a side clamp?
Nah.
It's a special technique.
I get a very clean...
very nice anastomosis this way.
Much less trauma to the surrounding structures.
You just parachuted that vein graft down.
Is... is that to avoid memory in the suture or tangles later on?
Excellent observation,Yang.
Have you already applied for your fellowships?
Oh,I'm only in third year.
Oh,right. I forgot.
It feels like I'm working with a fellow.
Thank you.
Oh,would you like me to cut the last suture?
That's OK. I already got it.
It looks like you've barely operated at all.
It's... it's so perfect.
Well,that is the goal,Dr. Yang.
That is the goal.
Excellent.
Hook guy is stable for now. How's the kid?
Crappy.
Nothing to do now that we've finished with the angio.
Lexie's babysitting him.
Hey. Have you,uh,seen Evans?
It was amazing. Who saw?
Dude,you're like a kid with trading cards,
except with heart surgeons.
Yeah. I gotta have 'em all.
I thought Teddy was the love of your life.
Oh,she is. She is.
But... Evans.. Brilliant.
I mean,brilliant.
I mean,so is she. But... I love them both.
I'm a cardiothoracic whore.
What can I say? It feels so good.
Speaking of whores,has anyone seen
the love-struck intern fawning over my husband?
April's not an intern.
You bat your eyes like that,you're an intern.
Oh,don't worry. That's not Derek's thing.
Anymore.
I was the love-struck intern.
It is his thing.
No,he's grown out of it.
Out of what,
chicks who shave their legs and laugh at his jokes?
Sure he's grown out of it.
I shave my legs.
Sometimes.
She's calling him Chief Sheperd.
I don't make the rules.
I'm just telling you, it's a thing.
Powerful guys like adoring girls.
Look, whatever. Do what you want.
That baby's delicious.
Yeah.
I was thinking I could take paternity leave.
You know, at least for a couple of weeks.
I could help Sloan get the hang of things.
I don't know if a couple of weeks is enough.
What? She's a good kid. She's got good instincts.
Well, her instincts led her to put the baby up for adoption.
I don't know.
She's unformed. She's a baby herself.
I don't know.
I don't know either.
Arizona wants to go to Spain.
She's picking a suntan over a family,
which I don't get.
Didn't she have, like, a happy, idyllic childhood?
Totally. She talks to her parents every day,
every day.
Part of which could be the brother thing.
What brother thing?
He died.
Her brother died.
And I'm an idiot.
You have a cold.
It could've happened to any of us.
Yeah, but it didn't.
It was me
on a day that Shepherd is
interviewing Evans for my job.
And I'm the new girl here who no one really knows.
And even Yang... is in love with Evans.
And I
I have a freaking cold.
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.
Okay, what happened?
He became lethargic and febrile, coughed up blood.
His sats dropped out.
His X-ray shows there's
a large hemothorax where we took the hook out.
All right. Well,then we're gonna have to go back in.
The repairs must not have held.
You should get a C.T. to confirm
before cutting into a patient that's unstable.
There's no time for that.
You wait, and he could go
into multi-system organ failure.
Shepherd, you have to trust that I know what I'm doing.
I'll call up to the O.R. Let 'em know you're coming.
Yes, this is Chief Shepherd.
We're gonna need a cardiac O.R.
You paged me. Hey, what's up?
Doug has fever and rigors,
and he's starting to get a productive cough.
So deal with it.
Look, hook guy is tanking. He coughed up blood or something,
so they're taking him back to surgery. I want in.
Wait. He... he coughed up blood. What did it look like?
Was it like currant jelly?
Did he have leukocytosis with a left shift?
His PACO2 was 28,right?
I don't know, Encyclopedia Brown.
I didn't memorize the chart.
Let him go, Grey. He has a surgery he wants to see.
Thank you, Dr. Bailey.
Dr. Bailey, both patients have
productive coughs and signs and symptoms of sepsis.
I am probably wrong,
but if I'm not, this is infectious.
You're probably not wrong. You're probably right.
Why do you want to hand your big save over to Karev,
who's gonna march around the hospital acting like he put it together?
I didn't. I...
You are handing your power over to a boy
because he's giving you sex.
I'm not. I... I...
I'm Dr. Bailey. I know everything.
And you have a superpower.
That memory of yours is a superpower.
And on top of it, you're a good doctor.
And yet, you're letting
Alex Karev treat you like a scut monkey.
I don't care how good the sex is.
If that's what it costs, you're paying too much.
I'm... I'm not...
Scut monkey, all day.
Doctor.
Thank you.
I was right.
I know,
now what are you gonna do about it?
Karev, what's the status on your patient?
Temperature spiked, but the dude's doing fine.
We're running new labs.
Dr. Altman, stop.
Dr. Grey, you always shout at people
right before they start operating?
Doug has klebsiella pneumonia.
And I'm guessing Walter here does, too.
We need to start to imipenem, stat,
or things could get ugly fast.
Klebsiella?
It's highly contagious in close quarters,
like living on a crab boat for months at a time.
And I think that hemothorax is a mixture of blood and an empyema.
Thanks for the heads-up.
Yeah, well, you were busy.
Maybe we should open him to check anyway.
No, I,um...
I... I think I was wrong here.
Get him out of the O.R.,into the ICU now.
This day has to end.
Oh, tell me about it.
I was supposed to watch Tom Evans work.
Meanwhile, I got stuck in an O.R. all day
watching Teddy Altman decompose right in front of my eyes.
I don't understand. What's Tom Evans doing here?
Taking a look around.
Why? You don't need Evans. You got Teddy.
I don't need Teddy if I've got Evans.
What? No,you... you can't.
Me and... me and Teddy, w...
Oh, God. See, this is my point exactly.
I can't staff this hospital, based on the fact
that she's Hunt's friend and your flavor of the month.
You know what? I'm just sick of worrying about this.
This job is exhausting.
I'm sorry. That's what you're complaining about?
Screw you.
I'm losing everything today.
Everything!
Go ahead.
How am I supposed to call a couple of strangers
and tell 'em to come take my kid?
Sloan's your kid, Mark.
You're not losing her.
They're not taking her.
Hey! Did you see me in the O.R.?
You're an idiot.
What?
You really think that Evans is gonna take you under
his award-winning wing? He won't.
He doesn't need you. He doesn't care about students.
He's a rock star, not a teacher.
He is a rock star.
Teddy, he's totally a rock star.
I mean, did you see him in there?
He was like an octopus doing a million things,
like cutting, retracting, suctioning all at once.
You think that I need you to
hold my instruments when I operate?
You think that helps me save the patient?
I do it so that you can learn, Cristina.
I'd be a lot faster in the O. R. without you.
Did you notice? Your gloves were
totally clean at the end of surgery.
Did you learn a lot?
Teddy, it was one surgery.
He's here for my job, Cristina.
Do you really not get that?
If Evans is in, I'm out.
So, you know, good luck with your new attending.
I get it.
You watch parents go through horrible...
unimaginable pain, every day.
And... you went through horrible,
unimaginable pain when you lost your brother.
And your parents never got over it.
But if we had a baby...
our baby's not gonna be
one of those kids in your NICU.
Our baby won't be your brother.
I mean, knock on wood, but...
Do you know how happy our baby would be?
I'm gonna say this once,
and then I'm not gonna say it again.
I'm not broken. I'm not some psychodrama.
My lack of interest in having a child is not some persology
you can pat yourself on the back for having diagnosed.
I like my life. I like it the way that it is.
I don't want it to change.
I thought I liked it with you in it.
I hope I'm not wrong.
Wait.
I called your mother.
What?
Why? She kicked me out.
She's on her way. She misses you.
She's worried about you.
Right.
I'm worried about you, too.
Okay,
if this is the part where you tell me that you talked to her
and she convinced you that me keeping my baby was a bad idea
because I'm young and irresponsible...
That's not what the conversation was about.
Okay, well... so you thought it over
and you decided that you don't have time for a kid?
That's fine. I get it. You have a life. You're busy.
But you know what? I can handle this kid on my own.
No, you can't.
Having a kid is hard.
And you are young and irresponsible.
And keeping him is probably a bad idea.
But if that is your decision,if that's what you want,
then I'm in. I'm all in.
I'm not too busy for my family.
But...
don't keep the baby for me.
You'll always have me.
And I'll always want you.
And that's true no matter what you decide.
You're my kid.
And I'm so happy...
I get to know you, Sloan.
I'm so happy about that.
What are you doing right now?
Can we walk and talk at the same time?
Where are we going?
You need to talk to Derek Shepherd about Teddy
and why replacing her with Evans would be a huge mistake.
Remember, be persuasive and strong.
Use a lot of words.
Cristina, I am not 12.
I'm not saying that you're 12...
Dr. Yang, good work today.
Thank you, Dr. Evans.
This is important.
Shepherd.
Hunt.
Look, before you say anything, I just want you to know
that I think,uh... she's a fine surgeon.
Evans is interested?
Yeah, I think so.
Well...
Well, Evans is good. He's really good.
And patients would come here from all over.
That would be... that would be good for this hospital.
Well, I'm glad you feel that way.
Yeah, and Teddy has a lot of connections...
mainly on the east coast, so she'd be fine.
If that's what you decide...
she'd be fine.
Thank you.
All right, Walter. I need you to squeeze my hands.
All right. Let's do a little push against them.
Not bad, all things considered.
You like being Captain?
Do I like it?
No.
Me neither.
You know what it beats, though?
It beats not being Captain.
Come here, son.
You ok?
This was my fault.
And I'm sorry.
Thanks, dad.
Now just remember,
the Sloans, we bloom early.
So when you start to grow hair on your face, don't be shy.
Live it up.
All the other guys will be jealous.
And it's okay to rub it in a little bit.
But not a lot.
You don't want to be considered too full of yourself.
No one likes a vain guy in the locker room.
Mark.
Oh, my God.
Is that him?
Hey there.
Hi there, little guy.
He's so beautiful.
This is...
And, this...
Thank you.
He has your dad's chin.
What?
That's crazy.
Come in.
Chief Shepherd...
Are you busy?
Did you just call me Chief Shepherd?
I did.
Go with it.
What are you doing with the shades?
Shh. No one can know.
No one can know what?
About our secret love, Chief Shepherd.
Our secret love?
By the way, Chief, I picked up your dry cleaning for you.
And I...
had your car washed.
And I dusted off your desk...
...with my bottom.
Is there anything else I can do for you, Chief Shepherd?
Let me see if I can come up with a list of things.
Oh, Chief Shepherd.
Give me a beer.
You screwed me today. That was my patient.
You made me look like a moron. Get your own beer.
You... you can't be an ass to me all day
and then expect me to give you respect.
You can't be an ass to me all day
and then expect me to give you sex.
And you can stop with the patronizing nicknames.
I am a nice person who
couldn't even bring myself to attempt matricide by Sweet'N Low.
That makes me charming to anybody else.
I am a nice person and I am nice to you.
So whatever your damage is,
you better start to be freaking nice to me,
or I am not spreading my legs for you anymore,
no matter how much I may want to.
Now give me a damn beer.
As doctors...
we have an arsenal of weapons at the ready...
My cousin's baby punched her in the face.
Literally.
She had a black eye from a 1 year old.
Who needs it, right?
I don't need that.
They scream, they're grimy,
they... smell like poop, and the house smells like poop.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't.
Antibiotics to kill infections...
Narcotics to fight pain...
Tell me you're staying.
Please.
I'm staying.
Okay.
Okay.
Scalpels and retractors to remove tumors and cancers...
Derek.
to eradicate the threat...
I heard you gave Teddy a contract.
Yes,I did.
Well, I'm glad. It was the right move.
Loyalty... it's a powerful thing.
It makes for a great Chief.
I offered it to Evans.
He passed.
but just the physical threat.
For every other kind...
you're on your own.
