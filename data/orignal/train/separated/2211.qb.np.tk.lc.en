so that i didn &apos;t get to do it .

something you don &apos;t want to share with us ,
you know , we understand .
yeah , we totally understand , steve .
the last thing we would want to do is make you uncomfortable .
yeah . you can tell us when you &apos;re ready , boss .
you guys suck at reverse psychology .
well , then tell us the damn story , why don &apos;t you ?
all right , you all know that i &apos;ve been trained
by the u.s. government to resist interrogation , right ?
that &apos;s fine . so we &apos;ll just keep taking bad guesses , then .
how &apos; bout that ?
okay .
you were opening a bottle of champagne
and the cork exploded in your face .
black eye .
yes .
all them damn bullets you &apos;ve been dodging for years ,
and you end up gettin &apos; hit in the face with a cork projectile .
see , now that &apos;s what you call ironic .
hey , you know what ? you don &apos;t get to make jokes
when you show up to work in a suit
that &apos;s been mia since 1972 .
* get down , get down *
* get down , get down *
* get down , get down *
i &apos;m having a dream .
we &apos;re all at a temptations concert .
oh , yeah , that &apos;s funny .
you joke ,
but there &apos;s a very sad story
that goes with this suit .
oh , i bet .
if you paid money for it , it &apos;s definitely a sad story .
you gonna tell us what happened , here ?
i &apos;ll tell you what happened .
right after you tell me why you rockin &apos; the panda eye .
all right , grimace .
no , steve , come on .
we want to know how a navy seal
gets a black eye on a date , huh ?
hey . what up ?
whoa , you guys look , uh ... terrible .
right ? you , too .
you look terrible , too . you don &apos;t .
you look fantastic .

thanks , danny .
we were just talking about who had the crappiest valentine &apos;s day .
oh . sorry , kono .
it &apos;s okay . i get to see adam in a couple of days .
why don &apos;t you tell kono what happened
to , uh , with the eye shadow ?
yeah , go ahead , champ .
make her feel better .
is there a crime scene here ?
maid arrived about an hour ago .
found a woman , launa cruz ,
unresponsive on the bathroom floor .
gsw to the chest .
emts detected a faint pulse .
they took her to kuakini .
she &apos;s in critical condition .
okay . clearly , there was a struggle .
one shot went into the wall ,
one went into our vic .
she went into the tub .
the killer must have left ,
thinking he , uh , he &apos;d done the job right .
okay , so what do we know about ms. cruz ?
married to a contractor named jack cruz .
they live on the north shore .
she &apos;s a long way from home .
what about this place ?
it &apos;s owned by a company called purview properties .
established five years ago .
uh , they rent houses and apartments to people having affairs .
it &apos;s like a sex pad .
yeah . no paper trail .
no questions asked .
purview properties .
bustin &apos; up marriages since 2010 .
we &apos;ll reach out to them ,
find out whose name is on the contract .
looks like little ms. cruz
was stepping out on her husband .
where , uh , where &apos;s jack cruz ? anybody know ?
haven &apos;t been able to reach him .
well , what a shock .
okay . so we &apos;re thinking that , uh , mr. cruz
found out mrs. cruz was having an affair ,
came here and tried to kill her ?
or something went down with the person that she was meeting .
well , whatever the case may be ,
i think we can all agree that launa cruz
is having a far worse valentine &apos;s day than any of us .
oh , my daisy , what have they done to you ?
what have they done to you ?
they changed you .
she hasn &apos;t changed a bit !
come on !
you take any longer
and they are gonna need to cut the grass .
you have someplace you &apos;d rather be ?
busiest night of the year tonight .
yeah ?
why &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s valentine &apos;s day .
what ?
it &apos;s valentine &apos;s day . the busiest night .
what ? !
you can still save a par here .
forget par , chef . i forgot valentine &apos;s day .
listen , chef , i need a favor .
you can use your influence
and @-@ and get a table for me and renee tonight , right ?
no . impossible .
so we have been booked solid for a month .
i &apos;m a dead man .
what about your par ?
you win !
thank you !
sorry !
can i help you ?
hey , hey , happy valentine &apos;s day , baby .
oh , okay . okay .
i @-@ i see . you @-@ you thought , you thought i forgot .
but you got played ,
&apos;cause i wanted to be able to give you a real , genuine
valentine &apos;s day surprise , baby !
oh , so you @-@ you didn &apos;t forget .
hell , no .
like you &quot; didn &apos;t forget &quot; my birthday last year ?
and you &quot; didn &apos;t forget &quot;
our wedding anniversary the year before that ?
see , why you gotta bring up old stuff ?
hey , come on , now .
why can &apos;t you see this for what it is ?
your man is home ,
standing in front of his beautiful wife ,
offering you these flowers and these @-@ these chocolates
as a token of my love .
oh , no , i see ...
you know , i see what this is .
i knew you would .
oh , yeah , no , no , i see .
i see a man , mmm ...
yes , you do .
who ran out ,
and bought the last sorry bunch of gerbera daisies
from the convenience store over there on durely street .
how you know that ?
you didn &apos;t even take the sticker off .
and i see the suit
that i brought to the dry cleaners last week
because i was going to donate it to the salvation army .
what ?
and i see ...
i see a man , mmm ...
still wearing his golf shoes .
oh , yeah .
yeah .
hey , i taught you well .
you really are a cop &apos;s wife .
and you , louis purnell grover ...
are in the doghouse .
24 hours , no parole .
what ... ?
that man ...
oh , no .
yeah , yeah , yeah , laugh it up .
okay , so what does a night in the doghouse look like ?
i &apos;ll tell you what it looks like .
me in a janky motel
on a horrible mattress stuffed with nails
and a wafer @-@ thin wall
with some freaky couple on the other side of it
trying to set a new sex endurance record .
lou , why didn &apos;t you come to my place ?
i mean , mi casa su casa , you know that .
oh , i came to your house ,
but it was completely dark .
i figured you were in there romancing ,
so i went over to danny &apos;s house .
right . well , the romance was
definitely not happening over at my place .
yeah , it looked like he was in there
playing charades or something .
charades ? you were playing charades or something ?
i was not playing charades .
melissa and i had a , um , what do you call it ?
an exchange of opinions .
an exch ... oh ! okay , yeah .
us married folks call that a fight .
so then i just went to a motel .
what about my place ?
were you even at home ?
nope .
well , then !
all right , that &apos;s my sorry @-@ ass valentine &apos;s day story .
come on , now , mcgarrett , come on .
time for you to share .
why is everyone so obsessed ?
i don &apos;t see how a humiliating story
about me is gonna make anyone feel any better .
you know , it just might .
okay , fine , i &apos;m happy to oblige
right after chin steps up , how &apos; bout that ?
okay , fair enough .
guys , there is absolutely nothing to tell .
hey , abby , it &apos;s me again .
listen , i @-@ i just wanted to say that ,
you know , whatever you &apos;re going through ,
i hope you know that you can tell me .
okay ?
just give me a call me back .
thanks .
got voice mail again ?
yeah .
hey , you know , silence doesn &apos;t always mean
something bad &apos;s going on .
i &apos;m sorry , kono .
here i am , blabbing about my situation ,
and you &apos;ve got adam in prison .
oh , no , it &apos;s all right .
at least i didn &apos;t humiliate myself at the kahala last night .
you don &apos;t have to remind me , okay ?
‭ speaking of which--
will you do me a favor ?
don &apos;t let the guys know about my nightmare , okay ?
because if they do , i &apos;m just gonna be a punch line
between now and december .
got it .
thank you .
chin . kono .
duke .
chin , it was , uh ... very good to see you last night .
so what &apos;s the latest ?
mrs. cruz is in a coma .
doctors are doing everything they can .
it &apos;s not looking good .
all right , well , once she &apos;s stable ,
let &apos;s get csu in here and collect some evidence .
of course , but there &apos;s something else you should know .
all right , so according to duke ,
launa cruz contacted hpd yesterday
to report her husband missing .
the thing was it was less than 48 hours ,
so no official investigation was opened .
well , that changes things .
there &apos;s more .
mrs. cruz ... had a clear abrasion
between her thumb and forefinger .
it &apos;s the kind of injury typically associated
with the slide of an automatic weapon
as it catches the skin when it goes back .
wait a minute , she fired the gun ?
well , here &apos;s the thing :
her prints aren &apos;t anywhere on the champagne glasses .
okay , well , maybe we got this whole thing wrong .
maybe jack cruz was the one having the affair .
he was using that house to do so .
launa shows up to confront him , they wrestle over the gun .
all right , so our victim started out as our perp .
well , the good news is we were able to figure out
whose prints were on the champagne glasses .
now , lab matched them back to a natalie jacobs .
she &apos;s in the system for solicitation .
she &apos;s also in the books at a high @-@ priced escort agency .
two grand a date .
yeah , if my husband was having valentine &apos;s day with a hooker ,
i &apos;d show up with a gun too .
and i thought i messed up .
this guy &apos;s got to be a lock for husband of the year .
this is the man you spent valentine &apos;s day with .
no .
okay , natalie , we found your prints
at a crime scene on ocean drive .
i &apos;m not denying that i was at that house .
i &apos;m saying that &apos;s not the guy that i was with .
okay , who @-@ who &apos;s the guy that you were with ?
he said his name was robert .
but my guess is that &apos;s a lie .
and he wasn &apos;t at all like your guy .
robert looked older ,
had silverish hair and brown eyes .
okay , have you done business with robert before ?
he was a first @-@ time client .
best kind , too .
paid for the girlfriend experience
but was done in under an hour .
okay , uh , do you know anything else about the guy or ... ?
he was sweet .
made an effort to make it romantic .
even bought me a valentine gift .
that &apos;s , uh ... uh , victoria &apos;s secret , right ?
you know your lingerie .
so , what , you believe her ?
i don &apos;t know . i guess , i guess .
i want to see what turns up with the , uh ... with the composite .
what are you looking at me like that for ?
&quot; you know your lingerie &quot;
yeah , i know my lingerie .
i like women in lingerie .
is that , uh , is that a crime ?
no .
you , you probably ... you probably don &apos;t even notice
what a woman &apos;s wearing before you , uh ...
before you , you know ... wh ...
how &apos;s it about me now ?
what are you trying to say , by the way ?
what am i trying to say ?
yeah , what are you trying to say ?
you know , i mean , you &apos;re not
the most patient guy in the whole world .
what are you s ... i &apos;m not a romantic ?
is that what you &apos;re saying ?
buddy ...
when i was , um , about 12 years old ,
i saw , uh , two sea lions mate
at the , uh , turtle back zoo in west orange .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
and i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m pretty sure
that there was more romance in that encounter
than any date you &apos;ve ever had in your entire life .
let me ... you know what ?
what ?
chin .
well , we can throw another theory out the window .
there &apos;s no way that jack cruz
could have been at the crime scene .
oh , yeah ? how can you be so sure ?
&apos;cause we &apos;re standing over his dead body .
i can &apos;t believe i shared my pain
and bared my vulnerable soul ,
and mr. chin ho kelly can &apos;t even tease us with a little tidbit .
come on , chin .
you know , hey , we &apos;re your family , buddy .
there , uh , there &apos;s no ... there &apos;s no judgment here .
there &apos;s no , uh ...
no , it &apos;s your safe place , babe .
it &apos;s your safe place , we promise , come on .
come on , it &apos;s only fair now , brutha .
you know they &apos;re not gonna let this go .
all right . all right .
okay , so ...
abby and i had an amazing dinner at morimoto .
hang on a second .
when @-@ when &apos;d you book that ?
it was a last @-@ minute thing , you know ?
abby wanted to try the braised black cod .
you know how good it is .
so i called the chef , he made it happen .
he was like , &quot; anything for five @-@ o , &quot; you know ?
is that a fact ?
so , anyway , i book a room at the kahala .
i &apos;m lying there in bed , and i &apos;m pouring the champagne ,
i &apos;m waiting for abby to come out of the bathroom .
you can fast @-@ forward over those parts .
i don &apos;t want to hear about these gory details .
what &apos;s wrong with the details ?
uh , well , that &apos;s the sad part , lou .
we didn &apos;t even get to the part
where we do the grown @-@ up stuff .
that &apos;s not quite the entrance i was imagining .
i ... i can &apos;t .
what do you mean ? what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m sorry .
wait a minute .
are you lea ... ?
abby ?
abby !
abby , are you ... ?
abby , hold on !
abby !
look , i made a mistake .
i can &apos;t .
abby . abby .
what the heck is going on ?
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
no , i &apos;ve seen this movie .
and then the nuns come running around the corner , right ?
i wish that happened ,
because then they could &apos;ve called down to the front desk for me .
lieutenant kelly ?
duke .
what &apos;s going on ?
you remember my wife nalani ?
yes , of course , it is lovely to see you again , nalani .
uh , have a lovely evening .
oof , poor duke .
poor duke ? poor mrs. lukela .
what about poor me ?
you know , i still have no idea
how things went south so fast .
well , i @-@ i @-@ i can help you with this one , i think .
in my experience with women ,
it is either something that you said
or did , or both ,
that she , uh , she took the wrong way .
it &apos;s probably some little microscopic teeny @-@ tiny thing
that &apos;s so damn small no man could recognize it .
are you saying that women are irrational ?
you breaking up .
so what happened ? you call her ?
i left her a bunch of messages .
and kono &apos;s been trying to put a positive spin on it all day .
maybe she got a little spooked how fast things were moving .
yeah , or maybe she &apos;s got someone back in san francisco .
you know , i never asked her .
she &apos;s got a life there ,
and one she &apos;s supposed to be heading back to soon .
yeah , well , uh , you know , she could be on social media .
i &apos;m saying you do a little recon .
that would be stalking .
and she &apos;s not . i checked .
oh , greetings , lieutenant kelly , officer kalakaua .
ah , finally , someone &apos;s in a good mood .
indeed i am .
it is entirely due to the lovely evening
i spent in the company of my inamorata sabrina .
sounds like things are still going strong .
actually , it was an anniversary of sorts .
so we decided to return to the place
where our love first blossomed ,
commissary at king &apos;s medical center .
we even ordered the exact same turkey swiss sandwich
and reminisced .
well , it &apos;s good to see that romance isn &apos;t dead .
no , only our victim .
c.o.d. was a gsw administered at
close range to the anterior skull .
ballistics do not match the launa cruz case .
what about time of death ?
uh , according to liver temperature ,
mr. cruz was murdered
sometime between 10 : 00 a.m. and noon on february 13 .
february 13 .
that means jack cruz was dead
at least 24 hours before his wife went
to that house on ocean drive .
so why did she go there ?
so two days ago , jack cruz responded
to an e @-@ mail from a potential new client .
asking to view a spec house
he was building on the north shore .
we think he was being lured there by his killer .
we tried to trace the e @-@ mail ,
but it was a bogus account .
okay , where was launa cruz at the time ?
oh , she was at her usual therapy session
on the other side of the island when her husband was shot .
okay , hold on .
first we thought that launa cruz &apos;s husband
was trying to kill her .
then we thought she was trying to kill him .
then we realized just now
that he &apos;s dead , so who was launa cruz trying to kill ?
we think she might have been trying to kill this guy .
this is the artist composite
of the man that natalie claimed that she hooked up with
at the house on ocean drive .
we ran his face through the databases
but got no hit .
all right , we need to find out who this guy is
and what his connection to launa cruz is too .
i hope she comes out of that coma ,
otherwise we got nothing .
the bra .
what about the bra ?
the , uh , the bra that this guy bought for , uh , natalie .
oh , the victoria &apos;s secret ?
yeah .
don &apos;t ask .
this way .
hello .
detective williams !
nice to see you again .
it &apos;s very nice to see you , as always ... good to see you .
how &apos;d that purchase work out ?
yeah , how did it work out ?
he won &apos;t , um , tell me .
no , uh , i @-@ i don &apos;t think that you want to hear
about my terrible valentine &apos;s day experience .
oh , she didn &apos;t like the perfume ?
perfume ? you bought perfume from here .
yeah , i did .
hey , excuse me for a second .
i thought you said you liked women in nice lingerie .
i do like women in nice lingerie .
okay , carry on .
detective williams bought a beautiful corset a few weeks back .
did he ? a corset ?
yeah , it was ... it was , uh ...
that is specific . uh ,
it &apos;s a ...
easy there . we don &apos;t let him out of the house too much .
listen . i got to ask you a question . um ...
do you , uh , by any chance recognize this guy ?
that &apos;s michael foxton .
he comes here a lot .
knows what he likes .
he &apos;s bought the same lingerie seven times in the past month .
seven times .
i don &apos;t suppose he used
a credit card for any of those purchases ?
only one time from memory .
i @-@ i imagine that was for his wife .
can we get a copy of that , of that transaction , please ?
yes , you may .
thank you .
i love victoria &apos;s .
how you doing ? mrs. foxton ?
yes ?
hi , we &apos;re five @-@ o.
is your husband around ?
uh , no , michael .
he @-@ he &apos;s away on business .
that &apos;s , uh , that &apos;s not him
jumping over the hedge over there ?
it &apos;s him , right ?
have a seat .
okay , why don &apos;t you tell us , uh ,
why don &apos;t you tell us about this woman that you killed ?
uh , her name was launa cruz , by the way .
did you know that ?
no , i didn &apos;t know that was her name .
and before yesterday , i &apos;d never seen
that woman before in my life .
okay , what about her husband ?
yeah , what about her husband ? you kill him , too ?
she came for revenge or what ?
no ! look .
i &apos;m not a good guy . i cheat on my wife .
but i don &apos;t know these people .
that &apos;s the truth , i swear .
all right , why don &apos;t you tell us what happened at that house ?
i partied with this girl natalie .
she left .
i heard a sound .
i thought it was her coming back for something .
it was that woman .
she had a gun .
we struggled .
it went off .
it was self @-@ defense .
i panicked , but i swear
i was gonna turn myself in right when you guys showed up .
you know what &apos;s crazy is the amount of people
that tell me that right after we arrest them .
look , it &apos;s true .
can i get a glass of water , please ?
look , if you tell the truth , you can have anything you want .
look , i &apos;m telling the truth !
he &apos;s having a heart attack , danny .
come on .
come on !
monster .
you &apos;re gonna give yourself a heart attack you drink
any more of those -- you know that , right ?
that was the last one .
good .
no , i mean , that &apos;s the last one .
i &apos;m all out .
good .
yeah , i &apos;ve been awake for , uh ,
56 hours now .
and i am trapped in this automobile with you ,
this very small space , and i &apos;m supposed to stay awake .
and i &apos;m listening to you talk , which is the equivalent
of eating sleeping pills , listening to you talk .
and i &apos;m supposed to stay awake somehow ,
so i @-@ i don &apos;t know what to do .
you could tell us your valentine &apos;s story .
yeah .
be pretty hard for you to fall asleep while you &apos;re talking .
although , my wife says i did it once .
come on , danny .
okay , all right .
i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll tell my , uh , my valentine story .
so , like a gentleman ,
i was the , uh , epitome of romance .
i took romance to the next level .
you did this for me ?
yeah , who else am i gonna do it for ?
come on .
danny , these are so adorable .
a bunny napkin ?
what the hell is wrong with you ?
yeah , i made a bunny napkin . what do you want ?
is there something wrong with you ?
i think it &apos;s cute .
thank you .
would anybody like me to continue my story ?
yes !
okay , so ...
she was very impressed .
she was very happy with the situation .
she loved my flowers .
she loved the @-@ the perfume i got her .
she loved the risotto alla milanese that i made for her .
she thought it was fantastic , delicious .
we &apos;re sitting there . everything is great , right ?
and then , the mood kind of , uh ...
well , we @-@ we exchanged cards .
梅丽莎
what ?
she didn &apos;t like the card .
no , she did not like the card , not particularly .
what did you write in the card ?
i wrote , uh , simply ,
&quot; happy valentine &apos;s day , danny . &quot;
you &apos;re an idiot .
wait a second .
you didn &apos;t even write , &quot; love , danny &quot; ?
no , not love ! i mean , i did , uh ,
at the end i did xoxoxo , bunch of xo &apos;s .
dude , you blew it .
what do you mean i blew it ?
what are you talking about ?
i did all these nice things .
i did a bunny with the ears .
and the flowers and the perfume ,
and the risotto -- what @-@ what @-@ what else ?
what do i got to do ?
i think we &apos;re all team melissa on this one .
i need you to tell me that you want me to stay .
okay , i want you to stay .
not just tonight .
look , look , i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i care about you very , very much .
okay ? i @-@ i love spending time with you .
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand what the problem is .
you can &apos;t say it , can you ?
i can say it ! i can s--
look , people say it all the time .
they say it a million times a day ,
and it doesn &apos;t mean anything !
i say it , it means something !
oh , right , okay .
well , you &apos;ve never said it to me .
that is not true . is that-- ?
that &apos;s actually true ? is that true ?
is this about rachel ?
no ! this is about how much time you make for me !
about whether or not i &apos;m a priority !
you are a priority . you are a priority .
you are a priority , okay ?
you are !
you &apos;re not listening !
i am ! you are a priority .
you are ...
okay , so what-- it &apos;s over ?
i don &apos;t know what it is . i don &apos;t know .
i got called to the crime scene yesterday ,
and then she was still in bed when i left and that &apos;s that .
all right , so what are you gonna do about it ?
i don &apos;t know .
you better hope we never solve this case ,
so you don &apos;t have to go home again .
what ?
look , i appreciate the support ,
but don &apos;t you have something shrimp @-@ related to do ?
hostility &apos;s out of character .
maybe your blood sugar is low .
look , if i &apos;m cranky ,
it &apos;s &apos; cause the clock is ticking .
i need to find a connection between these two men .
the team &apos;s counting on me .
you want to know how real pressure looks like ?
it &apos;s like playing russian roulette with chocolate .
you throw away the guide .
then you pick a candy .
if you get the fruit center ,
game over , brah .
you got the stones to play ?
thanks .
but no .
this is my valentine ritual .
every year i get the same box of chocolates
from a secret admirer .
what secret admirer ?
don &apos;t know . that &apos;s why they secret .
you know , i could probably find out who they are .
you know , using my detective superpowers and this computer .
well , mainly this computer .
thanks , but nah .
the key to romance is mystery .
the secret to our mystery is right here !
oh , what is that ?
you just got the bullet , my friend .
oh , commander !
you wanted to find a connection between cruz and foxton ?
well , here it is .
both men are members of the makai country club .
so they &apos;re golfing buddies .
except i spoke to the manager of the pro shop ,
and cruz and foxton never share tee times .
but here &apos;s the thing :
the wives had lunch with each other at the club
five times in the past month alone .
all right , so there &apos;s attempts on both the husband &apos;s lives
within a 24 @-@ hour period ,
and both the wives have rock @-@ solid alibis .
two strangers in unhappy marriages agree
to kill each other &apos;s spouses with no apparent motive .
it &apos;s strangers on a train .
hitchcock .
gentlemen , michael foxton is stable .
so you can talk to him now .
but there &apos;s something you should know .
it wasn &apos;t stress that caused his heart attack .
i told the doc i took my heart pills .
well , you sure about that ?
because he just said
the medication wasn &apos;t in your system .
that &apos;s why you went into cardiac arrest .
it &apos;s impossible , &apos; cause tessa gave them to me
last night at home .
your @-@ your wife , who you are presently cheating on ,
she controls the medication that determines
whether you live or die ?
yeah .
okay , whatever your wife gave you
wasn &apos;t your heart pills , all right ?
okay , so , we , uh , got a couple angry wives
having a bunch of lunches and , uh ,
a doctor &apos;s word against tessa &apos;s
that this guy took the right medication .
she could &apos;ve given him aspirin , right ?
and what &apos;s she gonna do ? she &apos;s got plenty of money .
she &apos;s gonna lawyer up .
and she &apos;ll walk .
is everything all right ?
mrs. foxton , your husband , uh ,
he had a heart attack in custody .
what ? !
he @-@ he &apos;s all right , though ; he &apos;s stable .
and the doctors think that he &apos;s @-@ he &apos;s gonna be just fine .
oh , oh , thank god !
there is some good news .
launa-- launa cruz has come out of her coma .
yeah , it &apos;s just a matter of waiting for her to , uh ,
regain enough consciousness so we can question her .
just , you know , to make sure that her story
matches up with your husband ... we &apos;re good .
thought she wasn &apos;t gonna take the bait .
target &apos;s on the move .
i got eyes on the suspect .
she &apos;s headed inside .
i &apos;m tessa foxton .
i &apos;m here to see my husband michael .
he &apos;s in room 323 . third floor .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s over , tessa .
i &apos;m sorry to say that launa didn &apos;t make it .
she passed away earlier this morning .
what &apos;s going on ? they said she was alive .
and we were right .
you came here to silence the one person
that knew you killed jack cruz .
he used to beat her , you know .
watch your head .
well , i guess we can put an end to the argument
on who had the worst valentine &apos;s day , right ?
yeah , you know , i was just about to suggest
we all go home and get a good night &apos;s sleep ,
and then i remembered ... mcgarrett .
it &apos;s time , boss .
fine . not here .
* been standing in a corner *
* studying the lights *
* dreaming of escape *
* will keep you up at night *
* but someone had put the flares up *
* got me in the rays *
* so ... *
* guess i better stay ... *
hey , jer . what &apos;s with the getup ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
he &apos;s got a hot date .
or not .
depending if she shows .
thanks , big guy . helpful words .
what ?
what ?
look , we met online and neither of us wanted to do
the cheesy valentine &apos;s day thing , so , you know ,
we &apos;re just gonna ... - jerry ...
jerry , it &apos;s not that i &apos;m not interested .
i &apos;m not .
but , uh , that &apos;s not it .
right now , the campfire session belongs to mcgarrett .
oh , he &apos;s gonna explain the black eye ?
yes , sir .
cool .
so , uh , it all started on valentine &apos;s day morning .
you mind if i borrow a shirt ?
what do you want a shirt for ?
yes , you can borrow a shirt .
second drawer down .
she found your phil collins t @-@ shirt and that was it .
she was done .
very funny . she found the ring .
what ?
wait , the ring ?
yeah , the ring . she found the ring
that i bought for catherine , the engagement ring .
that is an &quot; oof . &quot;
yes , it was , it was definitely an &quot; oof . &quot;
okay , so what was it doing in your dresser ?
you know , the funny thing
is that was the question lynn asked me .
what is this ?
she felt that i &apos;d been hiding something from her .
uh , well , you were . the ring .
yeah , and with the seriousness of @-@ of
my relationship with catherine ,
the fact that i was gonna ask her to , uh , to marry me .
she doesn &apos;t want to be part of a rebound thing ,
which is understandable ,
and , uh , she thinks my head &apos;s not in the game .
okay , so how did it end ?
um , not well .
she left . she was very upset .
that &apos;s terrible . sad story .
listen , uh , i came here to hear about the black eye .
i got it .
she hit you with the ring .
nope .
no ?
okay , all right . how about this ?
you were rooting around in the closet looking for something ...
baseball falls off a shelf ,
hits you right in the eye .
no .
got hit in the head with a coconut .
you dropped a practice grenade on your face .
you walked into a tree .
you fell into a doorknob .
got kicked by a horse .
yeah , i don &apos;t know why i said that .
now , can i just ... ?
just settle down , okay ?
we went to morimoto &apos;s , the private room .
the private room ?
yeah , i called the chef .
the restaurant was at capacity ,
so he put me in the private room .
so i pulled out all the stops ,
beautiful dinner ,
we had a lovely evening ,
she was very happy .
all was forgiven , all right ?
we get back to my place , everything &apos;s going very well .
lynn decides to make it up to me .
oh . little mood music . that &apos;s a good move .
* baby , take off your coat *
* real slow *
that &apos;s it ?
you got hit in the face with a lady heel ?
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s ... that &apos;s it ?
a &quot; lady heel &quot; ?
this thing , this thing ... it was like a four ...
a five @-@ inch wedge .
you seen those things ? it &apos;s like a ...
it &apos;s like a tomahawk .
um , hi .

i got a lady waiting for an apology .
i should put that laundry in the dryer .
