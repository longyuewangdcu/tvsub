okay , babydoll pink ,
let &apos;s see if you can cover up the fact that i got my dad &apos;s feet .
it &apos;s just two degrees , sheldon .
i just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees !
let me point out that two degrees
can be the difference between water and steam .
yes , if we lived in a teakettle .
this is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement .
aw , screw the roommate agreement !
no , you don &apos;t screw the roommate agreement .
the roommate agreement screws you .
you know what , go to hell and set their thermostat .
i don &apos;t have to go to hell .
at 73 degrees , i &apos;m there already !
who is it ?
leonard .
hang on .
can i sleep on your couch tonight ?
uh , well , you can try ,
but the people across the hall are being very noisy .
you heard that , huh ?
apparently , the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat ,
then the other fella went bat @-@ crap crazy .
so you agree , he &apos;s nuts .
well , not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him .
believe it or not , he was worse when i met him .
oh , i do not believe that .
you are so naive .
just like i was seven years ago .
i &apos;d just started at the university .
excuse me , i &apos;m looking for sheldon cooper &apos;s apartment .
oh , i bet you &apos;re here to check out the room for rent .
yeah .
run away , dude .
what ? !
run fast , run far .
that should have been my first clue .
so sheldon &apos;s last roommate tried to warn you off ?
for all i knew , he was the crazy one .
he had this really deranged look .
well , yeah , he &apos;d been living with sheldon .
sure , it makes sense now .
anyway , i went upstairs and knocked on the door .
yeah ?
dr. cooper ?
no , you want the crazy guy across the hall .
in retrospect , that was clue number two .
yes ?
i &apos;m leonard hofstadter .
i called you about the apartment . you said ...
i know what i said .
i know what you said .
i know what my mother said on march 5 , 1992 .
what is the sixth noble gas ?
what ?
you said you &apos;re a scientist .
what is the sixth noble gas ?
uh , radon ?
are you asking me or telling me ?
telling you ?
telling you .
all right , next question .
kirk or picard ?
oh , uh , well , that &apos;s tricky .
um , original series over next generation ,
but picard over kirk .
correct .
you &apos;ve passed the first barrier to roommate @-@ hood .
you may enter .
oh , this is pretty nice .
uh , the bedrooms are back there ?
that depends .
i don &apos;t understand .
their existence is conditional ?
no , but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional
on you passing the second and third barriers .
there &apos;s three ?
each more daunting than the last .
have a seat .
okay .
no ! that &apos;s where i sit !
what &apos;s the difference ?
this seat is ideally located
both in relation to the heat source in the winter
and a cross breeze in the summer .
it also faces the television at a direct angle ,
allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play
without being subjected to conversation .
as a result , i &apos;ve placed it in a state of eternal dibs .
can you do that ?
cathedra mea , regulae meae .
that &apos;s latin for &quot; my chair , my rules . &quot;
now , you said on the phone
that your area of study is physics .
uh , yeah , experimental physics .
what is that ?
doesn &apos;t concern you .
you &apos;ll be going to the university every day ?
yes .
and you have a vehicle ?
a car , yeah .
and you &apos;ll be willing to drive me ?
can &apos;t you drive ?
i can .
i choose not to .
okay , i suppose i could drive you .
that &apos;s a point in my favor , right ?
why don &apos;t you let me do this .
come on , i just asked .
last question .
in a post @-@ apocalyptic world ,
which task would you assign the highest priority ?
locating a sustainable food source ,
reestablishing a functioning government ,
procreating , or preserving the knowledge of mankind ?
uh , i &apos;m gonna go with ... preserving the knowledge .
that &apos;s correct .
fyi , i would have accepted any answer other than procreating .
come , i &apos;ll show you the rest of the apartment .
oh , good .
i passed the barriers .
the second barrier . don &apos;t get cocky .
this is the bathroom .
are you fairly regular ?
uh , i guess .
this isn &apos;t going to work if you &apos;re guessing .
when do you evacuate your bowels ?
when i have to .
when you have to ?
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t rent to hippies .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry , uh , in the morning .
around 8 : 00 .
i can &apos;t give you 8 : 00 . i can give you 7 : 30 .
fine . i &apos;ll take it .
third barrier passed .
you have won the right to see your room .
huzzah .
is this it ?
no , this is my room .
people don &apos;t go in my room .
so where do you sleep ?
i don &apos;t understand .
if people don &apos;t go in there , and you &apos;re people , and ...
you are people , aren &apos;t you ?
making a joke .
do you do this often ?
on occasion .
your room .
you may want to repaint .
and after all that , you just moved in ?
i didn &apos;t just move in .
first we had to iron out a few details .
&quot; roommates agree that friday nights shall be reserved
for watching joss whedon &apos;s brilliant new series firefly . &quot;
does that really need to be in the agreement ?
we might as well settle it now ; it &apos;s going to be on for years .
initial here .
all right , that &apos;s television and movies .
section nine : miscellany .
the apartment &apos;s flag
is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure .
we have a flag ?
never fly it upside down .
unless the apartment &apos;s in distress .
and next .
&quot; if either of us ever invents time travel ,
&quot; we agree our first stop will be this meeting today
in precisely five seconds . &quot;
okay .
that &apos;s disappointing .
why on earth did you agree to all that ?
it was the best apartment i &apos;d seen ,
the rent was very reasonable
and after you &apos;ve passed the first three barriers
you kind of want to take it all the way .
well , i &apos;m sorry , leonard ,
it &apos;s very hard to feel sympathy for you .
okay , how about this ?
let me tell you about the first time i brought a girl over .
leonard ?
shh . just pretend we &apos;re not here .
leonard ?
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll go away .
i &apos;m just going to keep knocking till you answer .
leonard ?
leonard ?
leonard ?
what do you want ? !
i didn &apos;t say come in !
you asked what i wanted .
i wanted to come in .
i &apos;m here because you violated our roommate agreement .
specifically , section eight--
visitors , subsection c ; females , paragraph four-- coitus .
&quot; roommates shall give each other
12 hours notice of impending coitus . &quot;
i didn &apos;t even know her 12 hours ago .
that &apos;s it ! i &apos;m out of here !
but , joyce , come on .
12 hours ?
oh , my god .
do i get some sympathy now ?
a little bit .
ok , let me get this straight .
you move in with this guy ,
he made you sign a rediculous roommate agreement ,
then he walks into your bedroom
while you &apos;re doing this joyce kim
and you still stay .
actually , i couldn &apos;t get too mad at him about joyce kim .
why not ?
well , i was doing some government research at the time ,
you know , military , rocket fuel .
it &apos;s kind of secret .
what does that have to do with joyce kim ?
as it turns out , she was a north korean spy .
luckily , sheldon drove her out
before i revealed anything important .
which i @-@ i &apos;m not saying i would have .
so , what , that &apos;s it ?
you &apos;ve stayed with sheldon all this time
because he kept you from going to federal prison ?
that was part of it .
the other part is what happened with the elevator .
oh , yeah , i &apos;m wondering about that .
you said it was working when you moved in .
it was , but one night , sheldon came home from work ...
what is going on here ?
hey , sheldon .
this is howard and raj .
they work at the university , too .
hey .
hey .
i &apos;ll get to you later .
what are you sitting on ?
i can &apos;t speak for these guys , but i &apos;m sitting on my tushie .
it &apos;s a joke .
not a good idea .
&quot; tushie &quot; is buttocks , right ?
right .
hilarious .
explain the couch .
oh , well , there were some people on the first floor moving out ,
and they sold it to me for $ 100 .
howard and raj helped me bring it up .
but what &apos;s wrong with the furniture we have ?
they &apos;re lawn chairs .
and there was no place for company .
did it occur to you that was by design ?
according to the roommate agreement ,
i &apos;m entitled to allocate 50 % of the cubic footage of the common areas .
but you didn &apos;t notify me by e @-@ mail , so this is still a breach .
i did notify you .
oh , you did , did you ?
oh , drat !
hoisted by my own spam filter .
what am i doing in your spam folder ?
i put you there after you forwarded me
a picture of a cat playing the piano , entitled &quot; this is funny . &quot;
oh , yeah , i saw that .
that was hilarious .
okay , what does all this have to do with the elevator ?
i &apos;m getting to it .
i assure you , you &apos;ll be sorry you wasted your money on an ipod
when microsoft comes out with theirs .
okay , do you have an opinion about everything ?
yes .
and you just assume you &apos;re always right ?
it &apos;s not an assumption .
change seats with me .
why ?
i don &apos;t like this spot .
i have to keep turning my head .
fine .
ooh , it &apos;s time for babylon 5 !
we don &apos;t watch babylon 5 in this apartment .
why not ?
because no one likes babylon 5 .
i like it .
me , too .
so do i.
there you go-- three against one .
they don &apos;t get a vote .
it &apos;s one against one .
and according to the roommate agreement ,
all ties will be settled by me .
but i said no to that .
and i said yes .
and i settle all ties .
change seats with me .
why ?
there &apos;s a draft on my neck over here .
so , i get the draft ?
you &apos;re protected by your turtleneck .
fine .
and it &apos;s a dickey .
i &apos;m still not comfortable .
of course .
there &apos;s too many people here .
we can fix that .
let &apos;s leave .
yeah , we can go over to my place .
wait .
let me get my jacket .
you &apos;re not going with us .
why not ?
you &apos;re the guy we &apos;re trying to get away from .
well , in that case , i don &apos;t need my jacket .
and for the record , the correct syntax is :
i &apos;m the guy from whom you &apos;re trying to get away .
oh , yes .
this is definitely going to be my spot .
okay .
how do you know he said that ? you left the room .
hey , do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not ?
fine . go ahead .
howard , are you having a playdate ?
i don &apos;t have playdates !
i have colleagues !
do their parents know they &apos;re here ?
no , but if you keep screaming , maybe they &apos;ll hear you !
that your dad ?
she grows any more hair on her face , yes .
oh , man . is that a two @-@ stage rocket ?
three . i designed the engine myself .
cool . can it break mach 1 ?
oh , probably , if i could get my hands on that new fuel
the government &apos;s been working on .
oh , this just might be your lucky day .
howard , what happened to the oreos i left on the counter ? !
i haven &apos;t seen your oreos !
just take your bath without them !
so , why was it his lucky day ?
well , it turns out i had a little rocket fuel in the apartment .
what were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment ?
joyce kim was kind of curious about what i did for a living ,
and i was going to kind of show it to her .
it &apos;s not important . the point is ,
the guys and i went back to the apartment .
are we ever going to get to the elevator ?
yeah , we &apos;re really close .
uh , uh , we &apos;re at the apartment .
the trick is to mix it into tovex in order to create a combustible gel
that will generate over 8,000 kilo @-@ newtons of thrust .
cool .
nice .
won &apos;t work .
excuse me , but i &apos;ve been working on this a long time .
trust me-- it &apos;ll work .
you don &apos;t see your mistake , do you ?
there &apos;s no mistake .
this is for a full @-@ scale rocket , not a model .
well , i &apos;ve adjusted the formula .
not correctly .
okay , i &apos;ve had it with you .
you might be an expert on theoretical physics and science @-@ fiction programs
and where to sit on a freaking couch ,
but this is applied physics .
and when it comes to applied physic ... uh @-@ oh .
what &apos;s happening ?
a bad thing . a very bad thing .
get the door .
get the door ! get the door !
get the door ! get the door !
you &apos;re waiting for the elevator ? !
oh . right .
wait . it &apos;s here .
give me that .
what &apos;d you do that for ? i had plenty of time ...
you &apos;re welcome .
not only did sheldon save my life ,
he didn &apos;t rat me out to the landlord .
or the police .
or homeland security .
okay , so , basically , you &apos;re the reason
i have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day ?
so i did something stupid .
i &apos;m sure you did stupid things when you were younger .
what were you doing seven years ago ?
excuse me , i was in high school .
studying , keeping my nose clean ,
doing volunteer work for the community .
not pregnant .
yes !
oh , ubuntu ,
you are my favorite linux @-@ based operating system .
why do i smell methacrylate ?
oh , uh , clear nail polish . i had a mani @-@ pedi .
men can get those .
anyway , i may owe you an apology .
there &apos;s doubt ?
i did agree to the thermostat setting ,
and i shouldn &apos;t have tried to change it .
that &apos;s not an apology .
simply an acknowledgement that i was right .
ok , i &apos;m sorry .
there you go .
so we are good ?
good what ?
never mind .
okay if i watch some tv ?
go ahead .
up next babylon 5 .
you &apos;re not even watching !
i can hear it !
oh , so the dialogue offends you ?
i would hardly call that dialogue !
you &apos;re insane , you know that ? !
don &apos;t make me turn that flag upside down ,
