Welcome, early risers.
The first tour of the day is always the best.
But before we get started, can anyone tell me
about the battleship we're standing on?
Hey!
The Missouri was where the Japanese surrendered
to Allied powers to end World War II.
Very good.
"Mighty Mo" served in battles all over the world.
Since 1992, however, those guns, like the Missouri herself,
have been decommissioned,
and now she enjoys peaceful retirement here in Pearl Harbor.
Now let's get haze gray and underway,
which is ship talk for "We're on the move."
Freeze! Don't move!
Hands up!
Hands in the air!
Down, down, down!
Alright, alright, I'm sorry.
Drop your weapon.
I didn't do it!
Drop your weapon now!
I didn't kill my wife!
Commander McGarrett, Detective Williams.
I wish we were meeting under better circumstances.
Laura Hills.
I recently took over as Governor Jamison's new
Public Safety Liaison.
What do we got?
Suspect on board is Special Warfare Operator
Second Class Graham Wilson. SEAL Team Five.
Hang on. He's a SEAL?
Heavily decorated.
He's holed himself up inside with an unknown number of hostages.
Any contact with him since he's boarded yet?
He told our negotiators he would start killing the hostages
if we tried to move in on him.
Did he make any demands?
Just one-- find his wife's killer.
Huh. That's interesting.
When did that happen?
This morning.
Her name was Noreen Wilson.
Graham's given us four hours to find her killer.
I guess it'd be too much to hope that he mentioned who did it?
Any suspects?
Yes. Him.
HPD found Graham at the crime scene,
holding the murder weapon.
When they confronted him, he ran.
And he wants us to find the killer?
I don't suppose telling him he did it would suffice, huh?
Right now my only concern is getting those hostages off that ship.
Now usually, SWAT would handle something like this,
but the governor seems to think
that with your background as a SEAL,
that you'd be better equipped to handle the situation.
Him? And me-- I'm here for what, entertainment, or what?
Well, you can tell SWAT to sit tight.
I'll go in alone.
Excuse me?
That's just stupid.
Graham's a SEAL.
He's been trained in close-quarter combat,
which means right now he has the high ground.
You send SWAT in blind,
they're going to take heavy losses,
and more than likely get multiple hostages killed.
If this guy didn't kill his wife,
he deserves at least a conversation before we go in guns blazing.
If he did, and he's going to kill again,
I'll take him out myself.
But if you want my help today, you get it my way.
I go in alone.
Okay, uh, let's say I am you,
and you are the bad guy here, okay?
I would know that all the ways onto this ship are visible somehow.
So, how would you outsmart yourself
and get yourself onto that ship,
without yourself seeing... yourself?
Okay, was that an actual attempt at a question,
or are you just kind of throwing words at each other
and hoping they make sense?
How you gonna get on the ship without Graham seeing you? That's all.
Graham's expecting a threat from land,
not from the water.
I'm just going to go for a swim.
You're going to go for a swim?
You're serious? And now you're shirtless. That's great.
Believe it or not, I've done this before.
You've done this before?
You've snuck onto a floating museum to rescue a bunch of tourists
who are being held captive by a man
who is accused of killing his wife?
Well, I didn't mean this literally.
But look, I can't see any other way
of stopping this thing from escalating.
And we only have four hours.
I believe you.
All right, what's-what's your plan?
We're going to hold SWAT in position
so Graham thinks we're still negotiating.
In the meantime, I'll board, try to make contact
while you investigate this murder.
I have to gain his trust,
get him to see that we're working on his behalf.
So maybe I can get these people out safe, Graham included.
But only if he feels like I actually understand him.
Okay. That's great.
What happens when I investigate this case and I find out
he killed his wife-- which he most certainly did. Then what?
At least we'll know what we're dealing with.
HPD says neighbors reported
hearing screams coming from Graham's house.
Cops arrived, they found him with a knife in his hand.
When they tried to arrest him, he fled the scene.
They also found his seven-year-old daughter in the house,
hiding under a couch.
She hasn't talked
since Child Welfare Services took her into custody.
Maybe she saw something that freaked her out.
Okay, I'm going to go see the kid, see if she knows anything,
because, you know, I'm the woman on the team,
you'd probably ask me to do it anyway.
No, no, it's not because you're a woman.
It's because you're a rookie, which is way worse.
Now listen, I'm going to have my phone on me
but don't call me, I'll call you, okay?.
Bet you used that line before.
I'll initiate contact once I'm in a secure location.
That one, too.
Good luck, Aquaman!
Easy, easy, easy, okay?
I'm here to help.
Lieutenant Commander Steve McGarrett.
It's about time some backup arrived.
Boatswain's Mate First Class Ed McKay, U.S. Navy. Retired.
You were running a tour.
Yeah.
We heard shots fired, and then it was chaos,
people running everywhere.
I was able to evac most of my group, but a few fell behind
and that lunatic took them hostage!
How many?
Seven.
And he took them that way, toward the wardroom.
Okay. Good work, Boats.
Listen, getting you off the ship right now is going to be too dangerous.
Is there a safe place that you can lay low for a while?
I'm not hiding anywhere.
And you can put those blueprints away,
because I'm coming with you.
Those are my people that he's got.
I walk this ship front to back, five times a day.
There's not a person alive who knows it better than I do.
Certainly not some map!
Okay. But I say jump, you say how high, you hear me, sailor?
Yes, sir!
And stay out of sight, no matter what I do.
You got it.
Who's going to take care of Lily?
Graham's sister is flying in from Oklahoma.
Arrives tonight.
What about on the mother's side, is no one listed locally?
Haven't found anyone yet.
Has she said anything about her mother's murder?
Hasn't said a word.
Thanks.
Hi, Lily.
My name's Kono.
I bet you've been asked a lot of questions today, huh?
Well, no more questions for now, because I'm hungry,
and I'm going to go get some shave ice
if... you want to come with me.
So you think this guy killed his wife?
He's gone to a lot of trouble to say he didn't.
Please.
Hey. No talking here.
I'm sorry, but sir?
No talking!
Please.
I'm hypoglycemic. My husband went to get me a snack, when...
If I don't eat something soon, I'm going to pass out.
Does anyone have any food for her?
Slow!
They're peanut, it's protein.
Thank you.
Everyone keeps completely quiet. Got it?
Disobey that order and I will hurt you.
That's a promise.
Broken furniture, blood spatter on the walls...
This was a hell of a struggle.
Yeah, makes a lot of sense.
Graham's a Navy SEAL,
and his wife weighs a buck-oh-five, if that.
That's what I'm saying.
This should have been an easy kill.
Why's it so sloppy?
Love and hate, right?
Two sides of the same coin.
That's why they call it a crime of passion.
You know, marital spat escalates,
just like that, he snaps.
He goes from heads to tails.
First he just wants to make her suffer a little bit.
Wife ends up dead.
How long were you married, again?
It's just a theory.
Hmm, Wong Lee.
It's the best dim sum on the island.
You read Chinese?
Yeah, enough to order.
That's good to know.
For the future.
Wait.
This is catching on something, give me a hand.
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.
No chance you also read Russian, right?
No, why?
Well, 'cause it's in Russian.
How do you know?
See the "V"S and backwards "R"S?
I had this case back in Jersey.
Russians trying to muscle in on this crew from North Bergen.
The, uh, press called it the Borscht Bust.
Got my picture in the paper.
Parents must have been very proud.
They misspelled my name.
Husband's file didn't say anything about language training.
Yeah, well, maybe it belonged to the victim.
Let's get it translated.
What's this?
"397."
That's a safe deposit box key.
All right. Let's get both of these checked out.
You, uh, with Graham yet?
Yeah, I got him.
I got eyes on him.
He's armed.
He's holding seven hostages. Behavior's pretty erratic.
Oh, you mean as opposed to most hostage-takers
that are calm and composed.
No, with his training,
this scenario shouldn't bother him.
But he's paranoid, he's unstable.
You know what, check if he's been treated psychiatrically.
Okay.
All right, I'm in the house right now.
Chin, go see if this guy's on any meds.
Hey, uh, while I've got you, uh, we found something.
There's a manuscript stashed away.
It's in Russian.
And, uh, a safe deposit key.
So if it's local, uh,
I can subpoena the contents.
Good. Sounds like you're making progress.
Yeah. You, uh, you miss me, don't you?
Oh, yeah, I wish you were here, but you don't swim.
I don't-I don't swim?
I swim. Very well, actually. I just choose not to.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You talking to your wife?
I'm talking to my partner.
Oh, Graham's medicine cabinet is full-on stacked.
I got sleeping pills, lithium, and Clo-naza-pam.
Clonazepam. Wait a minute, that's a...
that's an antipsychotic,
sometimes used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder.
All the prescriptions are from Dr. Klesko.
Bottles are three weeks old, but they're practically full.
Okay, this is a really stupid question,
but what happens if Graham stops taking his medicine?
Shut up! You don't want to make me angry.
I think we just found out.
I'm also thinking the longer this goes on,
the worse it's going to get.
Who's out there?
McGarrett, I'm sorry.
Go back to the office, okay? Lock the door.
Stay in there.
What the hell are you going to do?
I'm going to cover you, go!
Who's out there? I swear... I swear if you come in
I'll kill these people!
Hands up!
Hey. Don't shoot, man.
I got lost, I was looking for the bathroom.
I don't understand, what's happening?
Hat off.
Hands behind your head.
Please. Please don't shoot me.
Turn around.
On your knees!
Get down.
Keep your mouth shut!
Hey. Hey, you okay?
You don't look too good.
Hey! No talking here.
I don't think she's well, I think she's sick, man.
You look, take a look at her.
She's fine.
I'm okay.
Could-could we get some water at least?
What part of no talking do you not follow?
Dr. Klesko, we got about three hours to figure this thing out.
Can you tell us why you were treating Graham?
His team walked into an ambush in Ba'Quabah, Iraq.
In the crossfire were a group of children, and none of them survived.
The trauma took a huge psychological toll:
mood swings, violent outbursts.
It escalated to the point the MPs were called to his house
for a domestic disturbance.
And you diagnosed him with post-traumatic stress disorder.
Yes, and we were making progress.
Graham was showing real signs of improvement.
And then he had a setback.
What kind of setback?
He became convinced that the drugs were clouding his judgment,
so he started skipping doses, and that only made his paranoia worse.
It got to the point that he started experiencing blackouts.
Blackouts? What, you mean he started passing out?
No. PTSD patients
can slip into a disassociative fugue state.
It happens when they get agitated or perceive a threat.
They can become enraged, sometimes violent.
And when it's over, they have no recollection of what happened.
So it's possible Graham killed his wife without even realizing it.
I'd say it's more than possible.
Don't do it. Don't do it.
Hey!
Who are you?
You're not a tourist.
I said who are you!
My name is Steve McGarrett. I'm Five-O.
But before that I was a SEAL, just like you.
BUD/S class 203.
They send you in here to get me?
No. I came in by myself.
I don't want anyone else involved
until we get a chance to talk straight, okay?
You can tell me what really happened.
For your service,
I thought you deserved at least that much.
I didn't kill my wife.
Okay. I believe you, man.
We're trying to get to the bottom of that right now.
Where is it?
Where's the knife? Where's the knife?
Wait. Graham, Graham, listen,
nobody took your knife, all right?
Maybe you lost it. But you have the gun.
Graham, you have a gun, that's right.
You're in control. Everybody here knows that.
We all know who's in control here.
But you got to listen to me.
If you're telling me the truth,
my team is going to find that out.
They're working the case as we speak,
but you're not making it easy on us, Graham,
holding all these people here.
You know? You got to do the right thing for yourself,
for your daughter.
Where's Lily?
My team has her. She's safe.
I promise you. You have my word.
Let's just let a couple of folks go.
Come on. You're a SEAL and your best tactical advice
is for me to let go of my only leverage?
What are you talking about? You got me.
Take me instead.
I have you, too.
Come on, Graham. You got to give me something, man.
You got to show me a little good will.
At least-at least let me check on this guy
before he bleeds out.
Fine. Clean him up.
Empty your pockets and your purses.
Don't do anything!
Look at the bleeding here.
I got to stop it, I got no supplies.
I need some nail glue, a sewing kit, anything.
Empty them!
Don't try anything.
It's okay, it's okay.
All right, you messed him up pretty good, Graham.
Good news is, you didn't kill him.
I know.
If I wanted him dead, he'd be dead.
Hey, pretty ladies.
Two biggies, on the house.
Aw, thank you, Uncle.
No problem. Anything else, just holla.
Okay.
That's yours.
This one's mine.
Is it good?
My favorite's grape.
You know why?
Makes my, uh, tongue purple. See?
You don't like the lemon?
Daddy eats that part.
So, uh...this one night at BUD/S?
Me and a couple of the guys were, uh,
were sneaking back onto base, right?
And we hear this real mean, crusty,
"Hey. You ladies ready to get wet and sandy?"
Master Chief White.
Yes, sir.
Bet he wasn't too happy, huh?
Are you kidding me?
He was thrilled to catch us.
He gave us five extra hours of cold-water conditioning.
We didn't get out of the water till dawn.
That's tough love for you.
So, Graham, tell me about Noreen.
Where'd you guys meet?
Germany.
Six and a half years ago.
I was traveling through Europe, on leave.
She was working at an all-ranks club in Ramstein.
She'd just emigrated there with her daughter.
Three months later we were married.
From Russia, right?
How did you know?
I told you, my people are investigating.
Well, she changed her name just before we moved to the States.
She didn't like the name Irina anyway.
Just wanted to put her past behind her, you know,
start a new life.
And her daughter Lily, she was, uh,
she was from a previous marriage, right?
Yeah, Lily's father died just before she was born.
Lily...
I can't imagine what she's going through.
Graham, what happened this morning?
We fought.
We argued.
I don't even know
what it was about.
I-I know.
I haven't been easy to live with.
Ever since I've been back,
you know, it's been difficult.
Noreen says sometimes that she's scared of me,
that I'm not even the same guy that she married to.
But I was dealing with it.
I was getting better.
You know, the shrink says, you know, "When you get worked up,
just take two laps around the block.
You know, clear your head."
And that's what I did.
Right, so you left the house.
And when I came back, there she was
in the middle of the living room.
And I tried to resuscitate her.
That's when the cops, they show up.
After all Noreen and I had been through,
I figured they'd think I'd hurt her.
Got scared, I ran.
I'd never hurt Noreen.
And it means everything for Lily to know
that I didn't do this to her mother.
I get it, Graham.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?!
Back!
You don't think I know what you're doing?
Relex, I'm not doing anything.
Huh? We're done. Let's go.
You're done playing nurse.
Graham, this guy needs a CAT scan.
He needs to get off the ship.
Keep me, keep all these other people, but let this guy go.
Prove to me, Graham, prove to me that you're a good man.
All right.
Hey, you're free to go.
Go, get out of here.
All right, everybody else,
we're moving out.
Except you!
You're going in there.
Ah, ah!
Around.
I'm not interested in playing any more of your head games.
Get in.
Close the door.
Get back!
Terrific.
Where are you?
The head.
Graham barricaded me in here.
You're in a bathroom?
I could've gotten locked into a bathroom.
It's a long story.
Okay, I'm calling SWAT.
No, you won't call SWAT. I'll find a way out of here.
Just tell me, what do you got?
Okay.
Graham's psychiatrist said
that he's been experiencing blackouts,
which means that he may have killed his wife
without even realizing it.
No, it doesn't make sense.
How does that not make sense?
How does that not make sense to you?
I mean, the guy fled the crime scene
with the murder weapon in his hand.
Huh? I mean, I am no detective--
Wait a minute. Where am I?
Oh, I'm a detective!
He is still our prime suspect!
Graham identified me as a threat,
and he didn't do anything, okay?
He could have killed me, but he didn't.
Okay, all right, listen.
I know this guy is a SEAL, all right?
And brothers-in-arms, the whole thing-- I get that.
All right, but that does not mean he didn't kill his wife.
You're right.
You're right,
but I promised him that we would investigate this murder.
What do you think I'm doing?
I am investigating.
Unfortunately, he is our only suspect.
In my experience, when you only have one suspect,
he's usually the one that you put in jail!
Okay, you want me to broaden the search, fine,
but you're gonna have to give me something else.
As a matter of fact, I actually might have a new lead.
Graham said that Noreen was a Russian citizen,
they moved here six years ago.
All right, that'll explain why she has no record prior to '04.
Right.
And she changed her identity before they came here.
Her first name is Irina. So dig deeper.
You know what? Maybe that manuscript you found can help.
Okay, well, I already sent that over
to your friend Catherine in Intelligence,
and she said we'll have a translation back in an hour.
Oh, and the key-- I got a match
to a safe deposit box, First Hawaiian Bank.
They're sending the contents over right now.
What was that? What the hell was that?
Danny, I'll call you back.
I figured you'd want your things back.
How'd you get past Graham without him seeing you?
Well, I know things about this ship that aren't on your map.
I thought I told you to stay put.
Hmm? I'm an old man.
I don't always hear so good.
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
I'm a hostage!
He let me go!
I need help!
You get him,
I keep the SEAL.
And nobody else is leaving until
you find out who killed Noreen.
Let me speak with McGarrett.
All you need to know is that he's still alive.
And I'm watching you.
You got less than two hours.
And if you pull another stunt like that,
the next hostage comes out in a body bag.
You had that fellow's knife and you were standing
right next to him and you didn't take him out?
There's a way to do this where nobody has to die.
Besides, this is evidence.
Look at the dried blood on this knife.
There's a fingerprint in there.
I think it was put there at the time of the murder.
Watch this.
This could be what clears him.
You really think he's innocent, don't you?
My team's motto is "leave no man behind."
Now we just need to find him.
Where do you think he took the hostages?
He's gonna need another place with a good view of the gangway.
I think the best place would be the pilothouse.
Well, I know a shortcut.
Lead the way.
Took me a while,
but I swore that I knew the name Steve McGarrett.
Your grandfather was in the Navy, wasn't he?
Yes, sir. Stationed here at Pearl.
Yeah.
I remember.
Wait a minute.
Tough son of a gun.
You served with my grandfather?
On the Arizona.
You were one of the lucky ones.
It wasn't luck.
I wasn't onboard that day.
I lied about my age to enlist, you know.
I was 16 at the time.
They found out, but the officers liked me,
and they kept me around as a runner.
So that's what I was doing
December 7, 1941.
Running messages to the Army at Fort Shafter across the harbor.
I could see those explosions.
Those men I admired so greatly.
Oh, they gave their lives for all of us.
And I couldn't do a damn thing for them.
I walk past that Arizona memorial every day,
and I am reminded of their sacrifice.
The man that you are named after was a real hero.
You should be very proud.
I am proud.
Come on. Let's go.
What are you drawing?
Me, Mommy and Daddy.
What are you drawing?
This is me, surfing this morning.
Can you draw what you were doing this morning?
Okay.
What is that?
It's my hiding place.
For when there's too much yelling.
You hide under the couch?
Sometimes.
Are those Daddy's shoes?
No.
Whose shoes are they?
Hey, you don't have to be afraid.
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
You can tell me.
That's the man that yelled at Mommy.
Was Daddy there when they were yelling?
Okay, Lily, this is really important.
Who was that man?
And what was he saying to Mommy?
I can't talk funny like him and Mommy did.
But they yelled.
A lot.
Then Mommy got hurt.
Hey, do you want to, do you want to see where I work?
Lily, who is that?
Who is that man?
Excuse me. Sir.
Excuse me. Sir. Sir.
Lily! Lily! Lily!
Stop!
I only took my eyes off Lily, like, for a second.
They were targeting her.
We didn't know that.
There was nothing you could've done to prevent it.
So I got an APB out on the vehicle.
Uh, HPD's setting up checkpoints.
We got no plates, but Kono got eyes on the abductors.
She okay?
No, I don't think so.
Did you get any hits on those fingerprints I sent you?
Yeah. Um, I got a second set on the knife,
and they definitely don't belong to Graham.
And they don't belong to Noreen, either.
But, uh, they're not showing up in any HPD database,
so I'm expanding the search nationally.
Great, so, uh, we've got abductors,
we've got a witness that puts another man
in the house at the time of the murder,
and we got somebody else's prints on the blade.
You know what, Danny? This is really starting to look like...
Graham didn't do it. I know.
But it's not over yet.
We need to find a match on that print, Danny.
You need to end this hostage situation.
And whatever you do, please,
under no circumstance
tell this guy about his daughter.
He should know.
No, no. He shouldn't know. He shouldn't know.
Trust me-- as a father, the last thing you want
to hear about is that something happened to your kid.
And you add that to his irrational state of mind,
things are only going to get worse.
Copy that.
Don't, uh...
don't get soft on this guy, partner, all right?
Not until we have absolute proof that he didn't kill his wife.
And if he did, and it comes down to it,
you going to be able to take this guy out?
It's not going to come to that.
Quiet!
Graham, it's McGarrett.
We need to talk.
I should have figured you'd get out.
Listen, I believe you.
I don't think you killed your wife.
Okay?
And with a little more time,
my team is going to be able to prove that, Graham.
How?
Let's free those people, so we can talk.
You're lying!
I need my pack.
This has been going on too long.
I'm going to end it now.
We found Noreen's passport
in her safe deposit box.
She was born Irina Tarasova
in St. Petersburg, Russia, 1979.
Catherine also just sent over the translation.
The manuscript you found at the house--
it was Noreen's journal.
Uh, most of it's about her life in Russia.
She was married to, uh, a banker,
and it sounded like it was pretty brutal.
Multiple accounts of domestic violence.
We got an I.D. on him, too.
Yegor Chubais.
Vice president of Donvaya Bank in Switzerland.
He filed a report saying his wife
and newborn child went missing on a trip abroad.
That's him.
That's who?
That's the guy that kidnapped Lily.
Chubais came into Hawaii three days ago.
He's chartered a plane to Moscow.
It leaves in an hour.
He's trying to flee with Lily.
That's why he comes to Hawaii.
She starts a new life to get away from him.
Somehow, he finds out where she is.
And when Noreen wouldn't come with him...
Son of a bitch kills the mother of his own daughter.
Can't let them get on that plane. Come on.
Okay, come on, everybody!
Let's get moving! Come on!
Don't you move.
McGarrett's not answering.
Try him again.
Don't answer.
This could be the news that proves your innocence.
Graham, let me take the call.
Put it on speaker.
No tricks.
Finally. There you are. Go ahead.
Danny, we're on speaker with Graham.
Tell me you got the guy who did this.
Not exactly.
Uh, but we got a name and location.
We're on our way right now.
Who is it?
His name is Yegor Chubais.
Lily's father.
That's impossible.
He's dead.
We I.D.'d him coming into Honolulu Airport three days ago.
Yegor's dead.
Noreen told me that he had died of cancer.
Why would she lie to me?
I don't know, Graham.
I don't know.
Maybe she was trying to protect you
from a past that she's ashamed of.
But if my team says that this is the guy,
this is the guy.
You're lying.
McGarrett.
Steve.
On your knees.
Graham.
Get on your knees.
Hands behind your head.
This is McGarrett. Talk.
Sergeant.
Deploy your men.
Yes, ma'am.
That's them.
All right, hold on.
Hands up.
Get down! Down on the ground!
Arms out. Make a "T."
Get down!
On the ground, face down.
On the ground.
Palms up.
Cross your legs.
Go ahead.
You're safe now, okay?
Let me take you in.
Graham, we can still work this out.
We argued,
and I went for a walk.
Yeah, two laps around the block.
We got the guy, Graham. You heard them.
It was Yegor.
What if I didn't take that walk at all?
What if I really killed Noreen?
You didn't kill her, Graham.
Yegor did it.
Yegor killed her. This is over.
You hear me? This is over, Graham.
No! No!
McGarrett, get back.
Freeze. Put your weapon down slowly
and get on the ground.
Now, Graham.
Drop your weapon.
Drop your weapon now!
Cease fire. Cease fire.
You okay?
Getting shot hurts.
What were you thinking?
Leave no man behind.
Is that right?
Well, you're crazier than I thought.
Come on.
Hey. Hold up.
Give him a minute with his daughter, will you?
No cuffs.
Go ahead.
Look who that is.
Daddy!
Daddy, can we go home now?
Not yet, baby.
All right?
Auntie Susan is going to watch you for a little while.
Okay?
Daddy's... he's a little bit sick.
