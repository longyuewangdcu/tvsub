No, he's a musician too. Classical.
Well, maybe you're just a little too buttoned up.
Dude, you gotta come jam with us sometime.
Just think about it.
Yeah, I know who you are.
You're Robert Quinn.
As soon as I saw you I knew.
You're my daughter. I brought you this.
Just read it when you have the time.
Dear Callie, My name is Sophia.
I'm your sister. I would really, really like to meet you.
and I hope you wanna meet me too.
I'm sorry. You were way better than her.
She only made the team because she's Latin.
They have to have diversity.
No, I like how independent you are.
I just feel like sometimes
it's kinda like you're dating yourself.
Like it doesn't even matter whether I'm here or not.
Well, congrats. It doesn't anymore.
Emma, Emma.
I know it's not true,
but my dad won't let me sleep over at your house
because he thinks you're gay.
Oh, I've got some people
coming over to play in the garage again tonight.
Is that still cool?
Yeah, of course. How's it going?
Good. We're still trying to find our rhythm.
What's the matter?
Nothing. The girls on the dance team.
They keep posted pics of them hanging out together without me.
How come they didn't invite me?
Maybe because you're E-stalking them?
I am not!
Mariana, please...
would you please help your siblings here?
When do we get to hear something?
Uh... I don't think inviting my moms to band practice
is the best idea this early in the creative process,
but I'll let you know when the single drops?
I see. You know what? He doesn't think that we are cool enough.
I will have you know that your mother
and I used to listen to rock and roll all the time.
Oh yeah? Like who?
Like Springsteen and REM and...
Right.
Bananarama.
I can't believe you just said that.
I'll have you know that I went to a Nirvana concert, once.
So, why'd you stop? Listening, I mean.
Just... Remember we used to have dance parties all the time?
I don't know. Guess we just... got busy.
So what's the deal with this weekend?
Are you guys still doing on your babymoon thing?
Actually, your Grandmother had a shuffle in her conference plans
and she's not gonna be able to come and stay with you guys.
Yeah, so, I think the babymoon's gonna have to wait.
What's a babymoon?
It's kind of like a honeymoon
only instead of going away after you get married,
you go away after you get pregnant.
Before the baby comes and there's
no more time for fun, or travel, or romance.
Um, I think you guys should go anyway.
We're old enough to stay alone for one night.
That's a very nice offer, sweetie, thank you.
But I don't think so.
You know, we could put Brandon and Callie in charge, honey.
We could... uh, I don't... um...
I don't know that...
Honey, we need this.
It's just for one night.
*Honey, drop the melodrama*
*Tonight and do something crazy*
*All right*
*Won't you come my way? Won't you come my way?*
*All I see is your face...*
What's going on? Lou, hold up.
Uh, nothing, I'm sorry.
I wonder if Lou's coming on a little strong in the choruses.
I'm sorry?
Well, it's just that we're all in mezzo forte in that section,
and I was wondering if maybe you should just follow us?
Follow you?
Yeah,
I mean, you don't wanna give it all away from the top, right?
You gotta start with some pianos...
Pianos?
Yeah. Piano means softly, plain.
Gee, my favorite kind of rock and roll, soft and plain.
Maybe he has a point, Lou.
Yeah, and maybe I know how to sing my songs. In my band.
OK, fine.
Tomorrow night's open mic at Groundspace.
I will put the word out to a few friends,
and we can let them weigh in.
I actually can't do tomorrow night,
my moms are out of town and I'm kind of in charge.
OK, so we'll just do it here.
Well, I can't just have people over.
Shocker.
OK, yeah, sure. But only a few people.
You're the one in charge.
One, two, three, four...
Hey, wait up.
Where you been? I was looking for you at lunch.
Is this about what my dad said?
Because, you know, I don't care if you're... you know.
If that's what you are.
Are you?
What, gay? You can say it,
it's not a bad word.
But why do I have to be anything?
What do you mean?
Why does everybody go around
labeling people all the time, putting us in boxes?
I don't get it.
No, you're right. I'm sorry.
I won't do that anymore.
And what about your dad? He doesn't want us hanging out, right?
He doesn't have to know.
Yeah...
I don't want to be anybody's secret.
Tell your dad I said it was nice knowing ya.
演唱者 Unwed Teenage Mothers
Hey. You gonna be home tonight?
Unfortunately, yes.
Um, OK. It should be fun though.
What should?
Your brother's having people over, to hear the band.
He didn't tell you?
No. Wait, we're having a party?!
No, just a few people over,
listening to music. Low key.
Got it. Right. Cool.
OK, so, see you tonight?
Is this you? Cute.
That's my half-sister.
Wait, what?
Her name's Sophia.
She is fourteen and she wants to meet me.
Holy hell...
What did Jude think?
Haven't told him.
I don't know how he's gonna... take it.
What about Stef and Lena?
You tell them? Not yet.
Well, how about I take your mind off of it tonight?
You're sweet, um... I can't.
I have to be home, like, right after school.
Stef and Lena are going away for the night,
so they left me and Brandon in charge.
Can I come over?
No guests allowed. I'm sorry.
Hey girls, change of plans,
party at Mariana's tonight!
Awesome!
Uh... sorry.
Where'd you hear that Mariana was throwing a party?
From her.
Let the babymoon begin.
What?
Uh, I don't know. Just seems a little small, don't you think?
Doesn't feel a little claustrophobic to you?
We should've asked for the upgrade.
How much room do we need?
All right, we should call the kids, I think.
Honey, you just called them from the car.
What...
The whole point of us being here is so we can unplug.
I'm unplugged, I'm unplugged.
No, no, no! Wait!
What?
Do you have any idea how expensive that is?!
Did you know that some hotels charge if you just open up the fridge.
Seriously?
How about I go to the grocery store that's just up the road
and I'll grab us some snacks and some water
I'm sure that Dana's gift didn't include incidentals
and we can't afford to splurge right now.
What?
I guess this wouldn't be the best time to tell you
about the couples massage I ordered?
That's... that's fine.
Sounds good. Can I get you anything in particular?
Stef.
It's fine. I want to. I want to.
It'll give me a chance to call the kids.
and I'll get the little crackery thingys that you love.
Just... I'll be back before you know it.
You just... you sit there and relax.
You told people we were having a party tonight?
Don't look at me... it was Brandon's idea.
What? Why would Brandon be telling people we're having a party?
OK, it's not a party. I'm just inviting a few people over
to, you know, hear the band practice.
No. You heard Moms. We're not supposed to have any people over.
Hey, all I did was invite the dance girls.
Who are inviting people, who are probably inviting people...
Well, that's not my fault.
I don't care who's fault it is,
but you both have to call them all and cancel.
No. Last I checked, I don't take orders from you.
Well, Stef and Lena left me in charge.
So...
No.
They left us both in charge.
Exactly, which is why we should both...
You know, it's our babymoon, too, you guys!
There's gonna be a baby.
Which means this is the
last time our moms are ever go away again.
Do you hear what I'm saying? Ever. Again.
Which means that this is our only chance to have a party.
We're having a party?
No!
Come on, you guys, seriously.
You guys wanna get in more trouble?
We only get in trouble if we get caught.
So, we don't get caught.
I'm not gonna have any part of this.
Stef and Lena said that
nobody comes inside the house except for us.
So, nobody is going to step inside this house.
OK. We'll have the party in the backyard then.
Fine. But if you get caught, that's on you.
Jude and I are gonna follow the rules, right?
Fine.
Ok.
Who're you calling?
Uh, Wyatt.
If we're going to be keeping people out of the house,
we're gonna need help.
Isn't that breaking the rules?
No, it's...
sometimes you gotta break the rules to keep them.
In that case, can I ask Maddie to come? You know, to help.
Yes, we're fine, Mom.
We actually just ordered some pizzas for dinner tonight.
So... Callie?
Oh, you know, she's, uh, holdin' down the fort.
So while everyone's throwing down out there,
we're just gonna hole up in here?
Yep. That's the plan.
Gotcha. But if I were to step outside, you know,
for a little bit, that would be...?
Not cool. You're only here because you're my bouncer.
Security. Yeah, I didn't call you over so you could have fun.
Yeah. No risk in that.
Look, I'm not taking any chances, OK?
Remember how destroyed
your house got after the foreclosure party?
Yeah, but that was kinda the point.
I feel like I just walked into the house that boring built.
You need something? Kinda busy.
Uh, what are people supposed to do when they need to use the bathroom?
Guess that's your problem, isn't it?
OK. So, people are just gonna
pee all over Moms' flowers, is that what you want?
No. What I want is to prevent this house... our house
from being, I don't know, vandalized.
Vandalized? Don't you think you're over-reacting a little bit?
People get drunk and things get destroyed, Brandon.
God, when did you become so anal?
When did you become such an ass?
OK, um... a suggestion.
What if you let people use the bathroom just off the kitchen?
I'm just trying to help.
OK. But one at a time.
And we are going to monitor it all night.
We are?
Mm-hmm.
It was your idea. Or are we not trying to help anymore?
Fine. If that's how you guys want to spend your night.
Sounds like a plan.
What?
I've never seen you two act like that before.
Like what?
Brother and sister.
Thanks for letting Chelsea come.
My parents wouldn't let me come alone.
Can I see your dog? I love dogs.
Oh. Um, we don't have a dog.
Callie thinks it'll keep people out of our moms' bedroom,
just in case they get inside the house.
So... is Connor coming?
No. He's at his dad's for the weekend. Why?
Do you like him?
I don't.
Shut up!
It's not like I'm the only one
with a crush on someone in our class...
Oh, my God. I'm gonna kill you. Come on.
So, where you from?
Serbia.
Ahh. Nice.
How long have you been in this country?
Uh, about ten years.
Yeah? What made you come to America?
You have family here?
I did. But I came to start my own.
Wow, that's very brave of you. Do you have kids?
Yes, one. You?
Five.
This is the first night that they are staying home alone.
Wow. So is this a girl's getaway from your husbands, then?
Uh, actually, we're a couple.
Hence the couple's massage?
Nice.
Hey, ladies!
What's with all the signs? Are we not allowed in the house?
Oh. We just had the floors redone, actually.
So, no one can walk on them.
Besides, it's so nice out.
It's kinda chilly, actually.
Are there, like, outdoor heaters or anything?
No. But some of the seniors did bring beer.
So listen, Hayley's douche of a boyfriend dumped her this afternoon,
so she's super vulnerable right now.
Oh, my God, that's terrible.
Is there anything I can do?
No. We just need to keep an eye on her.
Make sure she doesn't drink too much.
We can't have her breaking the code of excellence tonight.
The code of what?
Right, I forgot.
Since we haven't really hung out socially before,
you should know, we have a few rules.
Ok...
We all stick to a one drink maximum.
We don't dress like sluts. We don't hook up with randoms.
And if there's dancing, we don't use any of our patent moves,
those are exclusive to the team.
And if anybody breaks the code, they're kicked off.
But thanks for having us over!
Hey, uh, where is she?
You don't think she'd, like, bail on us, do you?
Nah, it's just Lou... This is how she rolls. She'll be here.
Hey, man. Can I have a sip?
What the...?
What's wrong with you?!
Get outta here. Go.
Yeah, toilet won't flush.
Great. And thank you for telling us that after you used it.
You're welcome!
Well, don't let anyone in. I'm gonna go get a plunger.
Hey. Is Jude here?
Um, upstairs. Hurry. Hurry!
See, this is why I didn't want anyone using the bathroom.
Nope.
I take it back, that is why.
OK, that brings the count to two hand-holds,
three kisses, one butt-grab,
and one "so deep it looked like he was gonna eat her head" make out.
OK, I'm bored. This is worse than when my dad watches golf.
Oh. I don't know... That ping pong game looked kinda funny.
Well, maybe we should play a game, too.
I could be into that.
Oh, uh, OK. I'll go check the game closet?
What about... Spin the bottle?
Um... We don't have a bottle.
There's an app for that.
Well, there are only three of us.
What are you...?
I told my dad I wanted to come over.
And he said it was OK?
I didn't ask him if it was OK.
So, you guys are having a party?
We are... Now that there are four of us.
Sorry. I didn't see anyone was in here.
Have you seen a cooler anywhere?
Hey, are you OK?
My boyfriend and I broke up.
Seriously? That sucks.
For what it's worth
my girlfriend just broke up with me too, so...
I get it.
Emma?
Well, that was dumb of her.
You're hot.
I could say the same about you.
So, why did this idiot break up with you?
He said it's because I was too needy.
But, honestly?
I think it's just because he wanted to hook up with older girls.
He's in college.
What about you?
Well, we weren't really a good match. So...
I probably look like such a mess right now.
Is my mascara running?
A little.
Will you get it?
Here.
Uh, toilet's out of order.
What about our bathroom?
No. No one goes upstairs.
What about if I like just pee in the kitchen sink?
I mean... Sure?
All right, fine. Five minutes but just her, OK? No one else.
Hey! No, no, no. Take it outside!
OK, so you have to kiss whoever the bottle points to.
Those are the rules. Maddie, you're first.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
OK, who's next! Jude?
Um, sure, just...gimme two secs?
Oh! Sorry, I didn't know anyone was in here.
It's OK. You gotta go? It's all yours.
What's...going on?
I don't think your friend's feeling very well.
Hey! Off the swing!
It's not a playground!
Where's Kaitlyn?
Um... She already came down.
You didn't see her?
No.
Hmm. That's weird.
Wait here.
I like this ride!
Yeah, well, ride's over.
Come on, we gotta go downstairs.
Aw, you're no fun.
Yep. Been hearing that all night. Come on.
Let's go.
OK.
Wait.
What?
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, they've got lesbian porn.
How does Breakfast On Tiffany sound?
That sounds horrifying.
Oh, come on, it'll help get us in the mood.
Please. No bigger turn off
than two straight girls in stilettos pretending for men,
that they're hot for each other.
Give me a break.
OK.
So how was your massage? Was it good?
It was pretty good.
Yeah? Cool.
How about you, how was your interview with Inka?
My what?
You seemed more interested in her life story
than anything I've had to say lately.
I was just making conversation.
During a couples massage?
Yeah, well, as soon as she heard we were
a couple'a lesbians that shut her up, didn't it?
Where are you going?
I'm gonna take a bath.
I'm so sorry. I had no idea how drunk she was.
Just tell her friends that she came with to take her home.
I can't do that. None of the girls on the dance team
can see her like this, she can get kicked off the team.
Why?
Because of the code.
Code?
Yeah, the code. You're not allowed...
Actually, I don't care. Just tell Wyatt to take her home.
OK, come on.
I'm looking for my son, Connor.
Are Jude's parents even here?
Oh yeah, yeah. They're... they're out back.
Well, is Connor here?
You know, I don't know.
Well, you mind letting me go take a look around?
What's happening?
Stay.
Connor's dad is here!
Wait, why would Connor's dad be here?
Connor's not here.
OK, Connor, your turn.
We don't have to kiss, do we?
Well, those are the rules.
Fine.
No, this is dumb.
We should stop.
No, it's cool.
Let's just do it.
Connor, your dad's here!
Oh, my God, he cannot find me here.
Why not?
I snuck out.
I've actually only been up here a couple of times,
so I can't...
Where's Connor?
I don't know.
I thought he wasn't allowed to come over.
I'm just hanging with my girls.
Hey, where have you been? This was your idea.
And in case you've forgotten, I'm risking my ass to do this.
Cool it, Beethoven. We'll start in a minute.
Contrary to what you might think,
you're not talented enough to make people wait.
Really?
Well, contrary to what you might think,
you're not a member of this band
and we don't need you or your big fat classical ego.
Well, then why are we even doing this?
You know what, we're not. Peace.
OK. You need to get everybody out of the house now.
How am I supposed to do that, Callie?
I can't just...
Play.
OK. That's why they're all here, isn't it?
So if you start playing they will come outside and listen.
Well, Lou just bailed, so I...
So play without her, OK? But play something,
or I swear I'll call the police and shut this party down myself!
Mind if I join you?
Listen, I thought about what you said and...
you're right.
We should watch Breakfast On Tiffany.
You know what, I think...
we should just go home.
All right, what's wrong?
We need to connect.
I am trying.
No, you're not.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to talk to me.
About something other than money or the kids.
Why don't you talk to me?
Because half the time I really don't think you're listening.
So, when I don't talk, it's my fault.
And when you don't talk it's my fault, too.
I get it. It's all on me.
I'm the one failing in this relationship.
I didn't say that.
Well, that's how it feels.
OK, back downstairs. Now!
Go.
All right.
Come on, let's go.
Whatever. We'll party down...
Yeah.
Hey, I thought you left.
That's what Brandon said anyway.
Brandon.
He always been such a pompous ass?
You know, he acts like he's doing us some big frickin' favor.
Guess all these...
ribbons and trophies have really gone to his head?
Brandon's not pompous.
So he's just an ass?
You know, to be honest, I'm surprised this didn't go to his head.
He was brilliant. Like, really, majorly brilliant.
He even got into the junior symphony.
Was brilliant?
Yeah, he... got beaten up.
His hand was shattered and he lost all this.
He'll never play classical piano again,
not like he used to.
Brandon's not doing you a favor. You're doing him one.
Hey, has anyone seen Kaitlyn?
Anyone?
Sing something already!
Dude, do you sing?
I do, but...
unless you want, like, a sonata, I kinda only know one song.
Play it, we'll follow.

Yeah, they are.
Wait, wait a second.
Everything OK?
Oh yeah, I just...
Gotta condom?
I'll be right back.
You know, it's not all on you, OK?
It's on me, too.
When we got married, that night and the next morning
I felt like we were
we were more in love than ever.
Like we were just zipped up in the same skin.
I have never felt so happy,
so close to you.
I want that feeling back.
I want us back.
I know that we can't always be as connected
as we were on our wedding night.
But you can't blame me for wishing that we could,
and for missing you.
I miss you too.
And I'm sorry.
I get so stressed and worried about everything
that I forget
how important it is for us to take care of each other.
And I know we make these promises all the time,
but I'm gonna do better. OK? I'm gonna do better.
It's Jesus.
Hi baby, is everything OK?
You OK?
Yeah, I just...
I've never done anything like this before.
I know people say that, but I actually mean it.
I haven't either.
You're only the second guy I've been with.
You're my second, too.
Girl. I haven't been with any guys.
So, can I call you?
Can I have your number?
I'd like that.
Hey, that was...
No need to gloat. You were right.
Dude, we have a serious problem.
I just butt-dialed Mama
and she called me back and left a message.
What should I do?
Um, Moms are calling me.
What do I do? What do I do?!
You guys, Lena is calling me.
Answer it, now!
Shut up!
Hey, what's up?
Nope, everyone's fine, why?
Oh, really? Um...
Well, we were just watching some
dumb action movie with the volume all the way up, so...
maybe that's why nobody heard your calls.
Yeah, no, everyone's here.
Hey.
Hey, Moms!
Hi, Moms!
Where's Jude?
Uh, Jude? Jude is... in the bathroom
he'll be right back.
What were you guys watching?
It wasn't some violent shoot 'em up, was it?
No, no. It was um, it was just...
The Fast And The Furious: 2 Fast 2 Furious.
Hi, Moms. Sorry, I was playing video games...
In the bathroom. On Callie's phone.
I thought we were talking on Callie's phone?
That's my phone, Jude! Geez. Ask next time!
All right, don't go to bed too late, you guys.
We won't.
Good night. Love you.
Good night.
You think they bought it?
They better have.
Don't go thanking me all at once, or anything.
Well, at least nothing horrible happened...
so can we just get everyone out of here, please?
Yep. You got it.
Yeah, ten bucks says they're having a party.
Oh, no, so now we're just throwing money away?
I'm serious. Yeah, OK. What do you think?
I think they said everyone was fine, so, everyone is fine.
Fine.
But you probably want to go home anyway?
So we can just pack up...
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, look, they are obviously still alive, right?
And if they're having a party,
we will certainly find out about it soon enough.
In the meantime, why don't we have one of our own?
演唱者 Korby Lenker
Kick off our shoes. Oh, oh. Just like that.
And we'll dance... What?
Our son basically signed us up for AARP this morning.
So we can either roll with it, or we can dance.
Come on.
So? Was it "excellent," like you wanted?
Meh... not really.
I spent the whole night cleaning up after everyone.
I felt like such a mom.
The dance girls?
Yeah. I just... I don't get it.
Kaitlyn made this huge deal about all these rules they had.
And then no one seemed to care
when they basically broke every single one of them.
And if I hadn't been babysitting them the whole night,
I could've actually had a good time.
Maybe I could've broken a rule or two myself.
That's a bad idea.
Their rules, whatever they are,
they still apply to you, because of who you are.
Why, because I'm Latina?
No, because you're not like those girls,
and you never will be.
Don't you know that?
So Connor snuck out, huh?
Well, his dad seemed pretty mad.
Um. Yeah, his... dad doesn't really like me.
Why not?
What are we gonna tell Moms?
Um, maybe a bird flew through the window?
What, like a pterodactyl?
No, they're gonna know that we had a party.
I could fix it.
I worked last summer in construction.
Plating a window's not that hard.
All we gotta do is get the glass first-thing in the morning.
Then I can just pop it in and glaze it.
Glaze it?
I'm not just a bouncer, you know.
How can I help?
You got a broom and dustpan?
So... Listen, I'm sorry you had to be, like, the Gestapo tonight.
I never should have...
Sucks being the responsible one.
Yeah. Tell me about it.
It was worth it, though.
Getting to hear you play again.
That first song.
I know that's, like, ours.
The only reason I played it was because...
Because it's good.
And you knew they'd love it. And they did.
You don't have to say that.
I know. Brandon, you're really good.
And, with you, that band could really be something.
