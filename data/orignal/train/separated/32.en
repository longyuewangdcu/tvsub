The transmitter is to be worn around your ankle at all times.
You're confined to the apartment 24 hours a day.
It must not cross this line.
Your condition is your defense.
There is no condition!
I'll be damned if I'm going to have people think
that Jonas Stern is losing his mind.
You've done wrong.
I know I have.
Your marriage is in trouble
because you don't acknowledge true repentance.
Tell me what I have to do.
I'm going to take a third of your business,
and then I'm coming back for the rest.
At 5:16 p.m. on September 5, the explosion hit.
It was felt over four blocks away.
Federal investigators determined it was a pipe bomb
consisting of ammonium nitrate and anhydrous hydrazine nitrate,
which had been thrown through the window of the newsroom layout office.
No culprits were ever apprehended,
And the federal government continues to investigate.
The explosion killed the plaintiff
Mr. Jeffrey Sanborn, 42,
managing editor of the Cook County Vindicator"
Exception.
Resulted in his death.
Uh, noted and accepted.
Replacing "Killed."
Mr. Sanborn is married
And has two teenaged dependents who will suffer
from loss of wages and affection.
Mr. Clay and the Cook County Vindicator,
jointly and severally, agree to pay... Uh, Julius?
$250,000 from capped business insurance
and $100,000 from capped renter's insurance
But only if we agree now.
We agree.
Mrs. Sanborn?
Mrs. Sanborn?
The man you're discussing--
my husband--
he was working on a novel.
I just started reading it.
It's... beautiful.
And you're telling me
that he's worth $350,000?
Mrs. Sanborn, no money could ever replace your husband,
but the only way we can talk here is about money.
I'm sorry.
I've been reading a lot of books about grief,
and they all suggest waiting six months
before you make any big changes in your life.
Well, Jeffrey died exactly six months ago this week, so...
you're fired...
and you are, too.
Mrs. Sanborn, if you do this, we have to start over,
and you may not get a better settlement from our client.
I think I will.
Why?
Why do you think that?
Because I just hired a new lawyer.
Jeanette!
Oh, how I missed you, baby doll.
Ah, good to see you.
Hey, get out of this hellhole, come work for a real law firm.
I have arrived.
Mr. Stern, thank you for joining us.
Mrs. Sanborn, it is an extreme and unconditional pleasure.
Hello, Julius.
I see you haven't taken down the "S" yet.
We're looking for a new Stern.
Coffee, two sugars.
Thanks.
How about you three? Anybody want coffee?
Ah, it'll just be one coffee.
How are you feeling, Mr. Stern?
How am I feeling, huh?
Well, I'm feeling like amending a complaint.
How does that sound?
Jonas,
the insurance has been capped at $350,000.
The newspaper can't pay any more.
Unless it was an intentional act.
Intentional act opens you up to punitive damages.
I love when she talks like that.
It sounds so good coming from a young person.
How is it an intentional act?
Your client published an editorial cartoon which depicts
the Prophet Muhammad being humiliated.
Being body scanned at an airport metal detector.
And while all the other white passengers are waved through.
It was intended to criticize racial profiling.
All the while, your client knew
that Islam prohibits any pictorial depiction of the Prophet,
and he cut back on security
at the exact moment he should have increased it.
A cost-cutting measure.
Read the settlement, Jonas.
You know what happened in Denmark
when the Morning Post published cartoons just like this.
Riots, death threats.
This isn't about Mrs. Sanborn, Jonas.
This is about us.
Of course it's about us.
I'm going to destroy your firm.
And Mrs. Sanborn understands that, don't you, dear?
I do.
How much are you suing for?
Didn't I ask for coffee?
How much in punitive?
$25 million.
Here's the amended suit.
Mrs. Florrick.
May I have a moment?
How am I feeling?
It was an innocent question.
Attorney-client privilege.
What you know about me,
what you know about my condition
is for us to know and no one else.
You do understand that?
Oh, there it is again.
That poker face.
You know, I always thought the CIA could learn something
from the suburban housewife. Do you understand?
I understand the obligations of my job.
Good.
Oh, has your friend Will Gardner stabbed you in the back yet?
Would you like me to get him on the phone for you? You can ask.
Ask him who he's meeting with right now.
Or does the name Gerald Kozko mean anything to you?
He's a real estate developer.
Underwater,
and unless I'm mistaken, his name keeps coming up
in connection with your husband's case.
Always a pleasure, Mrs. Florrick.
Well, it's never about the money.
It's always about something else.
Well, I'm sorry we can't help.
Take care.
Mrs. Florrick.
Mister...?
Kozko, Gerald.
We've never met.
How's Peter?
Fine.
I didn't know you knew Will.
I don't, I was shopping for more lawyers to join my defense team,
but it appears we have a conflict of interest--
you.
Anyway, glad to meet you.
Peter always said he was a lucky guy.
Now I see why.
Would you tell Peter something for me?
Tell him I'm sorry.
For?
He'll know what I mean.
My great grandfater Lucius Clay founded the Vindicator.
In his first editorial he endorsed Abraham Lincoln.
In his last he railed against Prohibition.
The Trib and the Sun-Times may be bigger,
but they have to answer to corporate ownership.
Dumbwaiters.
Lucius set them up to shuttle in the booze.
And so we gladly admit that
we have committed this attack upon the blasphemous,
who published this cartoon,
to defend the honor of all Muslims and of Allah's beloved prophet.
Peace be upon him.
Yes, I've seen this.
How does it hurt us?
The plaintiff says it's no secret this group's been active in Chicago.
Six months earlier,
they committed an identical bombing at a synagogue.
And you had to know that cartoon might provoke them.
My job is to provoke.
Because it sells papers?
Because freedom of the press is meaningless
unless somebody actually uses it.
I'm not trying to be insensitive.
Jeff Sanborn was a very good friend.
We came up together.
The problem, Mr. Clay, is their argument is,
you did it to increase circulation.
It's not like I commissioned this cartoon,
hoping it was going to anger Muslims.
We had an online contest--
best political cartoon, any subject.
And you picked the cartoon?
In consultation with my editors.
Jeffrey Sanborn, too?
Sure, of course.
So, even if Stern can show he intended this to happen,
Sanborn was contributorily negligent.
Might not be a total win,
but it's enough to get us back to the table.
We'll need something more than Mr. Clay's testimony to establish it.
What about the cartoonist?
It was an anonymous submission.
I sent the money to a PayPal account.
Routed through a proxy.
There's no way to trace it.
We'll see. I'll get Kalinda on it.
Returning to the scene of the crime?
You're not going to pout, are you?
I hate when men pout.
Go away.
Okay, let's inspect the level of coincidence here.
I haven't seen you since college.
We bump into each other here.
You ask me what I'm doing.
I talk about the Muhammad cartoon case,
and then the next day-- lo and behold--
you and your firm are suing my client.
Cary, think about it.
If I let slip a piece of information like that to you,
you'd be on the phone to your boss before our second drink.
Okay.
Then your turn.
What's going on at work?
Okay, I'll play.
Stern wants you.
Stern wants me?
Last night you wanted me, now he wants me.
Lockhart, Gardner is going under.
It's a hollowed-out shell.
Because Stern keeps taking our clients.
In one year,
your firm will be nothing but an empty floor in an office building.
Stern's got equity, plenty of business,
and one more thing, no contest.
That's right, your little contest with Mrs. Florrick.
You're losing.
I got more billable hours.
And Florrick's got a name.
Stern is new.
There's a better path to partnership.
Think about it.
You won't be alone.
Oh, I won't be alone?
In leaving Lockhart, Gardner.
You're raiding us?
Mm-hmm.
So where are we on getting me to church?
I'm filing a religious exception to electronic monitoring.
It doesn't always work, but we'll hope for the best.
Maybe next Sunday.
And I am getting a photographer at the church.
I don't care what the good pastor has to say.
Eli, we're not doing that.
What is it? What's the mater?
Well, it's... probably nothing.
Um, Childs is changing the direction with the retrial.
He's giving up the sex angle.
That's all he's got.
Is he changing the trial date?
No. Two months away.
I don't understand, then.
I am hearing chatter about a surprise witness.
So who can hurt you?
Well, if they're going to lie,
anybody can hurt me.
Maybe Childs is trying to quietly make this disappear.
I doubt it.
Hey, hon.
Gerald Kozko was at my office today.
He wanted me to tell you something.
He said, "Tell Peter I'm sorry"
Damn.
No. Kozko and Childs hate each other.
There's no way he's going to grant him immunity.
Well, he would if it's the only way to get Peter.
We need...
You're standing in my kitchen.
Whatever you have to say, you can say it in front of me.
You heard her.
Mrs. Sanborn,
did your husband have a close relationship with his employer?
Mr. Clay?
Yes. Until recently.
It had become strained-- their friendship.
And why was that?
Objection. Beyond the scope.
Well, I really think we're safe here.
Don't you?
You may answer, Mrs. Sanborn.
The paper was in financial trouble.
They had to lay off a lot of staff.
The stress took its toll.
Jeff was also frustrated by Mr. Clay's pursuit
of a New Yorker cover.
Something controversial.
Like the Obama fist-bump cartoon on the New Yorker.
Something that would increase readership.
Well, Mrs. Sanborn, did your husband help
Mr. Clay choose the cartoon for publication in the paper?
Yes.
It was a contest, and he helped Mr. Clay judge it.
But the cartoon that appeared was different, wasn't it?
Yes.
I saw the original.
It didn't depict Muhammad.
It was just a Middle-Eastern man.
Jeffrey told me
that the decision to change it to Muhammad was Mr. Clay's.
To generate more controversy.
Is it just me,
or do we really need to find that cartoonist?
So, here's your cartoon.
Now, you see this cross-hatching?
How it almost looks like bars?
That can indicate a sense of suffocation.
Like they can't say what they mean.
In this case, it might indicate
someone who's a Muslim themselves.
Fascinating.
Yeah.
Does this really work?
Graphology?
Applied to drawing.
It does if you know what you're looking for.
You don't respect my job, do you?
I am... incredulous.
It's best with comparison.
You run an image search, cross-referenced
with the unique elements of the sample drawing.
Still too much.
Narrow it by location.
Chicago.
Better.
Looks like I am a believer.
The thing is, when you hired me,
I was told the firm had a program
for lending associates money against our salaries--
for down payments, cars.
Accounting turned you down?
Yeah.
And I got my eye on a condo in Lincoln Park.
Interest rates are still low.
Look, money's a little tight these days, that's all.
Yeah, I just want to know
if there's anything I should be aware of.
About my future.
About your...?
No.
Nobody's trying to tell you anything.
It's just money's tight.
So I'm still in the running?
You are.
Nobody's made any decisions yet.
Is that it?
Yes.
So how's Peter doing?
He's good. I mean, he'd be a lot better
if he had a clearer sense of what Childs was planning.
So, he got the message?
My apology?
Yeah.
Look, you and Peter go back a long way.
If Childs is threatening you,
Peter wants to help his friends in any way he can.
Well, I don't want to hurt Peter.
But it's not just me.
I have a legacy to protect.
My son.
Peter has a family, too.
We all have families.
Okay, let's cut the pleasantries.
Whatever you have,
or think you can devise, to hurt Peter--
he has twice as much to hurt you.
I know your reputation, Mr. Gold.
Then you know I don't screw around.
I know Peter has religion.
Meaning?
He's off his game.
You have a pastor giving him spiritual instruction.
Now he's going to church.
Hey, I'm in risk assessment, Mr. Gold.
At the moment, Childs is the bigger risk.
Did he give you immunity?
Oh, that's not good.
Not at all.
We don't threaten with a subpoena
unless he refuses to testify.
How about we don't threaten at all?
Yes?
Mrs. Bassir?
Dr. Bassir. May I help you?
Oh, so sorry. Yes, of course.
Um, is your husband home?
My husband?
My husband doesn't live in this country.
Is there a Tarik Bassir here?
A cartoonist?
Yeah, that's me.
What's up?
Yeah, it was my idea.
Some jerk at the airport gave me a hard time,
so I drew about it.
First I made it just a picture of a random Muslim.
Then I thought-- what the hell?
Language.
I mean, if I'm going to make a statement,
why not really make a statement, you know?
So it was your idea to depict...
The Prophet.
Yeah. Somebody has to do something or the Fundies win.
Fundamentalists.
I e-mailed Clay,
told him I wanted to change the cartoon.
Put it out in the open, get other Muslims
to reexamine their preconceptions.
Then why do it anonymously?
Hey, I'm 15 years old.
Why do I do anything?
You have to understand--
I knew nothing about any of this.
Not until after.
And would you be willing to testify about all of this, Tarik?
That's not up to Tarik.
Well, he could testify in camera--in the judge's chambers.
There would only be the judge, the lawyers, the court reporters.
We would use a pseudonym.
Mrs. Florrick, Miss Sharma,
I know the name of only one cartoonist.
Kurt Westergaard,
the man who drew one of the cartoons of Muhammad
in the Danish paper five years ago.
And he has been living
under 24-hour security since then.
I will not do that to my son.
You explained he could testify in camera?
Yes. She doesn't want to take a chance.
Well, if she doesn't produce him,
she'll be held in contempt.
No.
Uh, we need him.
He is the only one who can corroborate
the cartoon was his idea, not yours.
I already have Jeff Sanborn's blood on my hands.
I won't have this kid's.
This kid is all we have, Charles.
If we don't use him, we need an alternate story for the jury.
Counterterrorism unit just finished its preliminary bombing report.
Maybe there's something we overlooked.
Can you get your hands on it?
I can try.
If I leave Lockhart/Gardner,
I don't want it to be a dozen junior associates and me.
It won't be.
We've got an equity partner.
Ten associates.
You got an equity partner?
There's a lot of unhappiness at Lockhart/Gardner.
Which one?
I like your hair messy.
Don't comb it, okay?
Ten litigators, an unhappy equity partner.
It's Julius, isn't it?
He was always close to Stern.
You are a smart boy.
He tried to poach you?
Stern did?
Yes.
And 11 others.
Who?
The only name I know is Julius Cain.
I don't want you to think for one moment
I was considering taking it.
Of course not.
I'm a team player.
I just want to do what's right for the firm.
Thanks, Cary.
Yeah.
Oh. I'm working on your loan.
I think we can make it work.
Thanks.
I really appreciate that.
Yes, I was at the Vindicator
when Mr. Clay made the decision to publish the cartoon.
And did you argue against it?
I did.
I felt it was insensitive to Muslim believers,
especially when the same point could be made
without depicting Muhammad.
You also argued that it was reckless.
I was the reporter on the synagogue bombing.
I saw the devastation that caused.
Mr. Thiessen, were you present when Mr. Clay met
with the Vindicator lawyer prior to the publication of the cartoon?
Objection, Your Honor!
Attorney-client privilege.
Mr. Thiessen observed the conversation, Your Honor,
and is not covered by the privilege.
That makes sense to me.
Doesn't it, Ms. Lockhart?
I'll allow.
What was said at this meeting?
The lawyer referenced the New York Times
and Yale University Press decision not to reprint the Danish cartoon.
He believed, in both cases,
the fear of inciting violence trumped the public's need to know.
Thank you, sir.
Mr. Thiessen, you were worried
that the paper would be insensitive
to religious believers by printing the cartoon?
Yes.
I'm not a Muslim myself, but I can sympathize.
And what is this?
"Piss Christ."
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
"Piss... Christ."
Yes, an artwork depicting a crucifix
placed in a cup of urine.
This photo illustrated an article of yours
on controversial art?
My goodness.
Why not the same sensitivity to religious believers?
Because that is unlikely to incite violence.
So, it's not about sensitivity, it's about fear?
It's about both.
Mm-hmm. You were fired
from the Vindicator, weren't you, Mr. Thiessen,
as part of Mr. Clay's cost-cutting?
Yes. But that has nothing to do with my testimony.
Who are you?
The plumber. Who are you?
I'm Jackie.
That means nothing to me.
Peter's mother.
Oh, yes, of course.
Mrs. Florrick. I'm... I'm Eli Gold.
Please, come on in.
You're not the plumber.
No.
I'm Peter's, uh, image consultant.
Call me Eli.
I like that brooch.
Thank you. Where's my son?
He's just...
He's meeting with his pastor.
His...
Pastor.
But please go in.
I'm sure they'd love to say hello.
Yeah, it was good.
We had a guide and a porter.
And his sister was there.
They've been meeting once a week for prayer,
spiritual guidance...
and the sharing of Jesus Christ.
Who is that man?
Isaiah Easton,
pastor at Lord in Christ Church.
On 95th?
Yes.
Southside.
There is something in the FBI report.
The theory is that the bomb was tossed in through the window.
Just like the synagogue.
Yeah.
But all the windows were blown out by the force of the blast.
So?
So there's no way to tell if the bomb was tossed in or not.
That's the blast site.
You remember what Clay said?
Those dumbwaiters they used during Prohibition to haul the liquor up--
they're all over the place.
So, this is the access to the office dumbwaiter.
Well, the blast blew it apart.
It doesn't mean it went up this way.
What? What is it?
Kalinda, words.
The bomb was hydrogen nitrate,
a liquid explosive,
and it stains concrete, not tile.
How do you know that?
Looked it up.
Look.
The stain splattered here... not here.
Concrete, not tile.
Well, it could have come down the shaft from the blast.
Not in liquid form.
So, what are you saying,
someone mixed the bomb here
and raised it... on the dumbwaiter?
I'm not saying anything; I'm just staring at a stain.
But if the bomb was mixed here...
we're talking about an inside job.
The blast blew apart the wall with the dumbwaiter,
so there was no evidence that it was even there.
Should I bring Julius in on this?
No, not yet. We'll update him later.
I still don't understand how the Feds missed this.
Well, my guess is, they didn't.
Their investigation is still open.
They just didn't issue any of their findings.
And they won't until they catch whoever's responsible.
Cary. Come on in.
The question is, what does it mean?
Well, Stern's theory is that Clay wanted a violent backlash.
That rests on the fact that he cut back security.
Yeah, but if the bomb came from inside,
no security would've been able to prevent it.
Right.
Stern will still argue that the bomb was planted by a radical Islamic group.
They just had help from inside.
So talk to the employees.
That could help.
A lone bomber in the office.
How many Muslim employees does he have?
Can't be many.
So we're going to racially profile?
The exact thing the cartoon was against.
No. We're gonna step nicely past the ironies
and defend our client.
Go over the employees for the last five years.
Okay.
Shall we?
Julius, can we talk to you for a second?
What's that about?
It's a betrayal.
It's a business decision.
What happened to loyalty?
It exited the building the day you fired half of tax litigation.
Look...
I really didn't want it to get back to you this way,
but, uh, it's no secret this place
is going through financial troubles.
Half of which is Stern's fault, Julius.
There was trouble before Stern started to take clients.
Right now his firm seems more stable,
and I consider him a mentor.
So do I.
But at the end of the day, I bet on myself, not him.
With Stern, it's all about Stern.
I'm sorry.
Julius.
You're one of the best lawyers we have.
You have a great client list.
So what's it gonna take?
Here's my offer from Stern.
We can match it.
What about, uh, gearing up that diversity program we keep talking about?
That'll cost us money we don't have.
We lag behind virtually every other major Chicago firm
in diversity hiring.
I'm tired of being the poster boy for affirmative action around here.
Okay, fine.
We'll find the money.
All right.
Now, it's your turn to do something for us.
Ten other lawyers who were gonna go with you--...
...their names.
What, you want me to...
But now they'll stay.
Stern wanted me, not them.
We don't want turncoats with access to proprietary information.
You're gonna fire them.
It's more money for diversity hiring.
Write down the names.
What is that?
The results of my questioning the employees.
One received that the week before the attack.
Tell me they didn't take this to Clay.
They took it to Clay.
And he ignored it?
Yes.
Which makes it even worse that it was an inside job.
Clay isn't liable for unforeseeable acts of his employees.
But now? If he had prior notice?
If we know this, Stern knows this.
Oh, well, that's a happy thought.
That's me, Mr. Cheer.
Well, it makes Clay's questioning tomorrow that much more important.
Oh. Which brings up another problem.
Julius was handling questioning.
Why is that a problem?
Maybe Cary should take it.
No. Alicia.
She can get in Stern's face more effectively.
The fact is, you know something about Stern no one else knows.
I can't use it, Kalinda.
You can't not use it.
It violates attorney-client privilege.
Only if you tell someone, so don't tell someone.
All right, see you, then.
I want you to meet Bishop Grayson.
Mom.
He's a nice Episcopalian priest.
He will help you put this religion stuff into perspective.
It is in perspective.
That's not perspective.
This is about Alicia, isn't it?
No.
No, it's not. It's about me.
And I need a change.
No, you don't, Peter.
You are a good man.
You want to blame yourself.
But you apologized.
You apologized again, and again.
Anybody who wants another apology from you
only wants you to be weak.
So stop this.
Stop this now.
My son will not be made weak.
You are one scary mom.
Yes. And you are a good son.
Mrs. Sanborn stated under oath
that it was your decision to have the cartoon depict the Prophet Muhammad.
That's untrue.
The cartoonist contacted me with that idea.
Still, it was your decision to run the cartoon, Mr. Clay.
Why did you?
'Cause it was newsworthy.
It wasn't sensational.
And this is America--
we can handle it.
Thank you.
Mr. Clay,
what is The Naked Columnist?
An advice columnist in my paper
who supposedly answers questions in the nude.
And that is newsworthy.
That's not sensational.
It is not on the front page.
And this is America.
We can handle it.
The Naked... Columnist.
There's room for entertainment in every paper.
A lot of room, apparently.
You devoted 10,000 column inches to The Naked Columnist last year.
Do you know how many you devoted to Iraq?
I'm battling Internet competitors, sir.
Competitors who are willing to give away their product for free.
Mr. Clay, are you aware that the police now believe
that this bombing was an inside job?
Objection! Not in evidence.
Yes.
Your Honor, this is plaintiff's exhibit N--
the police report... filed... yesterday morning.
Mr. Clay, you don't know anything about this,
do you?
Objection! Argumentative.
Uh, Your Honor, it's a simple leading question.
Overruled.
Um, you may answer.
I'm sorry, wh-what was the question?
The question was, uh...
The police now believe that the bombing was an inside job,
that the bomb was hoisted up
through a dumbwaiter.
Objection! Again,
not in evidence.
It is in the investigative report.
The investigative report merely states
that it appears a bomb was planted from inside.
It doesn't say anything specifically about dumbwaiters.
We ask that statement be stricken from the record.
Is that really necessary, Mrs. Florrick?
Overruled.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Where was I?
Uh, right, right.
Dumbwaiter, employees.
So, Mr. Clay,
have any of the employees approached you about threats they might
have been receiv...?
Objection. Overly vague.
Mrs. Florrick.
You're right.
Withdrawn, Your Honor.
You may proceed, Mr. Stern.
Yes. Thank you, Your Honor.
Um... One moment.
Mr. Stern?
Yes. Just-just one moment, please. Thank you.
Inside job. The threat. A threat.
Mr. Stern.
The documents.
No, no.
Do you have any further questions for this witness?
Damn it, give me a minute!
I am sorry, Your Honor.
I... I just, uh...
I, um...
I have nothing further.
Thank you, Mr. Clay. You are dismissed.
Please refrain from speaking with the jury
and make yourself available for further questions.
At this time,
I suggest a, uh, a ten-minute recess.
You don't at all understand.
We're still treating this like jihad even though it's an inside job.
Because of the threat. The bomb?
Look.
You were talking about racial profiling, right?
What if someone was using our bias to make us think it was jihad
when it was really something else?
Okay.
I'm listening.
And...
That's all I got.
I didn't say I was solving something.
I just said I didn't understand.
I want credit for it.
Whatever you get, I want credit.
Hmm. Whatever.
Mr. Thiessen, you covered the bombing at the Oak Lawn synagogue?
That's right.
And it's your opinion that this bomb was very similar to that one?
Identical.
In both cases, the device was fashioned from a metal canister,
densely packed with hydrazine nitrate explosive
and a simple, remote-triggered circuit.
But this utilized a different triggering mechanism
than the synagogue bombing?
No, no.
It was identical.
A modified flashbulb?
Yes, from a camera. It's quite clever.
It produces just enough flame to trigger the fuse.
Oh, that's interesting.
But when you reported on the synagogue bombing,
you never mentioned that fact.
It's kind of a technical detail.
A little beyond the scope of a basic news article.
Of course.
It's just that whoever planted the bomb at the Vindicator
had to know the layout of the building,
the dumbwaiters, Mr. Sanborn's schedule,
and how to build a bomb exactly like the Defenders of Allah's.
Objection, Your Honor!
Objection? There hasn't been a question yet.
Overruled.
And if you never reported on the triggering mechanism,
Mr. Thiessen, the only person I can think of
who possesses all of that knowledge would be you.
Objection, Your Honor.
This is completely without basis.
Yes, I'm afraid you're right.
I have to sustain that objection.
Well, that's okay,
Your Honor. I have nothing further.
Mrs. Florrick,
thank you for visiting.
Peter.
Pastor.
Pastor, this is Zach and Grace.
Welcome.
Mrs. Florrick,
would you ever like to talk sometime,
just the two of us?
No.
I have respected the way you've stood by your husband.
It's a lesson in forbearance.
Well, it's a lesson in something.
You told your boss.
About being poached? Sure.
And Julius?
I told you that in confidence.
Stern found out I leaked.
He fired me.
I know. That's why the coffee.
Why'd you tell them?
Why didn't you just come over to Stern's?
You don't seem like the loyal type.
I know.
It's crazy, huh?
What about Lockhart/Gardner?
Is there a job there?
For who?
Me.
No.
What are you doing?
The coffee was too hot to throw in your face.
I'm talking about the very essence of our faith.
Take care.
What does Christian forbearance mean?
When the Apostle Paul wrote in Philippians, Chapter Four, Verse Five,
"Let your forbearing spirit be evident to all,"
What did he mean by that?
Did he mean that we should tell our neighbor...
I'll be right back.
I'll put up with you until you improve? No.
Christian forbearance has no time limits...
Gerry.
Okay, it's just us. What's up?
He's got me in a corner. Childs.
He's got stuff on me even you don't know about,
and he'll use it.
Unless you testify against me?
Peter, I have no choice.
You know Childs is going to make you lie on the stand.
It's not all lies.
Not the videotape of us.
You know the meeting in the hotel room.
Do you believe in hell?
Do I believe in hell?
Sure. Why?
Do you believe you have to answer for your sins?
Peter, we don't have time.
Do you believe it?
Actually, I do, yes.
Peter, I'm sorry.
He threatened me.
Childs threatened me. He threatened everything.
Let's not even talk about the stuff I have on you,
because you're beyond caring about that.
Let's, let's talk about the stuff I have on your son Anthony.
Your married son.
That's right.
Your beautiful legacy.
Peter.
Peter, don't.
Don't. You're a Christian.
You're damn right I am.
Haven't you read the Old Testament?
Tonight's good. Yeah.
No.
Oh, I can make the reservation.
No, it's fine.
Will, really, it's fine.
Hey, I phoned you.
Good. We'll have fun.
Okay, I'll see you soon.
You're going out?
Yup.
Where?
I don't know.
Preheat the oven for ten minutes.
Ignore the box.
It says it cooks in 12 minutes, but it's really 15.
Oh, come on. Am I not supposed to be jealous?
I don't think I care what you are.
Tell Zach only one hour on the computer.
I... I feel like you're punishing me for something I didn't do.
I'm not punishing you, Peter.
I'm going out to dinner with an old friend.
What you saw at church was me protecting our family.
The guy was wearing a wire.
It's over.
What is?
Us. Me caring.
Me actually thinking that you're changing.
I am changing.
No, you're not.
You want to think you are
so you can go back to what you did before.
Then help me.
Help me.
If you're right, help me.
No.
You once said
that everything would be fine if we just kept talking.
We can... We can argue,
we can fight, but we have to keep talking.
So, there's nothing I can say?
