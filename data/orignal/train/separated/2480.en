二十五季第六集
*One is the loneliest number*
*That you'll ever do*
*Two can be as bad as one*
*It's the loneliest number since the number one*
*No is the saddest experience you'll ever know*
*Yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know*
*'Cause one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do*
*One is the loneliest number, worse than two*
情人节死于心肌梗死
*And one...* You know, I really think I've made my point.
Oh, the rain has washed away the playground shed!
I'm being chased by sports!
It's called "Precipitation," 'cause it never fails
to precipitate unruly behavior.
And saddest of all, those who do not have a friend
to play with in the rain,
doomed to get only single pneumonia.
A spit wad?
Well, at least I'm getting some attention.
And the best part is I'm bombarding her
with her own homework.
丽莎·辛普森
Begone!
Well, you're never alone surrounded by...
The Autobiography of Charles Manson?
古老西部时代的文化和习俗
Hi. New kid, second grade.
Don't you love the rain?
New kid?
Uh, have you made any friends?
Just Charlotte, Emily and Anne.
That's a reference to the Bronte sisters!
You got my reference to the Bronte sisters?!
Nice to meet you, Lisa Simpson.
How do you know my name?
I deciphered the anagrams on your notebook.
平凡的姑娘 你猜啊
Be Lisa?
Isabel!
Ooh, spaghetti.
Y'ello!
Lisa, you got a call from someone named Isabel.
May I ask what this is regarding?
Ooh! A budding new friendship? Oh!
Boy, how come you can't get a new friend?
What's wrong with the one I got?
I finally got that M&M out of my inner ear.
I remembered correctly, it was a green one!
Don't eat it. It's been in his ear.
Don't eat it.It's been in his ear.
Don't eat it. It's been in the boy's ear and the dog's mouth.
Don't eat it.
Oh, for God's sake!
And don't you hate being the middle child?
Yeah. In the car, I always have to sit on the hump.
It makes reading impossible.
Lisa, your food's getting cold!
It's raw veggies. They're supposed to be cold!
Well, someone who loves you put melted butter on them!
Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom.
I'll tell Lisa you dropped by.
I better go.
Okay, but one more thing:
I noticed we're both doing presentations
on Franklin Roosevelt at school. Why don't we do them together?
Oh, my God. Someone wants to be my partner.
Can't screw this up.
Downloading, downloading, downloading,
downloading, downloading...
Franklin Roosevelt bravely instituted
a series of reforms called the New Deal.
Which ran totally counter
to America's tradition of limited government.
P.S. It was also unconstitutional.
Um, FDR's steadfast leadership
also helped America win World War Two.
Until the weak-kneed Democrats sold us out at Yalta.
If you haven't guessed, Lisa, I'm a Republican.
A Lincoln Republican?
Not really.
A Reagan Republican?
Keep going.
First President Bush?
Getting there.
Oh, dear God.
I must say, Lisa,
it was amusing to see you thoroughly de-high-horsed.
That isn't a word.
Ooh, back on the saddle she climbs.
I just can't believe someone like you
would be a Republican.
I mean, isn't your last name Gutiérrez?
Just what exactly are you saying?
I'm just saying that people of your heritage-
which could be any one of many heritages,
I'm not pigeonholing...
Is it a Catholic thing?
I'm a non-observant Jew from Argentina.
Ay, caramba!
Do you even know what that means?
Uh, there-there's a caramba in my eye?
It's the Spanish version of "Hot damn."
Ay, caramba!
Hmm? Lisa, is everything okay?
Yes. Why?
Because you're doing your homework
and you don't look happy.
My new best friend isn't what I thought.
She's a... Republican!
What is so funny?
They're destroying the world!
They are, huh?
I thought I'd show you this
when you were older, but...
美国的早晨
You voted for Reagan?!
It was a crazy time, the '80s.
You don't hear me listening to the Thompson Twins anymore.
Although...
*Hold me now...*
So, you were going through a phase?
All right, '80s party!
Where's the beef?
*Tear down that wall*
*Because I think the beef is behind that wall*
鼓舞人心绝佳歌曲
*You say I'm a dreamer...*
Now get up here, boy!
We're gonna do "The Super Bowl Shuffle."
No! You never let me be Mike Singletary!
Fine. You're Mike Singletary.
Enjoy your mediocre coaching career.
My name is Homer, I'm a real fullback
Gonna run that ball, don't want no flack
If you try to run, you'll get a heart attack
Why you little...!
Hey, big man, don't want no trouble
I'm just here to do "The Super Bowl...
Shuffle..."
Excuse me.
People's views change.
Bobby Kennedy worked for Joe McCarthy.
Larry David was on Fridays.
What are you trying to say?
Isabel's only eight. As she grows up,
surprising things will happen
to her body... of beliefs.
But she could always use a friend like you.
Isabel?
Lisa?
Listen, I'm really sorry about...
No, it's okay.
My mom says you're just going through a liberal phase.
What?! My mom says you're going through a conservative phase.
There's no such thing.
Conservatives only get more conservative.
Because every year,
they get a little further through Atlas Shrugged.
Listen, we're both eight years old.
Can't we just play Monopoly or something?
My father owns a monopoly!

That young filly is exactly the kind of candidate
we need to start recruiting!
She's a young, dynamic Latina.
Yee-haw! I said that just right!
Without the Hispanic vote,
even Texas is poised to turn blue.
Blue!
Yeah, we must reach her and groom her
before she fattens up like Chris Christie.
He thinks GOP stands for "Gravy on Pancakes."
But despite my mirthful remarks, obesity is no laughing matter.
雄起吧少年 来竞选班委
Just can't resist those words, "Sign-up sheet."
Oh, looks like I'll be running against Isabel.
And Ralph?
Just call me Ralph Nader.
I don't know why.
Isabel!
I want this campaign to be about the issues:
same-sex field trip buddies,
providing class pets with a path to citizenship...
And no digging up past relationships.
Sure, Lisa and I dated.
Sure, she broke my heart.
I'm sure your researchers know all about it.
This is the first I've heard of it.
Really? But I got this!
How long has it been since you washed your stomach?
You can't ask that anymore!
Quit shoving!
I'd like a word with you, young lady.
How did you get in there?
Slid in through the grates.
Here's the scoop.
You're our future,
so we can't afford to have you lose.
And I love the Spanish--
from the Inquisition to the delightful Franco years.
佛朗哥时期 弗朗西斯科·佛朗哥独裁统治西班牙的时期
What are you talking about?
Move over! I know how to talk to kids.
We want to give you a little present.
A tainted victory that will haunt you forever.
I'd rather do this myself.
But who'd own you then?
You couldn't buy me with a wheelbarrow full of ice cream.
Whoa, nicely done.
You've charmed another one right into the arms
of the Libertarian Party.
Maybe we can help her without her knowing we're helping her.
No one says I can't buy a second grade election.
Why, I had enough money to fix People Magazine's
Sexiest Man Alive.
Most of the money went to convincing them
that I was alive.
Who ordered the Yumboni?
Right here!
Now, Smithers, I want you to eat this for me.
Describe every taste.
And don't forget the brain freeze.
Sir, I am lactose-intolerant.
And I'm back-talk-allergic!
So start eating!
Have a great day, kids.
And, Bart, I'll pick you up after school
to take you to karate lessons.
Mom, after six weeks, I figured out
that Sensei Weinstein is really my psychiatrist.
Either way, for 45 minutes, you're not my problem, sweetie.
Don't worry, Lisa, despite the paid ad,
I am strictly middle of the road.
Idiot!
Pick a lane!
What are you doing?!
I'm as bewildered as you are.
I don't know why,
but the Springfield Republican Party is grooming me.
Grooming? Yuck!
Unfortunately, I can't stop it.
The Supreme Court says spending money is free speech.
Well, then you could use your free speech
to denounce this intrusion of big money into our election.
Mm, I'll think about it
while I'm on my listening tour of the cafeteria.
Pour me another.
What are you doing?
It's imaginary.
Fine.
I got to go.
I'll see you later.
Ay, caramba!
Bart, I need you to help me win the election.
I can help, but it's gonna get rough.
I'm fine with rough.
You don't know what rough is.
That ain't rough.
More like a gentle breeze.
Maggie hits harder.
Did the good night pixie just kiss my cheek?
Okay, you got my attention.
You want to win this election?
Then from now on, you do exactly what I say.
Now, the other candidate, Lisa Simpson.
Okay, I'm a liberal.
And sometimes that's a dirty word.
Liberal.
But what liberal really means is someone who believes
that those who have more than enough
should share a little with those who don't.
And those principles
have consistently been in place
during this country's most prosperous times.
So if that's a liberal,
then I am a liberal.
And hang me.
Sorry, we're just setting up
for An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.
The Democratic Party pantheon.
四大自由 新政 新边疆
Such lofty ideals.
And here come the spirits.
Michael Dukakis, Walter Mondale,
John Kerry?
These are all losers!
I'm afraid you're heading for a loss, Lisa.
And when we lose, we lose big.
What about Obama?
Harry Truman?
Bill Clinton?
Lisa, you're a lot like me.
Play the saxophone, come from a small town,
raised by a mother with no help.
So, do you know how I can win?
I don't even know why I'm a ghost.
All these guys are alive.
John Kerry here is Secretary of State.
Doing a bang-up job.
Well, we still have a long way
to go on Asian currency issues.
Absolutely.
And, Lisa, I'm only appearing in this dream
so I can visit with you about the Clinton Global Initiative.
See, our mission is to turn ideas into action.
And to find innovative solutions that will hel...
Hey, hey, hey!
You can't fall asleep in a dream!
I know what I've got to do.
Hello, Isabel? Listen...
CGI also convenes CGI America,
a meeting devoted to economic recovery and job creation.
You used to be fun!
Kevin Costner used to be a movie star.
Get over it.
And now for their final debate,
please welcome, uh, Li... um...
Li-sa? Li-sa, uh, Simpsone.
Yes.
And, uh, Isabel Adolpho-Guzman-Lopez Gutierrez.
Uh, ladies.
I just want to say, I don't care about politics,
electioneering or negative campaigning.
If my friend Lisa wins, so be it.
And I also want to say that if...
Time's up. But I...
Stop showboating.
Back in the banner shed you go.
Good morning.
We have completed the tally of the votes
for class representative.
One brief announcement: the tainted Greek salad
has given several students
nightmares involving Michael Dukakis.
It may recur tonight, so if possible,
have your parents strap you to the bed.
And now the results.
First grade rep-- results delayed indefinitely
due to jelly on the ballots.
Second grade rep--
Isabel Gutierrez.
Third grade rep, no votes cast.
Congratulations, Isabel.
Fourth grade rep-- last name Weiner, first name Ima...
I truly hope you enjoy the Friday morning council meetings.
Simpson!
And the-the free snicker doodle cookies.
Smithers, we won!
Drop the balloons!
Can I at least remove the balloons?
Do it and you'll kill him.
Hey, Lis.
Hey.
I'm sorry I fired you.
Eh, no hard feelings.
A lot of good things have been happening to me.
Thanks, Bart.
I think you might feel better
if you looked at these exit polls.
They find me a pointy-haired know-it-all.
Yes, but they agreed with everything you said.
What are you getting at?
53% said they'd vote for a liberal.
Just not you.
Huh. You hear that, world?
They love my ideas, just not me!
And that is half the battle!
Ha!
Hello, I'm elder Anderson Cooper.
Welcome to our first debate
between Republican Isabel Gutierrez
and Lisa Simpson, representing
the Democratic Robot Zombie Coalition.
First question: Ms. Simpson, what would you do
to get America out of Afghanistan?
I'd just throw in the towel and make it a state.
That's our girl.
