Criminal Minds S05E12
Joe what's your 20?
Almost done with rounds.
Just checking the carousel.
You need some backup? I'm falling asleep here.
No.
But could you leave a cupful of coffee in the pot?
Anyone back here?
This is private property.
I'm gonna give you 5 seconds to come on out.
Funny Don.
I'm a man of simple pleasures
And that was one of them.
What are you doing back here?
Switching out a timing belt. What are you doing back here?
Thought I saw someone messing around.
Nah it was just me.
It wasn't you.
Turn it off.
What?
Turn it off!
What?
Ed?
Go ahead.
You need to send that backup.
I see checkmate in 5. What do you see?
I see it in 3.
We've missed you out here.
Thank you.
Thanks. I uh I had to take a little break.
How come?
I used to play with a co-Worker friend of mine.
He's probably the best mind I ever went up against.
One day he just decided that he didn't want to play anymore.
So you gave up too?
Just the opposite. I attempted to play
through every permutation of moves on a chessboard.
That's an infinite number of games.
It's not infinite. It's just--
it's exponentially large.
You couldn't have played through them all.
There's an average of 40 moves per chess game
And I'll tell you something-- The more I played
The more I realized that every single match
Every single chess game
Is really just a simple variation on the exact same theme.
You know? It's aggressive opening
Patient mid-Game
inevitable checkmate
And I realized why my friend quit.
He was tired of repeating the exact same patterns
And expecting a different outcome.
So you have a lifetime
of chess strategy in your head
and you're just sitting on it.
I still use it.
I just uh... I apply it differently.
I have to go.
It was good seeing you.
Rita Stuart 25
Second victim in Atlantic city.
Pretty public spot for a dump site.
You know technically
I think it would qualify more as a disposal site.
You don't leave a body on a merry-Go-Round out of convenience.
He took some time with her appearance didn't he?
Yeah. Her nails were polished
Her hair was cut clothes were brand-New.
Wants her to look her best when found.
That's a lot of remorse.
Who is victim number one?
Stacia Jackson 29.
She was found at a local playground.
Quite a change in victimology.
What's the connection between these women?
There is none. Rita was married Stacia was single.
Rita worked at a diner
Stacia was a corporate lawyer.
According to their credit cards
They never came within 10 miles of each other.
Both women were taken 2 months ago?
Yeah. They lived such completely different lives
The police didn't tie their abduction together until now.
Was there any evidence of sexual assault?
There was no evidence of violence of any kind.
So how did they die?
Rita had a stroke
Stacia had a brain hemorrhage.
Look at this
the unsub gave them a battery of drugs--
Atracurium doxacurium.
These are neural inhibitors.
They block signals from the brain to the muscles.
He put them in medical comas for 2 months.
Actually they weren't in a coma.
You'd need phenobarbital
to keep them unconscious
and they didn't have that.
So wait a minute. These victims were paralyzed
but they were still conscious?
They could open their eyes hear
Probably even feel stimulation.
Physical immobility but mental awareness.
This unsub wants total domination over them.
And he turns their bodies
into prisons to do it.
Mildred Lsette Norman wrote
"Anything you cannot relinquish
"When it has outlived its usefulness
"Possesses you
"And in this materialistic age
A great many of us
are possessed by our possessions."
Keeping women in a conscious paralysis
reads as sadism.
Definitely dehumanizing
Reducing them to objects.
But there's nothing else about this profile
That takes us down that path.
These women were found in excellent condition.
There was no evidence of bed sores
They were well fed through an I.V.
His access to I.V.S and drugs--
he almost certainly has medical training.
Are we sure this is a he?
The care this unsub shows these victims
although they are dehumanized
the profile says female.
What about the postmortem posing?
That's a lot of dead weight
for a woman to carry.
These women are petite. They're under 100 pounds.
All right if we reconsider the gender of the profile
what changes?
Nothing. If anything it fits better.
Men kill to fulfill a sexual compulsion. Women don't.
You see this in angel of mercy killers
Like Genene Jones and Amy Archer.
They didn't care about race or hair color.
It's men that do.
Damn straight. Men do.
Well hello red. look at you. guys.
Garcia what did you find out about the clothing
the unsub's dressing the victims in?
At first only that both garments were made from chiffon.
But with the wonder twin powers of the Atlantic City police
and my impeccable eye for fashion
we have also determined that these garments fit rediculous well
They're super flattering to each victim's exact measurements
Kind of exactly like the unsub whipped them up herself.
Maybe that's what connects the victims.
How so?
Maybe she isn't just killing petite women
because they're easier to abduct and pose.
But because of a physical type.
She wants a body type.
Sewing clothes for a specific size of woman.
Please tell me she is not killing these women because she needs human models.
I mean there's gotta be more to it than that.
There probably is.
But at least we have a start on the victimology.
Prentiss and Morgan
I want you to interview the victims' family.
Talk to them about lifestyle choices.
Any body image issues these women may have had.
Reid go to Rita Stuart's autopsy
See if the drugs point to any specific medical training
the unsub might have had.
Dave and I will go to the disposal site.
And Garcia.
Sir.
I want you to check missing persons reports for the last 2 months.
see if any abductions match what we know.
we need to find out if the unsub's already taken another victim.
Agent Jareau?
Detective Marty Cotrone.
Hi. These are SSAs
Morgan and Prentiss.
Were you able to contact the families?
They're already here.
Did they bring the pictures we asked for?
Yeah. They were pretty confused by that.
And to be honest so am I.
Agent Morgan I don't understand.
How does what my daughter looked like
have to do with the monster who killed her?
We think the unsub is looking for a physical type.
Fit but petite.
This is her. Ihis is my wife.
Did Rita work out stay in shape?
Sure. I guess.
She went to the gym at least 3 times a week.
Stacia took pride in every aspect of her appearance.
In what way?
You know her clothes.
It was her clothes. she loved to shop.
It looks like she has kind of a bohemian streak going on.
Yeah.
What were her favorite places to shop?
High-end boutiques.
Expensive ones?
Certainly.
And dressed to fit.
She was tiny.
Everything had to be taken in
So she'd look...
Her best.
Would you mind writing down Some of her favorite places to go?
So these are mostly consignment and thrift shops?
That's really all we could afford.
Did she ever have these clothes altered?
Uh tailored to fit her better?
I never really paid attention.
Would she ever have worn something like that?
Would she ever wear anything like that?
No.
Dave!
Can you hear that?
Yeah.
She's posing her victims in a place that represents innocence and childhood.
Most serial killers don't have a
particularly happy childhood.
My guess is she wants them to have the fun
She never got to have.
Let's think about how she's doing this practically.
How's she getting them from her car to the carousel?
She's moving a body in the middle of the night.
She needs to make conditions as favorable as possible.
So she'd need a vehicle that afforded her privacy--
A van or an suv.
That's still a lot of ground to cover once she parks.
Even if these women are light
She risks getting caught carrying a corpse.
If she has a medical background
what if she use a wheelchair
something that would help her move them quickly?
And if she has a wheelchair
That means her van has a lift
which would be helpful to unload a body.
Which also means she has a handicap placard.
Which would give her the closest place to park.
I'll have Garcia pull all vehicles
With handicap registrations.
Thanks Dave.
Once I have the knees bent
I can get leverage under her.
Normally an assistant helps me.
But I can do it by myself if I need to.
I'm assuming the unsub would have this training too.
Let me ask you this-- is there anything specific about it?
No any caregiver out there can do this--
Docs nurses orderlies.
Where do you think she's getting the drugs that she's using?
Do you think she could be manipulating a doctor or a pharmacist maybe?
He'd be criminally negligent if she was.
But it is possible. I mean doctors order things
through residents nurses forge signatures
prescriptions fall through cracks.
That's a lot of drugs and a lot of cracks.
She keeps these women paralyzed for 2 months.
Your report said both of them
had hair extensions clipped in.
Yes to hide the fact that clumps of their real hair had fallen out.
But if they were fed through I.V.S
That wasn't from malnutrition right?
You see this a lot in bedridden patients.
Loss of motor function. Especially in a young woman like this.
Of course.
Psychic shock.
Yeah the mental effects take a physical toll.
One last question... in your professional opinion
do you think the hair extensions were clipped on before or after death?
Before.
And you seem pretty certain of that?
You know the old wives' tale about your hair and nails
growing after death.
What's really happening is that dehydration
is shrinking your skin pulling it back.
Based on where she put these extensions
they were definitely still alive.
Now we know this unsub is stuck in a rich fantasy right?
An incredibly detailed delusion.
We don't know what the delusion is
but we know that it involves remaking these women
and it begins the moment she has them drugged.
So she has them paralyzed and she can do whatever she wants
why is she killing them?
Well I don't think she means to.
The brain is a machine designed to respond to stimuli.
If you keep the brain awake but the body immobile
it breaks down loses its hair.
After 2 months it eventually strokes out.
So death isn't this unsub's goal
it's an unfortunate side effect.
Exactly. What'd you find out?
Both Rita Stuart and Stacia Jackson were clothes hounds
but because they were petite women they had a lot of their stuff altered.
Could be how our unsub is finding her victims.
She gets her hands on their measurements.
But we already exhausted tailors alteration shops.
There's no overlap.
The tailors might send specialty items out to third parties.
Dig deep into extended employment records
and see who they might be subcontracting to.
Garcia needs to talk to us.
Go ahead Garcia.
Hello my pretties. I have finished my missing persons sweep.
I've got nothing on the medical vehicle
but 2 new matches on the clothes make the woman front.
Cindy Admundson. She was abducted outside a thrift store
and Maxine Wynan was last seen at the Hillridge mall.
That sounds like our girl.
Any surveillance footage at the mall?
No. It was an outside parking lot. So sorry.
The new abductees... What's their physical type?
They look pretty tiny to me.
I'm gonna send you pictures. Also if it pleases the court
I would like to direct your attention to exhibit "a "
the calendar map.
What about it?
Both of these new victims were abducted one week ago
exactly one day before the bodies of Rita Stuart
and Stacia Jackson respectively turned up.
She doesn't let a body go until she has a replacement.
Thank you so much.
Excuse me.
Do you need some help?
Oh the ramp's broken.
You want me to call a tow truck?
I just need to get the chair in the van
and then I can go home.
Well we could load it.
You think?
Sure. We'll put it in the back?
Go on in.
You pull I'll lift.
Ok.
Here we go.
Do we need to lock the wheels or anything like that?
You're so pretty.
Victim is Mary Newsome.
Abducted 2 months ago.
She was found on this bench first thing this morning.
Ok well it looks like her style.
It's chiffon and it's sewn to fit.
If she's disposed of this body it means she's recently taken a new victim.
We'll call Hotch we'll comb through missing persons reports
from the last 48 hours.
I'll pulling them.
Thank you. Mm-Hmm.
What?
These aren't hair extensions.
Maybe her hair was too brittle.
Maybe. I don't know.
You know what? This is a wig.
Kanekalon I think.
What's that?
Uh synthetic hair. There's nothing special about it.
It's used in wigs all over the world.
But look at this.
Ooh. Are those stitches?
On her scalp.
She sewed this in.
Yeah. Wallace. I got it. Thank you.
Hey I think we found who was taken last night.
Her name is Bethany Wallace.
Her husband says she never came home from the dry cleaners
where she stopped off to pick up some clothes.
Anybody at the cleaners see anything?
The employees were busy locking up. But they did mention
that they do farm out work to tailors who work from home.
Good. We can match records based on who worked on Bethany's Clothes.
We just got the pictures of the 2 recent abductions from Garcia.
Line up the photos of the new victims
next to the bodies they replaced. That might help us with the timeline.
You guys see this?
Yeah. She's matching up the victims physically one to one.
She's a collector.
We're ready to give the profile.
The unsub we're looking for is a woman.
She's a collector.
It's a psychopathology similar to hoarding.
So when we say collector
We're not talking about stamps or baseball cards.
It's not what your kids or even you
Might pursue as a normal hobby.
This is an attachment to objects that's become obsessive
By someone who is antisocial and extremely introverted.
These people attach a part of themselves
To their collection.
If you try to separate them from it
Or take it away from them
They will react violently even psychotically.
They've suffered damage to their prefrontal cortex.
That's the part of the brain that regulates
Basic freudian fantasy/reality.
They can still function like drive a car
Go to work even do their taxes.
In fact she excels at goal-oriented jobs
Like the precision of sewing.
Or the details of abduction.
But they've lost their ability to categorize the difference
Between living and dead uh belonging and loss.
That has been irreparably destroyed.
So what's she collecting women?
Actually
We think she's collecting dolls.
Technically replacing them.
We believe that she lost the originals
Sometime within the last 3 months
And this is what served as her stressor.
She searched for a replacement
And when she couldn't find them
She started abducting the closest possible surrogate.
Women of different ethnicities
But of similar physicality.
The drug-Induced paralysis is part of the fantasy.
She puts her victims in a position where they can't talk back
So she can fetishize them like the objects she's lost.
I respect your analysis
But this woman kidnapped 6 women
And killed 3 of them.
And you're telling us this is about dolls?
This unsub stitched a wig
Onto the scalp of her latest victim.
It's a technique used to attach hair to porcelain dolls.
And keep in mind collectors and serial killers
Do share certain traits. Uh...
A lot of serial killers take trophies
Attaching the same significance to them
That this collector does to objects.
But this unsub's intent isn't violence.
She needs this collection to be complete
So she can feel in control of her life
Probably to overcome some trauma she experienced.
She really only feels that control
When the collection is complete
Which is why she's repeating an abduction pattern with living victims.
If she loses a doll or in this case
If she loses a woman who represents a doll
She has to replace it.
This woman works alone.
We know she has medical training.
Look for nurse's aides or orderlies
Who were fired for a lack of social graces.
She can't fake a bedside manner.
We believe she's currently working
As a tailor or a seamstress
And we're following those leads now.
But do let us know
If you notice any overlap in your suspect pools.
Thank you.
Of course i remember ms. Jackson.
We were all sad to hear what happened.
Do you ever farm out tailoring jobs
Someone who might have done this?
No.
To be perfectly honest
We wouldn't even sell something so dated.
Let me take a look.
Where did you get this?
Why? Did you see something?
Look at this lockstitch.
It's a handkerchief pattern.
You see this on silk-Sewn handkerchiefs.
And it's all done by hand.
So this is her signature? This is unique to her.
I couldn't do it not even with a machine.
If there someplace that specializes
In handcrafted sewing like this?
No.
I'll tell you this much though.
She's been at it a long time.
This woman...
Is an artist.
Hotch this is bethany wallace's husband karl.
We brought him in for questioning.
Do you know where my wife is?
We're searching for her sir.
No. You have to find her in the next 24 hours.
Bethany is a diabetic.
Look agent prentiss said
That the woman who took her
Has medical training.
So...bethany could have a chance?
What?
She keeps her victims in a drug-Induced state.
They can't communicate.
These...these drugs will they--
We don't know.
But we're doing everything we can.
Everyone
This is Sally.
Be nice to her.
So doctor if a diabetics were given
this battery of drugs to keep her paralyzed
What would the reaction be?
Diabetics metabolize everything they consume differently.
Food drinks drugs.
It all gets broken down to blood sugar
At varying rates.
Most likely this patient seized up
Minutes after she was medicated.
So she's already dead.
Probably.
Although...
There is another possibility.
Bethany's condition could break down the drugs
Faster than the other victims.
She could regain control of her body?
Every hour that she doesn't turn up is a reason for hope.
We're still running out of time.
If the drugs don't kill Bethany
She's not gonna last long without insulin.
Look collectors are good honest people.
Just because you enjoy dolls doesn't make you a freak or a pedophile.
We appreciate that sir
But the woman that we're looking for
Has lost her ability to control her obsession.
She's killed 3 women trying to recreate a type of doll
She had as a child.
Describe the line to me.
Well there's a pattern to the victims.
They're in their 20s and they're petite.
Most doll lines revolve around infants.
Is she dressing them like babies?
No she's not.
Their wardrobe consists of chiffon dresses
Worn by one blond woman a redhead and a black woman.
The dresses--Is she sewing them herself?
How did you know that?
It's the Valois line.
Local company back in the late eighties.
Probably when our unsub was prepubescent.
Yeah.
They promoted feminism and multiculturalism.
Strong independent girls from different backgrounds
Who could still be friends.
Reid. Birth certificate to fill out.
A form to describe their lives.
And a kit to sew your own clothes.
JJ said she's been at it for a while.
She's probably been sewing since she was a little kid.
Wait a minute. Sir what's this contest that they held?
That was to see who could come up with the most imaginative doll.
Sew a dress. Write an essay to describe her.
If you won the contest you'd have your doll featured in next year's line.
I assume that didn't end well did it?
No it did not.
It's a classic tool child psychologists use.
Tell me a story with these dolls.
When the company got essays with thinly-veiled references
To physical or sexual abuse
They turned the entry forms and the dolls over to the police.
The publicity killed the line.
You said the company was local right?
They might still have the clothes in evidence.
How are the essays going?
Makes for some pretty depressing reading.
Prentiss is having a good time.
These dolls are all like little time capsules
Only the eighties fashion wasn't so kind to them.
I'm surprised how many little girls
knew how to make shoulder pads.
How's it going on your end?
I got a list of vendors the victims went to--
tailors seamstresses that sort of thing.
Hey JJ you said something about a handkerchief hem right?
That's exactly like what she sews for her victims.
What's the name on the entry?
Samantha Malcolm.
She's on my list.
Wait a minute guys. I have her essay around here somewhere.
Right here.
"Sally doesn't like the room with the lightning."
That can't be good.
Ok guys I just got Samantha Malcolm's
Medical records and...
Oh my god she was doomed.
Like Emily Bronte doomed
Like Shakespeare doomed
Like Red-Shirted ensign in "Star Trek" doomed.
Garcia what happened to her?
Oh uh sorry uh
Well for the first 10 years nothing
and then she started a battery of electroshock treatments.
At 10? Who subjects a child to ECT?
That would be her father Dr. Arthur Malcolm.
He runs an inpatient mental health facility
for troubled young people called New Lives.
At first the essay that Samantha wrote raised some flags
But her father explained that the therapy
was to deal with the recent death of her mother.
After that he started her
on a serious regimen of anti-Psychotic drugs
which he weaned her off of a few years ago.
It explains her familiarity with medication.
Where is she now?
Uh her father declared her incompetent
so he's still the legal guardian.
Everything is in his name.
And all of her records list New Lives as her residence.
She couldn't keep victims in an inpatient facility.
She needs privacy.
Garcia what about real estate holdings
In her father's name?
Just his own. But New Lives has
a bunch of outpatient and halfway houses all over town.
JJ where does she work?
I have her placed at 3 different shops around town.
All right let's split up and cover the shops and the facility.
I want to go to New Lives.
Whether or not she's there I want to talk to the father.
There are literally hundreds of therapies to help kids through loss.
Electroshock is not one of them.
Take Rossi.
Be nice to each other.
See you later.
We're leaving.
No...no.
I am very confused gentlemen.
What does this have to do with Samantha?
We need to talk to her. Is she here?
No she's at work.
Does she live here
or did you move her into one of your halfway houses?
As a matter of fact she is in one of my houses.
Well we'll need the address.
And I'll need to know what this is about.
She might be tied to a series of abductions.
That's not possible. It's not my daughter.
Is samantha on her own at this house?
There are no other patients right?
She thought that was best and I agreed.
Yeah but let's face it--
You're happy that she's out of your hair.
I beg your pardon?
Because if you had been visiting her recently doctor
You would know what she's been doing.
Samantha has always been troubled.
3 women are dead because of her.
She's not capable of that.
Are you certain?
I mean the effects of electroshock
Especially at that age are permanent.
But maybe you knew that.
My wife died when samantha was 10
And she never recovered.
I tried everything.
Child psychiatry pet therapy
Nothing helped.
She was cutting herself.
She was in pain.
That's the end of this meeting.
Where's your daughter doctor?
And agent rossi if you try to talk to her
A mentally ill woman
without her knowing what she's doing--
Do you know about the women she's keeping?
And have no medical or legal counsel present
You'll have no case. Do you understand me? None.
We'll keep the police here
In case samantha drops in for a visit.
Let's go reid.
Hey a really fast question.
Why are these toys here?
I use them in my therapy.
No i understand that
but why are they way up on this shelf
Away from where any kids can actually reach them?
They're reminders of patients that i've helped.
Let me ask you something.
What was the name of the girl you helped with this one?
Jenny larson.
Hmm. And this one?
What was the name of the girl You helped with this one?
Abigail moore.
How about this one?
Linda krauss.
These girls are what
they're like 9.12 years old i'm assuming?
My ph.D. Is on the effect of trauma
On prepubescent girls.
I do not appreciate what you're implying.
Oh i'm not implying anything.
I'm making an inference.
An inference is an educated guess.
And based on that I form a hypothesis.
For instance my hypothesis here
Is that after you raped your daughter
You submitted her to electroshock treatment
To make sure she stayed quiet.
This is outrageous.
And then out of guilt you bought her toys
More specifically you bought her a line of dolls.
Because that's what serial molesters do.
They give gifts.
So you continued the pattern
With your other patients
And once they left your care
you added their toys to your collection.
I'm sorry you can't back up your story doctor.
This is why i love my job doctor.
Because my lab it's a jury of your peers.
My tests will be Jenny Larson Abigail Moore
and Linda Krauss.
The D.A. Will put them on the stand
and I'm going to personally bring these dolls in
and we're going to watch how they react.
Or you could tell us where your daughter is
and we'll tell the d.A. You cooperated.
But once we walk out this door
that deal comes off the table.
2529 Adams Street.
You'll tell them right? That I cooperated.
You want to know how I figured you out?
Those toys.
You take care of them.
These ones you treasured.
But you know what? The collection's not complete.
Where are they?
She's coming back.
I have to put it back in.
No please.
Please don't.
I'm sorry.
Don't leave me.
Let us go.
I can't.
Samantha?
Hi.
Uh my name's Spencer.
I'm with the FBI.
I know what your father did to you
and I want you to know
that he can never ever hurt you again.
He never touched me. He's a good father.
He loves me.
I know that he probably forced you to say those things
and he punished you if you got it wrong
sent you to the room with the lightning.
Yeah.
The dolls that your father gave you after he hurt you
What would happen to them?
He kept them in his office with the other toys.
That's where he let you play with them?
But when I moved out I had to take my friends with me.
I couldn't leave them behind.
Of course. And so you went you get them.
What--What did you find?
He gave them to another girl didn't he?
Do you want them back?
He said I couldn't.
He said they were gone for good.
He lied. He's been lying to you for a long time.
Do you want to see them?
Can I?
Yeah. Yeah do you want to play with them?
Clear. We need medical here.
Hold on. Hold on one second.
Hey Samantha?
Listen. You need to go with these men
but your friends can go with you ok?
They won't take-- They won't take them away?
I promise
no one will ever take them away again.
Well done Agent Reid.
Thanks.
Checkmate in 12.
No way.
Let me show you.
