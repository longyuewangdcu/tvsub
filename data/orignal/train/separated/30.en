Well, let's start with soft targets.
These are reductions you can make
without further layoffs or reorganization.
Is one of them IT?
Why don't you just tell us?
Certainly. Annually, you spend $10,000 on paper products. Cups.
You're kidding.
We would suggest moving to a self-policing hydration policy.
You spend $38,000
on season tickets to the Chicago Cubs.
Yeah, but that's good business.
We entertain clients.
We would suggest season tickets for a less expensive sport franchise,
the Chicago Red Stars.
The...?
Professional women's soccer.
We got to cut somewhere.
The floral budget for the firm is $28,000.
Yup. Cut somewhere.
We would suggest moving to perennials or going artificial.
We also suggest you no longer validate for parking.
The self-policing hydration policy would be presented as going green
with fact sheets posted next to coolers on reducing landfills.
Hello.
Oh, it's...
Uh, hi. Is, uh...?
Uh, no. Alicia left her phone at home.
You want to leave a message?
No. She's with another lawyer.
I'll try him. Thanks.
Okay.
Good morning.
Dorfman & Associates.
Sorry, we don't have our phones in yet, Mr. Gardner.
Let me tell Alicia.
Mr. Gardner wants you to start without him.
Thanks. Can you get us coffee?
Partners offices here.
Conference room there.
Waiting room.
I think this is some kind of flowing thing.
What is it?
A glassed-in waterfall.
My daughter's the designer.
We have the drywall in next week.
Wow. No longer a mom-and-pop operation, huh?
Last time we saw you, it was in a storefront.
Not quite Stern, Lockhart, but we're on our way.
You're walking through a wall.
Oh. Sorry.
We heard Stern, Lockhart was in trouble.
Tammy.
No. We've had a few layoffs, but we're steady now.
Where's all the money coming from?
Insider trading.
Dad's joking.
New corporate clients and a depressed retail market.
What's this?
The world's 14 highest peaks.
Annapurna, Broad Peak, Makalu.
You climbed these?
Two left.
Dad's hobby.
I don't know how it happened--
the outdoorsman sired a homebody.
So, shall we join suits?
I'm all right if we combine lawsuits,
but we really need to combine.
No stabbing in the back.
You represent the union employees, we represent the nonunion.
Yeah. You have something written up?
Over a handshake.
That's how I do everything.
We're junior associates.
We do everything in writing.
Okay.
Federal agents!
Put your hands on your head now!
All right, spread out. Everything goes--
computers, files, every box.
Come on, Rivers.
This is harassment.
No, Eric. This is an arrest.
For what? What did I do?
Maybe you didn't hear.
Hands on your head.
Ma'am.
Come on. These are my lawyers.
They'll have me out in 24 hours.
Not this time.
Okay, okay.
What's the charge this time, Rivers?
First degree murder.
Who did I kill?
Kelli Gerber Smith.
Oh, come on, you lost a case.
When I lose a case, I don't go pee on your lawn.
She was innocent,
and you gave her over to that scum.
Hey, that's ours.
Sir, we are lawyers with Stern, Lockhart & Gardner.
We are not employees of this firm.
And we do not grant you permission to confiscate our work product.
Well, given that I can't distinguish between work product in the field,
I'll segregate the files, and
you can get a court order to have them returned.
No.
What's his name?
AUSA Rivers.
It's federal.
I don't know the cast of characters.
These are my lawyers.
They'll have me out in 24 hours.
What's he saying?
He telling them that we're his lawyers,
and we will get him out in 24 hours.
Uh, you led him to believe that?
No. No. We were there on the furlough lawsuit.
The metro suit. We decided to marry union and nonunion.
So why did Dorfman get arrested for murder?
Well, Dorfman was defending a drug dealer,
and there was this witness testifying for the prosecution,
a Kelli Gerber Smith.
Supposedly, Dorfman gave her name to his client,
the drug dealer, who then had her killed.
Who was the drug dealer?
LeMond Bishop.
Bishop's one of Dorfman's clients?
Uh, he wanted us to take over his ongoing cases,
just while he's being held.
He doesn't have his staff lined up yet.
He also wants us to argue for his release.
He can pay us.
It's a drug case.
First things the Feds will do is freeze his assets.
He can pay us when they're unfrozen.
He seemed good.
Yeah. We'll take it under review.
What was that about?
Either they don't like him, or the rumors are true--
Stern, Lockhart's going down.
Oh, damn it.
And I have student loans.
Alicia?
Your husband.
Yeah, at least you have someone to fall back on.
No, no. No, it's nothing.
I just can't find the tax returns.
And why do you need them?
You know Eli.
He needs to look into anything that can be used against us.
Under my bed
in a box marked, I think, house files.
Good. Thanks.
How are you doing?
Well, I was almost got arrested this morning.
You... What?
Do you know an AUSA named Rivers?
Yeah.
Very intense guy. Out to save the world.
Why, what happened?
He was arresting this other lawyer...
It's a long story, but I almost got caught up in the sweep.
He's a zealot.
Never look a zealot in the eyes.
How are you?
Good.
I made a BLT.
I'm very proud of myself.
You know, this is the closest we've had to a normal conversation.
Yeah. I like it.
Maybe we should talk on the phone more.
Speaking of which, you left your cell phone here.
Will called.
Yeah.
He already got in touch.
Okay, back to work.
Back to work.
I say judges are skins this time.
Hello.
Mr. Gardner, AUSA Rivers.
That's okay. We won't hold it against you.
Suit up.
You phoned.
You wanted your work product back.
Yeah, but at my office.
This is a friendly County game.
You're thinking about taking the Dorfman case.
We would advise against it.
Really? And what else would you advise?
Mr. Gardner, you're having money issues.
You can't afford troubles with the federal courts.
This is like the movies.
You have to threaten me with an audit or something.
Oh, that's the IRS.
It would be a federal crime to influence the IRS.
Guys, I'm being threatened over here.
Can you believe it?
Poor baby.
Mr. Dorfman is in trouble.
He is guilty, and his assets are frozen.
It would be a mistake
to represent him.
Too late. I already am.
As of when?
As of ten seconds ago.
Congratulations, Rivers.
You just won Dorfman an attorney.
This is how it works.
Germs enter the political bloodstream
via anonymous Twitter accounts.
These are picked up by political blogs that...
I'm going to drop that metaphor.
Why? No. No. Keep going. See where it takes you.
There's an anonymous Twitter account out there-- Upriser7.
It's saying things about you and Alicia.
Well, isn't that, uh, to be expected?
Some of them are true.
Like what?
Saint Alicia, as she's called behind her back, is despised
Because of her close connection to boss, Will.
Widely hated, she's given all best cases.
Are we saying that's true?
Alicia and Peter sleep in separate rooms.
"He is in maids quarters.
She's in the master. Not even a real marriage."
So, the danger is that it'll be picked by a political blog,
and then move into the mainstream.
I mean, I can reduce the damage by flooding the zone
with bogus tweets that say the opposite.
Any search engine will be overwhelmed by both.
Wait a minute.
Who knew that we are in separate rooms?
There's also stuff about Mrs. Florrick's work,
her competition for a job,
and her connection with her boss.
What did that one say?
You don't want to read it.
That she's sleeping with him.
All right.
Let's find out who's sending these tweets.
Thank you, Mr. Gardner.
My father is just so thankful.
No problem.
We'll see what we can do.
Yup.
Not my playground.
All rise.
Mr. Rivers, what do we have today?
Several motions on Eric Dorfman, Your Honor.
And I'm sorry to hear about your accident.
Thank you. I got your card.
I imagine you're seeking detention pending trial?
Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Dorfman, in our opinion,
released a witness list to a killer,
and given that there will be vulnerable witnesses in this case,
we ask for pretrial detention.
Your Honor, this is a simple case of harassment.
AUSA Rivers failed to convict
LeMond Bishop on RICO charges
and is now going after his lawyer as retribution.
In your opinion?
Excuse me?
In your opinion?
Yes, in my opinion.
He's trying to subvert the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
Mr. Gardner is prone to hyperbole, Your Honor.
Kelli Gerber Smith offered to testify against
one of the most dangerous kingpins in this country,
and in our opinion,
was brutally tortured and murdered for her troubles.
Your Honor,
the prosecution's evidence is thin at best.
Generic carpet fibers found on the body,
access to a witness list.
That hardly makes Eric Dorfman suspect number one.
In your opinion.
Yes, Your Honor, I'm sorry.
I thought it was obvious, when I speak, it's my opinion,
and when he speaks, it's his.
Oh, boy.
Mister...?
Gardner, Your Honor.
It is equally obvious that I'm a judge,
and yet you continually refer to me as "Your Honor."
All I ask is that you do the same with your opinion,
and remind yourself and the court
that it is in fact your opinion.
Your Honor, if I could return to the facts.
Mr. Dorfman was one of four people to hold the witness list
that was sealed under a court order.
There were carpet fibers found on the tarp covering Ms. Smith's body
that came directly from Mr. Dorfman's law firm.
And in our opinion, he was the only one with anything to gain
if her name got out.
This is a vindictive prosecution and should be treated as such.
In my opinion.
The court disagrees, Mr. Gardner,
and orders pretrial detention.
I'll see you both back here on Wednesday
9:00 A.M. For pretrial motions.
It's their courtyard,
you play by their rules.
They're so cocky.
It's just another courtroom,
and they treat it like St. Peter's.
Didn't we agree to not take this?
No, we agreed to cut the flowers and paper cups.
The least I can do is take the cases I want.
You sure this isn't pride?
Of course, it's pride. What's wrong with pride?
Pride built the pyramids.
And Watergate.
God, those do look fake.
Those are the real ones.
Okay, four people had access to that witness list.
Find out who they were, where it went.
Rivers, the court clerk, Dorfman, the judge.
Good.
Now, did they or anyone around them leak it?
Also let's look at the prosecution's assumptions:
the witness in this original case...
Kelli Gerber Smith.
Are we sure she was even actually murdered
due to the case?
And if she was, did the killers really need the witness list
to know she was going to testify?
How do we find that out?
Go to Bishop.
You want to go ask a drug kingpin
whether he really needed a witness list to kill somebody?
Well, there's probably a better way to put it.
But in theory, he wants his lawyer out, too,
and if he could help steer us towards evidence
that would exonerate Dorfman, that'd be good.
You up for it?
Sure.
Uh, excuse me.
Mr. Bishop?
So you're my lawyer's lawyer?
Actually, she is.
Arms out, ladies.
It's all right.
The lawyers are on our side. Didn't you hear, Tony?
When we were picking sides,
they got the cops; we got the lawyers.
Beautiful horses.
They're not mine.
Rich people need places to board them.
One of your legit businesses?
Hey, I'm all legit these days.
Isn't that right?
It is.
So you wanted help with Dorfman?
Good.
I like him.
Did he show you his rock collection?
I think he just picked those rocks up off the street.
Guy has these rocks from the top peaks from around the world.
Everest?
No, not that one yet.
Mountain climbing never made much sense to me.
Bunch of idiots who just need something to do.
But he's a good lawyer.
And lucky.
We didn't even have to go to trial with that witness dying.
You mean being murdered.
Mr. Dorfman has been accused of leaking the witness's identity,
allowing you to murder her.
Well, as I'm sure you're aware,
he didn't do that because I didn't do that.
Right.
But if you could steer us in the direction of what really happened,
I think that could help Mr. Dorfman.
"What really happened"?
Is there some evidence
that points to the murder happening for other reasons?
Reasons that didn't require the witness list.
I own a chain of six sporting good stores,
four restaurants, ten dry cleaners.
I am a businessman.
So I don't want you making the same mistake as the government,
thinking that, because of the color of my skin, I sell drugs.
Because that would be racism, wouldn't it?
Well, this is an exciting day.
You wanted to come.
So...
here's the thing.
I won't say much,
I won't answer questions,
but Bishop likes Mr. Dorfman,
thinks he got a raw deal.
We do, too.
Rivers found the black SUV that carried this dead witness.
Unfortunately, this SUV was never meant to be discovered,
so it may not be as clean as one would hope.
Was Dorfman ever in this SUV?
Again, if there is any attempt to subpoena
or question myself or Mr. Bishop, we will deny this.
But Rivers found the SUV two weeks ago,
right after the murder, and he's kept it under wraps ever since.
Why?
Keep it out of your hands.
Surprise you at trial.
We would advise you to fight its inclusion.
Talk about a pact with the devil.
We're taking trial advice from killers.
Objection, Your Honor.
This SUV was kept from us intentionally.
The only reason the court knows about it at all
is because we brought it up.
It should be thrown out.
I'll give you some leeway, Rivers. Go ahead.
In addition, Your Honor,
we discovered an impression
made on the console from a hastily written note--
"Gerbre."
This of course was the middle name of the victim,
and as you can see the last two letters were inverted.
This clearly matches the accidental inversion made on the witness list.
We submit it into evidence.
Objection!
Again, Your Honor,
this evidence was intentionally withheld from us,
summarily removed from all exhibit lists,
and should be excluded.
In your opinion.
Yes, in my opinion.
While Mr. Gardner and his white-shoe firm
may have the resources to process evidence expeditiously,
in our opinion, Your Honor,
the federal government does not.
Not according to your own lab's time stamp.
In my opinion,
Mr. Rivers was holding on to this key discovery evidence for weeks,
Your Honor, lying to this court about its very existence.
Mr. Gardner is working with old information,
in our opinion.
I would submit this revision of the evidence room stamp.
Objection.
I'll accept. Continue, Rivers.
Thank you. I would like to name...
Excuse me, Your Honor, I objected.
Yes, I know, Mr. Gardner,
and I accepted Mr. Rivers' evidence.
Yes, but you failed to rule.
My ruling is implicit, Mr. Gardner.
Now, sit down.
No, it isn't, Your Honor.
And I will sit down when you rule.
Would you like to be held in contempt, Mr. Gardner?
No, I would not, Your Honor,
but I would like a ruling on my objection.
You are trying my patience...
I understand that,
Your Honor, but we both know if you don't use the proper
form of "Sustained" Or "Overruled,"
the matter can't later be appealed.
And I was surprised in reviewing your past court cases,
how often you encouraged lawyers to move on
without actually ruling,
therefore avoided having your nonrulings overturned on appeal.
In my opinion.
Mr. Gardner,
I have never been quite so offended in all my years on the bench.
I understand that, Your Honor,
but I still want a ruling.
A ruling I can appeal.
Your Honor,
this evidence is necessary for our prosecution.
A conviction is necessary for your prosecution.
That doesn't make it a worthy argument.
One hour for lunch.
Your Honor...
I said, one hour for lunch.
What the hell was that?
Do you have a map?
Do I have a what?
A map so I can show you where you live.
That, my friend, was a Chicago defense.
Get used to it.
Even if the judge kicks the SUV,
which given my courtroom performance,
isn't all that likely...
Although fun.
we still need to undercut
the carpet fibers from Dorfman's office.
That's the only thing that ties him to the body.
Dorfman's carpet is US Taupe Dream.
It's one of the most common in the country.
Good.
Anything on the witness list?
Yeah.
Two other prosecutors in Rivers' office had access to it.
They were listed on the initial filing
before Rivers took over the case.
I'm data-mining them now to find any connection with Bishop's crew.
All right, Cary, you stay on the carpet.
And, Kalinda, you stay on the data-mining.
And, uh...
I'll go back to my office.
Yes, I do have a home.
Good.
Maybe you should try using it.
Interesting case?
Yes.
May I help you, Mr. Gold?
"Saint Alicia is not just sleeping with her boss,
she is also using him to get promoted."
Upriser7-- a tweet.
About, uh, two hours ago.
About me?
Yes. And Peter.
But mostly you.
At first,
I thought it was intended to derail Peter's campaign,
but then I realized, no... it's about you.
We're just collateral damage.
This is on the Internet?
Yes.
And Ben Smith just linked to it as part of a remainder item,
so it may get wider play.
Please excuse the melodrama,
but do you think there's anybody here who's got it out for you?
Young guy, 12:00?
But would he know that you and Peter are in separate rooms?
That's in here?
Even mentions the name of the moving company that put the bed in.
"Saint Alicia" Doesn't sound like him.
That's the thing about the Internet.
Nobody sounds like they seem.
Want to make a call, Mrs. Florrick?
No, um, I just...
It's...
You know the movers who came out last week to put in the bed?
Your apartment? Yes.
Is there any way Cary could've heard about that?
Heard the movers put in another bed?
Yes.
No.
No, I don't mean on purpose.
I'm discreet, Mrs. Florrick.
Yes, of course.
It's not... it's just, you know, the Bluetooth.
Sometimes you can be near someone...
Never mind. Forget it.
Yes, hello. Um, can you stop Mr. Gold from leaving?
I think he left...
My mistake. Uh, never mind.
Kalinda.
What's up?
Can you come into my office?
Certainly, ma'am.
Can you look inside that bag?
Where did that come from?
I have no idea.
$200,000 and the vague whiff of marijuana.
What did you say to him?
Bishop?
Nothing. We just asked about the murder.
What's up?
And why does it smell like a frat house in here?
Bishop?
Our best guess.
I'll make the call.
It's your retainer.
I didn't know you were hiring.
I'm not.
I need new lawyers.
Don't you already have representation?
In jail.
I need someone now.
Business is piling up.
This is a bit unorthodox.
We represent your current lawyer.
Yes. My experience is lawyers are good
at making the unorthodox orthodox.
Why us?
One of my aides saw him in court.
I was off-script.
Nice touch bringing the black guy.
For your information, I'm an equity partner.
Where you from?
None of your business.
I have a corporation,
a large one,
with a lot of employees.
And they sometimes get into trouble.
I need a firm to look after their interests and mine.
Help me make the best financial and legal decisions.
I pay well. I pay on time.
And I help those who help me.
You have a DUI
involving the Baja Fund CEO.
I could tell you things that would
help you with the arresting officer.
I met your husband once.
Taller than I expected.
Yes, he is tall.
Electronic monitoring's a bitch, isn't it?
They don't validate.
How can they not validate?
They're going to argue about this,
then they're going to say "Yes."
Maybe.
No. No "Maybe"
Money makes things predictable,
so here's your signing bonus:
This Rivers-- I have something.
It isn't the same as Sheffrin-Marks.
You don't even believe that.
How's it different?
You know how many kids died from their asthma medicine?
Oh, my God, the sophistry here is just blinding.
Sheffrin-Marks has white employees in suits.
Bishop's crew has African-American men...
Don't try to sell this on the back of racism!
Sheffrin-Marks didn't set out to murder anyone.
Shane Marx, Paul Din,
Johnathan Graham-- all murderers.
Accused murderers.
Now who's the sophist?
We're not in a court of law, Diane.
It's just you and me.
We represent murderers.
We get them off.
No. We keep the courts honest.
And why shouldn't the courts be kept honest about Bishop?
Everybody deserves representation.
Does that stop suddenly when it comes to...
A criminal organization
whose sole purpose is to sell drugs
and to murder to control territory?
Sure. Put it any way you want, it's still a true statement.
We're doing this for the money.
Of course we are.
We're not a charity.
We do this or we lay off half of Acquisitions.
That's ten lawyers and ten families.
Not to mention your season tickets.
I'm sorry.
He gave a parting piece of information about Rivers.
What?
Rivers was sleeping with Kelli Gerber Smith,
the murdered witness.
Objection, Your Honor.
Overruled.
How's that, Mr. Gardner? Do you approve of that?
I do. Thank you, Your Honor.
So, if there are no more pretrial motions
maybe we can move this along.
Actually, the defense requests that AUSA Rivers be disqualified
as prosecution's representative.
On what grounds?
That's my question, Mr. Rivers.
Yes, Your Honor.
On what grounds, Mr. Gardner?
Your Honor,
this is a signed affidavit from the clerk
at the Lake Avenue Motel saying that Mr. Rivers
spent the night with Kelli Gerber Smith
on nine occasions.
Relevance, Your Honor?
Your Honor, do I even need to respond?
Is this true, Counselor?
Uh, Your Honor...
Answer the question, Mr. Rivers.
Yes.
But I assure Your Honor that it will in no way affect
my ability to prosecute this case.
Motion denied, Mr. Gardner.
However, I am reconsidering the SUV.
How did you find that out?
How? Inside source.
Too bad it didn't disqualify Rivers.
We didn't want it to.
It undercut the judge's trust in Rivers
and got her to kick the SUV.
Cary.
Do you have a second?
Sure. What's up?
Are you tweeting about me?
Am I tweeting about you?
Are you Upriser7?
What are you talking about?
Someone's gossiping online about me.
And you thought it was me?
Yeah.
Yeah, thanks. Yeah, it's good to be working with you, too.
Hello?
In here, hon.
How was work?
Where's...?
In the shower. Kids are in bed.
I let them watch a little TV.
Have you ever seen When a Stranger Calls?
The movie?
A long time ago. Hmm.
We just traced the IP address for the last anonymous tweet.
And?
It's coming from inside the house.
No, just a bit of an emergency.
Rivers found another way to get the SUV in.
Through the GPS.
So I'll need you to come in. Sorry.
No, it's all right.
Um, I'll probably be half an hour.
Great. Thanks.
No problem.
Is that Will?
Yes. I have to go back in.
So what do you think?
I don't know.
Maybe one of them is angry.
Either about me running again or...
Or me at work.
Yeah.
Do you really think it's possible that our children would do that?
It's crazy, Peter.
Maybe someone was using our Wi-Fi without us knowing?
Eli's checking it.
But we still have to talk to them.
I'll do it.
Tomorrow.
All-nighter?
No, just a few more hours.
I found condoms in your bedside table.
I was looking for your letter opener.
I thought maybe they belonged to Zach.
You know, you found them in his room.
But then I thought, you wouldn't take them.
You'd have a sensible conversation with him about responsibility.
So then, I thought they were yours.
But that didn't make sense because you have an IUD.
I had it removed.
Oh, really?
So condoms do make sense?
They do.
For who?
Check it, Peter.
I said I was looking for your letter opener.
I have other drawers, too.
Did you check these ones?
I said that I was looking...
How about over here?
Did you check this drawer?
What is it you need to hear from me?
I will never touch another woman again.
What do you want, a prize, Peter?
It seems to be the minimum prerequisite.
For both of us.
Then trust me.
Then don't go to work tonight.
Trust me.
But the GPS isn't the same as the SUV in our opinion.
It's contained in the SUV in my opinion.
But the data is separate and tracked through satellite imaging...
Which is only accessed through the SUV, which was thrown out!
Your Honor, the GPS shows
this SUV drove right from Mr. Dorfman's office
to the site where the body was dumped on the night of the murder.
You have no proof my client was in the SUV
or at his office at those times!
This isn't about Mr. Dorfman pulling the trigger.
We don't need to prove that, Your Honor, in our opinion.
This is about whether or not he was complicit in the witness' death.
And the inference is that...
Was the GPS factory installed?
What? I don't know.
How is that relevant, Mr. Gardner?
If the GPS was installed at the factory, it should be considered
part of the automobile regardless of whether or not the tracking
information was pulled from satellite technology.
The GPS was manufactured by Botheon, Incorporated, Your Honor.
Not General Motors.
A separate corporate entity
that uses separate satellites that gather information.
Therefore, we should be able to introduce this information into evidence.
Overruled, Mr. Gardner.
The GPS data is allowed into evidence.
We're still looking for ways to undercut the GPS,
but we need to know:
Were you at your law office that night?
The night of the murder? Yes.
But you didn't talk to or see any of the Bishop crew?
No.
Then why were they at your office?
Because this GPS has them at your office.
I don't know. They could've been parked there for all we know.
All "we" Know? Who's we?
We.
Dad and me.
You were there?
Yes.
Okay, we'll try to do what we can to undercut the GPS.
Thanks.
Mrs. Florrick.
Could you stay a minute?
No, Tammy. We're fine.
Your daughter had access to the witness list and she leaked it to Bishop.
Why?
To win the case?
I had a struggling firm.
She wanted to show Bishop we could handle his business.
And you, you knew?
Well, then that's your defense.
No.
You even think of using her to free me, and I'll confess.
She's not my client.
I am your client and I will confess.
Eric, this... I don't think you understand.
With that information, Bishop will kill her.
No. He knows if he moves against her,
I'll tell Rivers everything.
I've got some files socked away,
and attorney-client privilege be damned.
Then what are you going to do?
Because if I found out your daughter leaked the witness list,
Rivers can't be far behind.
Will you take a message to Bishop for me?
It's not a big deal.
I won't have a talk.
No scolding, no mothering, just...
I want to know.
Well, I don't tweet.
Y-you guys think that...?
Mom, this is stupid.
Don't say "stupid."
There were two IP addresses used:
the Internet at your school and here.
I can't believe this.
This is like a police state.
Don't be melodramatic.
I'm asking you a question.
No, you're not.
You're not saying "No."
Grace, don't.
You didn't do this?
You didn't write these things?
Mom!
What?
Let's at least pretend
we know what happened here the last six months.
That was different.
We didn't tell you about the pictures,
because they were trying to hurt you.
It was a lie, Zack.
And not one.
It was over and over again.
But a lie like lying about having Jews in your basement.
You know, like, with the Nazis.
Let's trust each other again.
My defenses are down.
Let's go. Just tell me.
I told you.
He did it.
That's the way he and Becca talk all the time.
Uh, not really how I wanted it to, but...
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I don't know...
Becca?
She's still in class.
Will you excuse us, ladies?
It's okay.
Have you got a problem?
That depends, Upriser7?
Oh, so what are you, like, the Internet police?
No, just an interested bystander
who wants to protect his six-figure income.
So, you and Zack talk a lot.
He talks a lot about his parents, is that it?
Oh, no.
Have I been a bad girl?
No,
Dear Becca, because that would only
make you want to do it again.
You know what you've been?
Gum on the bottom of my shoe.
Spoiled little brat who will get pregnant at 17,
have an abortion at 18
and meet some sweaty frat boy over spring break,
and work as a dental hygienist until the day you die.
And you...
you're a perv.
You better get your story straight, perv.
Oh, Mr. Gold. I'm sorry.
Don't worry, Officer.
Just a daughter of a friend of mine.
She's all right now.
Aren't you, Becca?
I'm good.
See, I have a lot of friends,
I'm sure you do, too, but only difference is,
my friends are not in homeroom.
So I want you to listen to me.
Stop tweeting.
If you tweet,
I will know you tweet and I will...
Have you seen Drag Me to Hell?
It will be just like that.
Do you understand?
I want to hear the words.
I understand.
Good. And enjoy high school.
It really is the best time of your life.
This way, gentlemen.
My name is Tony Gurstelle,
and I am guiltyof the murder of Kelli Gerber...
He's surrendering himself freely!
Get out of my way!
I acted alone and with no consultation from anybody else.
I had no access to the witness list
or any other information other than my own.
I don't have anything further to add...
What kind of deal did you make?
You got your murderer.
Come on, what kind of deal did you make with Bishop?
Do you expect an answer? Really?
What kind of deals do you make every day?
With drug dealers, killers?
I am in pursuit of the good.
You're in pursuit of your own sanctity.
Take your suspect.
He killed your girlfriend.
You won.
You wake up with fleas, Counselor.
You pay your rent,
you go to your restaurants,
but you still wake up with fleas.
I'm firing you.
No reflection on your work.
I just feel more comfortable with Dorfman.
And keeping the evidence he has on you secret?
Well, that doesn't hurt.
Good work on his defense, by the way.
Good work on your deal.
Dorfman keeps everything he knows under wraps
and you turn over the murderer.
Well, we only ended up there because of your defense.
Look, we can work with Dorfman and share your business.
No, thanks.
I need an up-and-comer.
Someone who's hungry.
You don't think we're hungry?
Not like Dorfman.
Guy's a mountain climber.
Sorry it didn't work out.
So, I'm pitching our firm to this drug dealer.
I'm telling him we'll validate for parking again.
They don't teach you that at law school.
And he said, no.
He said he looked at our financials
and he thinks we have a year left.
So what are we going to do?
I don't know.
Lay off Acquisitions?
Or split up.
Do you want that?
It's an option.
I take my people, you take yours.
Or we could shop for another drug dealer.
Hey, they're the only ones making money these days.
Or find a third partner.
How does that work?
Find a replacement for Stern.
Bring him in as equal partner.
Somebody with a client list, some equity.
You're okay with giving up a third?
Of what, a sinking ship?
Sure.
We'll kill each other if we don't find a referee.
A third partner?
Someone neutral, someone we both agree on?
An optimism fills the void.
I think that's alcohol.
Just as good.
You sure?
Yeah.
Come on. Let's go before I change my mind.
Just wait.
Come on. Let's go.
Just one second.
