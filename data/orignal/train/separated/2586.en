My baby.
Please.
They have him. They...
Please. My baby. They have -- have him.
Please. Please.
Please. They -- they have my baby.
They took my baby.
B-b-b-back away, ma'am.
They took my baby. They -- - Please, please back away.
Calm down, ma'am. Calm down.
What's -- what's happening? - They took my baby.
What's happening? Who took -- who took your baby?
They have my baby. - What's -- what's happening?
Hey, Kate.
Oh, thank God. I was so worried.
What baby, ma'am?
She's confused. I'm so sorry, officer.
Wait. Do you know this woman?
Yes, I-I do. I do.
She's my sister. She has-- she hasn't been well.
Don't move. I want you two to stay right there.
Officer?
I'm sorry.
第一季 第十三集
I'm in love with his little nose.
Yeah, that's a cute one.
Oh, it's his face, and I'm in love with him.
Oh, my God. It just got real.
Yeah. Are we really doing this?
I think we are.
Are you a little freaked out?
Yeah, a little, but in a good way, right?
Yeah.
Right.
You figure out how to use the stroller
and the car seat, the base thingy?
I think you just gave me a honey-do list, which --
Wait. You're officially a mom.
You know, um...
I've decided I want to stay home for a little while,
spend some time with the baby and --
Are you serious? Can you do that?
I mean, aren't you -- uh, you could lose your job.
This is more important.
There's nothing more profound and of lasting consequence
than the decision to have a child.
The exploitation and perversion of that decision
is the stock and trade of a truly evil organization --
the Cyprus adoption agency.
Adoption?
You want me to believe this is a coincidence?
Tom and I are adopting a baby,
and you serve up an adoption agency?
Life is full of lovely little ironies.
The Cyprus Agency offers a promise
of something very special -- perfection.
Their clients are ordering from an unlimited genetic menu,
the characteristics of the child they want to bring home.
But the evil is not in what the agency offers.
It's in how they get it done.
Our business is probability.
All the children available for adoption
have some genetic advantage.
I'm Owen. Owen Mallory. Hi.
Mr. Mallory is our founder and C.E.O.
Adoption is a big decision.
That's why we try to make it as simple as we possibly can.
You select your preferences.
We scour the planet for a child that matches that criteria.
Oh, this is, um, Ted Caldwell.
The Martins, from Montreal.
Ted's our general counsel.
The Cyprus agency is in the abduction business.
They don't locate kids for adoption.
They steal them and adopt them out to new parents.
And moving stolen children is difficult.
There's copious amounts of paperwork.
They're using a forger.
One of the best.
But I'm biased. He's one of my best.
Lizzy, I'm giving you the chance
to take down a criminal organization
that is abducting babies from their mothers' arms.
This is the next child the Cyprus Agency will deliver,
a boy, less than two weeks from now.
Who is he really?
I have no idea.
But he's about to become
the child of David and Wendy Roland.
So, where did he come from?
I don't know.
Our source says he may have been abducted.
Oh, my God.
Abduction? Abducted from whom?
Y-you're saying he may never be our son?
W-we've been through all the details.
What, y-you're saying there may be another mother out there
who's looking for him?
S-so, what do you need us to do?
I just want to take a moment
to congratulate you.
I know how excited you both are
and how long a road this has been.
Someone from our nursing staff will be reaching out
to make arrangements for you and the baby to meet.
Do you have a question?
No.
Just -- we've heard about birth parents
changing their mind at the last minute.
Just want to make sure everything's accurate.
Rest assured. Your case, like every case...
He's gonna spook him.
He's got to ask about the adoption.
Our agency does exhaustive
preparation and research that involves a large network
of the most reputable contacts both here and overseas.
Your agency said he came from an orphanage in Estonia.
Can you tell us anything more about that?
Such as?
Well, I-I don't know. You hear stories --
what these kids went through before they found a home.
Oh. No, no, no.
I assure you, you have nothing to worry about.
Now, as the agency's lawyer,
I'm not involved with the children directly.
But... well, maybe you could give us
the name of someone in the agency who is.
You should absolutely feel free to speak
with one of our adoption consultants.
Would you...excuse me? I have to take this phone call.
I think we have a situation here.
They're asking questions about Estonia.
That's it. We got him. Move. Move. Move.
No. No, it just feels funny.
I don't think they're onto anything,
Theodore Caldwell?
Excuse me?
FBI.
No, no, no.
We need to talk.
FBI? About what? Talk about what? This is a misunderstanding.
We know about the abduction.
What abduction?!
You can do the right thing here.
You can help us.
You don't understand.
You can help us. Tell us about the agency.
No loose ends. I'm already dead.
Help us find the real parents.
Real parents?
Oh, my God. You have no idea.
I'm -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
The truth is, the Cypress Agency is--
She's a tough little Punjab.
Doesn't talk so much.
That's why you're here, Mr. Brimley.
She's telling the truth.
Don't bet the trailer money, but I pushed her hard,
and I'm telling you -- that girl's cleaner than a duck fart.
Thank you, Teddy.
Let's talk.
Already did.
Yes, but now that you've been vetted by Mr. Brimley,
I'm more inclined to listen.
Like I said, to get into the black site so quickly,
Garrick had to have the site layout in advance.
Which you gave to him.
No.
I have an RFP we recovered from the trash
of a government contractor, signed by Meera Malik.
You leak classified data in the name of improving security.
No. I was authorized to start the bidding process.
Authorized by whom?
I don't know.
All I know is that Cooper handed me the order.
Putting a bullet in my head gets you nothing.
But letting me help you might get us both what we want.
And why would you want to help me, Agent Malik?
Someone on the inside betrayed us.
Colleagues of mine were killed.
We both want the same thing.
Let me go, and I'll find out who did it.
The order was classified.
You let me worry about that.
You can't.
Those files are confidential.
Warrant. I need you to step outside.
Get that hard drive to Aram.
We need a full work-up on it, pronto.
Agent Ressler?
Mr. Mallory.
I see you got my message.
I did.
I just -- I don't really understand.
I...
Neither do we.
But it's clear an adoption
being brokered by this agency is a fraud.
Well, I-I can't believe that.
If there was a misstep with a case,
it undoubtedly happened overseas.
All of the legal aspects on our end are dealt with
by Ted Caldwell and his team,
who I am completely confident in.
Someone got it wrong.
All right, Agent.
You're welcome to examine all the records, warrant or not,
but if there was a false claim made, believe me --
you should be looking into our overseas partners.
We're launching a wider investigation.
Until we're done, you're out of the adoption business.
Understood. I just ordered an internal review myself.
Look, this agency is only as strong as its reputation,
so I want answers as much as you do.
Anything you need -- anything -- just let me know.
27 files.
That's 27 adoptions brokered in the last 3 years alone.
Is that a lot?
That's a lot,
Especially when you're adopting out infants,
and that's almost never done internationally.
But there's the thing. I've gone through every case file.
I can't authenticate a single adoption.
One child was supposedly born to a birth mother in Lithuania,
but I can't find any record of the birth.
They're smart. The trails lead to facts we can't verify
instead of something we can prove is a lie.
Bring me evidence. Make the case.
Compare the kids delivered by the Cypress Agency
to police reports of missing kids.
I'll call Interpol, check their database.
A lot of their missing-persons files have DNA on record.
We should coordinate DNA panels on all the kids.
Let's do it.
Sir?
I wanted to talk with you about something.
It's a personal matter.
Good of you to join us.
Sir, rough night. My daughter was sick.
I agreed to let you join this task force with the promise
that family wouldn't be an issue.
I don't mean to be a hard-ass,
but in this unit, job comes first, second, and third.
Bring her up to speed.
You wanted to talk to me about something?
It can wait.
The FBI is looking into the Cypress Agency.
There have been some allegations.
And that's why we're asking for DNA.
We can confirm -- say, "Ah." Good girl --
that she is who the agency claims she is.
I know this is hard. I have a daughter myself.
And you have every right to speak to a lawyer.
But we have a court order authorizing us to collect DNA.
Here, open up. I promise this won't hurt.
It's okay. It's okay, honey.
There you go. That's my boy.
Very good boy.
Aww, you did it. Mommy's got you.
I think this will be my last case for awhile.
I'm gonna spend some time at home,
be with the baby.
How's the case coming along?
We compared the DNA to every known sample on file
for missing or abducted kids -- not a single hit.
The Cyprus Agency delivered 27 children,
all unaccounted for.
Nobody's ever reported them missing.
You're so linear.
What's that supposed to mean?
The FBI and the police --
the way they teach you to think never ceases to amaze me.
Lizzy, not every missing child
is on the back of a milk carton.
Who wouldn't report a missing child?
People who won't or can't go to the police.
Criminals.
Run the DNA again.
This time, don't look for an exact match.
Look at the relatives.
You want to find where those kids came from, that's how.
You're arriving at a point of no return, Lizzy.
If you have any doubts about your husband,
you can't go through with this adoption.
When you get there,
if there is even one shred of doubt --
There isn't.
Keen, the DNA results are in.
We get a hit?
We got five. You need to see this.
Five hits, all women.
According to the DNA, these five women
are the biological mothers of 12 of the 27 kids.
The mothers.
Let me guess. They're in prison.
No.
They're not in the system because they're criminals --
they're in the system because they're missing.
Missing?
All five of them.
Five women --
all attractive, smart, in their early 20s.
All five were in college when they disappeared.
Four of the five disappeared without a trace.
Allison Hayes --
she was a physics student at B.U.
She went to class one Monday morning and vanished.
The police reports are almost identical.
These were clean grabs, no witnesses.
All except one.
Kate Ellison, also 20.
She goes drinking with a fake I.D. at a bar near Brown
when she's a sophomore.
She got taken on the walk home.
A witness said they saw her fighting with a man
who then pushes her into a van,
but no I.D. was possible.
So, they're not taking children. They're taking women.
What's the timeline?
Kate Ellison was taken three years ago.
Wait. That can't be right.
According to the DNA test, Kate's the mother
of two children delivered by the Cyprus Agency.
They're 1 and 2 years old.
So she gave birth after she was taken?
She didn't only give birth.
She got pregnant after she was taken.
So did Allison Hayes...
and Michelle Lefferts.
The kids matching their DNA
were conceived after they were abducted.
These women are alive. They're still out there.

You need something?
It's about the mole hunt.
What about it?
Reddington's been speaking to Keen.
He believes that someone in our unit
provided the intruders with intel critical to the breach.
Counter intelligence has concluded
that Newton Phillips acted alone.
You disagree?
I'm feeling very mistrustful.
Do you have actionable intel to support this... hunch?
No.
Malik...
I hope your daughter feels better.
You are looking at Ted Caldwell's computer,
the one we seized from his office.
Now, most of it was routine,
but deep in the background
was a file nobody wanted found.
"Purchase orders." What exactly was he buying?
Not buying. From the looks of it,
I'd say it's something he intended to acquire.
I had them printed.
It's a complete dossier -- medical profile,
grades going back to middle school,
athletic and extracurricular interests.
Charlotte Patterson -- in her second year at Georgetown.
You think she could be the agency's next target?
We can't afford to risk it.
We need to get her into protective custody.
I just talked to the university.
She's in a chemistry class at Regents Hall
until 5:00 p.m.
Move. Move.
Class is dismissed. She's gone.
Give me something, Aram.
Her car's still there.
She swiped in at the parking structure near campus,
hasn't swiped out.
Keen, Keen, car.
Oh, geez. We've got her books.
In the van! Step out!
Mandell parking garage, shots fired!
There's a kidnapped suspect in a blue van!
Virginia plate -- 8-1, Sam, Echo, Michael, 3-6!
You okay?
You call me at the office?
You didn't answer the cell. I tried you half a dozen times.
Perry, the cell is retired.
We went dark. You recall?
No business.
They're onto me.
The last pickup, the feds were there.
How did they know the target?
Why are you out making pickups when I said to hold off?
On new orders, but this was old business.
We lost one the other day.
The lawyer told me to get a replacement.
You should have checked with me first.
Where is she?
She's in the van, sedated.
Okay. Show me.
The lawyer said to get a replacement.
The lawyer's dead.
Charlotte Patterson never made it home from class.
She was definitely inside that van.
Her cell's not active. We're setting up checkpoints,
and every law-enforcement agency
in a 200-mile radius has her photo,
along with the make, model, and plate number of the van.
Where are we on Mallory?
Waiting on documents from overseas.
And the files we seized at the agency
have Caldwell's name all over them.
But there's no paper trail
proving Mallory or anyone else knew what was going on.
Are you saying he's innocent?
No.
We've interviewed employees on three continents --
accountants, marketing, researchers.
They all seem to be clean.
We need proof!
And it would be nice to get it before another woman is abducted.
Where are we?
That's my question for you.
What's with the new girl? I thought we were done.
We are. She was a mistake.
The FBI is looking at everyone.
Well, there's no link to my clinic.
We were very careful.
I don't care. Shut it down.
What happened the other day? Perry said we lost one.
Couldn't be avoided. Perry took care of it.
Flounder!
Hey, where did you go, bud?
Hey, Flounder, what have you got there?
Name is Kate Ellison.
Computer said the FBI is looking for her.
Thanks for the call.
You get a cause of death?
Single gunshot wound.
And that's about the only thing in this that makes any sense.
Just h-hang on a second. Let me get my file.
What are you thinking?
Nothing good.
Kate Ellison had blond hair and blue eyes.
She dies, and a day or two later,
Charlotte Patterson gets taken.
It's the same type.
Maybe the agency needed a replacement.
Okay, Kate Ellison, abducted at the age of 20.
She dies at the age of 23.
So, where has she been for the last three years?
I would say nowhere.
Meaning?
Let's start with the muscle tone.
She has severe muscular atrophy.
Her arms, her legs,
all the major muscle groups are deteriorated.
What would cause that?
Inactivity -- I don't think that this woman
has stood upright for any length of time in years.
She was in an induced coma.
The needle marks on her arm suggest
that she was fed through a tube.
Okay, now, here's where my findings go
from the crazy to the totally insane.
She's given birth -- several times.
How is that possible in her condition, though?
Well, she was heavily sedated
and she's lost a lot of muscle mass,
but she's actually in great shape to deliver a child.
Her folic acid, her calcium, her iron were all incredibly high.
So, whoever's been keeping her
has been giving her prenatal care.
If she was shot, maybe she was trying to escape.
That would be pretty tough.
She was on some very heavy sedation --
a benzodiazepine called hydroxipam.
Thank you.
Aram, what do you have?
It's about Owen Mallory. Cooper said get into his life,
so I started with his undergrad degree from Harvard.
Oh, let me guess. He never went.
Oh, no, he went.
Here's the thing -- he went under a different name.
Owen Mallory was enrolled as Charles Lassiter JR.
He falsified his transcripts, applied as the only son
of Charles and Jill Lassiter from Bethesda.
We've got something on Mallory.
Aram, send us the Lassiters' address.
I know this must be a shock.
His name is Owen Mallory.
He attended Harvard, claiming to be your son.
I'm sorry. What did you say his name is now?
"Now"? Mrs. Lassiter, do you know this man?
He was our son.
The boy we knew was named Michael Shaw.
And when we met him,
he was 7 years old and in foster care.
So you adopted him.
He was with us for 16 months.
Charles and I --
I mean, we knew Michael was troubled.
But nothing could have prepared us for...
T-the therapist called it severe attachment disorder.
Uh... A-and there -- there --
there were many therapists, all kinds.
We tried.
I know -- I know how that sounds.
But -- but when Michael began threatening
to hurt himself and -- and us,
then the doctors stepped in and felt...
...for, uh...
for Michael to return... to foster care.
I'm so sorry. That must have been very difficult.
No, I'm sorry.
It's just, in many ways...
Charles and I blame ourselves.
In hindsight, we weren't ready. We...
the marriage was troubled.
We -- we just weren't equipped for a child.
Directive for a mandatory security upgrade.
The person who ordered it signed page 6.
Our business is done, Agent Malik.
Sorry I'm late.
What the hell is this place?
Not at all what it seems.
What are we doing here?
I told you -- I need help tracking hydroxipam.
There's no federal prescription database.
I can't subpoena every pharmacy on the east coast.
You don't have to.
Did you know the earliest-known cul-de-sac
is over 2,000 years old,
unearthed in El-Lahun, Egypt?
Aristotle himself was a big fan --
said they made it difficult
for the enemy to find their way while attacking.
Now, be polite. You're about to meet
one of the nicest narcotics dealers this side of Cleveland.
Russell.
Red. What's up, fool?
Smells delicious, Russell.
Mescaline steam bath.
You want a hit?
Oh, my God.
If only I could do just one. No, thank you.
No, last time I played around with that,
I ended up naked in the desert
trying to hitch a ride to Tuba City.
Those navajo tacos -- oh! Heaven!
When was this?
Uh, about two years ago.
She seems like a cop.
Thank you.
You see? I keep telling her that.
She doesn't listen to me.
Listen, Russell, this isn't a social call.
I came for your professional opinion.
I need to know about hydroxipam.
Sure, yeah, I know all about that --
That and the betamax and the blackberry.
I don't understand the reference.
Nobody wants it.
Uh, hydro is supposed to be a sleep aid,
but it's crazy powerful -- too powerful.
The half-life's like 100 hours.
So?
So, people need to get up in the morning.
Where can I get it?
You don't want it.
I do.
Okay.
But I got to tell you,
I don't think most pharmacies even stock it now.
Luckily, I have access to their inventories.
There. See?
Only three pharmacies in 1,200 miles carry hydro.
And of those, only eight doctors wrote scripts in the last year.
What's this code here?
That's what kind of doctor wrote the prescription.
Looks like seven are sleep therapists, and one...
is a fertility doctor.
FBI. We need to talk with Dr. Gideon Hadley.
Dr. Hadley's in a meeting.
You'll just have to interrupt.
I'm not sure waiting is such a --
What have...
FBI. They're asking for you.
If there are loose ends, they are not on my side.
Take it easy, everybody.
They don't know anything.
They're just here to talk.
If they knew something, they would have sent a S.W.A.T. team.
Talk to them.
Be your charming self. Get them to leave.
By the time they get back,
there won't be anything for them to find.
And if I can't?
Take care of it, Nestor.
I'm so sorry.
Dr. Hadley actually stepped out for the afternoon.
I thought you said he was in a meeting.
I thought he was. He'll be back in a few hours.
You're welcome to wait.
Great.
In the meantime,
I think we'll give ourselves a tour of the facility.
Find Hadley.
Keen.
I'm okay.
Call it in.
22 victims, all alive,
including Charlotte Patterson,
the girl we lost at Georgetown.
Allison Hayes and Michelle Lefferts --
We got them all.
Except Kate Ellison.
You solved all those missing-persons reports in one case.
And the mothers of every one of those 27 kids have been accounted for.
Sir, there's a complete IVF laboratory.
The women's eggs were surgically retrieved,
fertilized here, and then re-transferred.
It's all state-of-the-art.
The genetic testing is cutting-edge.
It's remarkable. Some of the charts go back years.
Well done.
We found Kate Ellison.
And I'm guessing that's not the only body
we'll find before this is done.
Is it...Michael?
We know who you are.
Michael Shaw...
adopted at 7 by Charles and Jill Lassiter
and returned to foster care 16 months later.
Owen Mallory has no record, but...
Michael Shaw -- he's quite a con man, isn't he?
Thank you.
You must have felt so rejected, being removed --
I wasn't removed.
I was returned...
Like a defective toy.
I met the Lassiters.
Is that why you did this?
To get back at them?
The Lassiters didn't want a child.
They wanted an accessory to smile for their Christmas card.
They wanted perfection,
like all the others.
So I sell what people want.
Everybody wins.
They get their little geniuses, and--
And you and your employees get rich?
No.
Well, yes.
But it's not about the money for me.
What does that mean?
I think I've said enough.
But my legacy is complete.
And there is nothing you can do to change that.
Your legacy.
You're the father.
The children brokered by the Cyprus Agency are yours.
Why?
Well, I was damaged goods, wasn't I?
Not fit to survive in their privileged world.
Well, I am surviving.
Now part of me is thriving in every home
that has my child.
Honey?
What's wrong?
Are you okay?
I can't do it.
Do what?
You're not ready.
We're not ready.
No, look-- you don't have to take any time off, all right?
Just-- there's a lot of working moms out there,
and you can do both.
No.
You can do both.
Tom...
It's us.
It's us.
I don't know what's wrong.
I don't understand it, but something's not right.
I can't have a baby right now.
Well, I don't know what to say to that.
Honey, you can't tell me that there's not one shred of doubt,
one shred that wonders...
if this is...
broken.

What the hell are you doing in my house?
I know, Diane.
What?
You signed a directive
ordering a mandatory security upgrade at the post office.
It's how you got the blueprints into enemy hands.
You're the dirty rat, Diane.
I'm calling the police.
No, you're not.
You stupid son of a bitch.
Sit your ass down.
I signed that directive for your protection.
You remind me of this woman I knew in Lisbon.
Strange old bird.
If you think Fitch or any of his people
are going to let you get away with this,
you're more arrogant than I thought.
We came into the post office to make a point.
If you come after me,
if you so much as lay a finger on me --
You talk too much.
You can't shoot me.
Why not?
You're not one of the good guys.
And, as of today, you're utterly worthless to the bad guys.
Fitch and I have an agreement.
He goes about his business. I go about mine.
You and I don't have an agreement.
I know the truth, Red...
about that night...
about what happened to your family.
Do you want to know the truth?
More than anything in the world.
But if you know the truth, Diane,
then somebody else does, too.
