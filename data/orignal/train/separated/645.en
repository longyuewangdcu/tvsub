When I was a little girl,
my understanding of revenge was
as simple as the Sunday School proverb that hid behind.
Neat little morality slogans, like,
"Do unto others"
and "Two wrongs don't make a right."
But two wrongs can never make a right
because two wrongs can never equal each other.
纽约州 南汉普顿
For the truly wronged...
real satisfaction can only be found
in one of two places...
Absolute forgiveness...
or mortal vindication.
This is not a story about forgiveness.
Emily.
I've been looking for you. Where's Daniel?
Uh, he's walking the beach. We're having a thing.
Same thing or different thing?
Same thing. But don't worry. He's right behind me.
It's my job to worry.
Your job is to enjoy yourself.
It's your engagement party.
Can someone get me a twenty on Daniel Grayson?
Hey, congrats, Emily.
Thank you.
Nice night for it.
Nice night for what, Nolan?
Celebrating.
You shouldn't be here.
That makes two of us.
Emily, where have you been hiding?
Come on. Let's see that ring, girl.
I feel like a jackass in this tux.
Well, stop acting like one,
and you'll stop feeling like one.
Trust me. If your friends could see you now--
I'd probably get jumped.
Hey, you really want outta that tux?
Come on. We'll run away together.
You're slow.
I'm going. I'm going.
Little too much food lately.
Come on.
Maybe not.
Where are we going?
You ask too many questions.
Show me what you got, bad boy.
Here. Let me help you.
I got it. I got it.
Fire and ice...
When we first sat down to discuss tonight's occasion,
I was immediately taken with the idea
of an evening inspired by primal bookends--
Fire and ice...
Beginnings and endings...
And the love between a man and a woman.
Yo. Yo, 8 mile,
Private party here!
...A starry evening.
That creep better not be taking pictures.
You got a problem?!
Tonight not only marks the final weekend
of a remarkable summer in the hamptons,
it is also the celebration of my son Daniel's engagement...
to the lovely and beguiling Ms. Emily Thorne.
And though we've only known her for a few short months,
Emily already feels like the piece of the family puzzle
we never even knew was missing.
In a word,
I approve.
And as anyone can tell you,
approval is not something I give away freely.
Where the hell is my son?
Charlotte.
Oh, my god.
Mom!
Mom!
My brother... Somebody come here!
Come here!
Mom!
Daniel!
Daniel!
Daniel!
Get away from my son!
Daniel!
Daniel, please! No!
Daniel!
I can't tell you what a rare opportunity you have here, Ms. Thorne.
The current owners live in the city, of course,
but they've been loyal hamptonites for years.
Perhaps if Mr. Davis had been a bit more loyal to his wife,
they wouldn't be renting out this season.
Word has it, he dumped her for a girl half his age.
Men.
You mind if I look around a bit?
That's what we're here for.
Dad?
Hey, kiddo. You having fun exploring?
We really get to spend the whole summer here?
And every summer after that.
What do you think?
I think mom would've loved it.
Hey, you know how much I love you, Amanda?
Infinity?
Well, infinity...
times infinity.
Ms. Thorne?
Now you have to imagine,
It's memorial day weekend,
75 and sunny,
All those boys of summer wondering who the new girl is.
And that's Grayson Manor.
You won't find a better address than this.
I'll take it.
Oh. Wonderful.
I'll get the contract.
Hello, hello.
Ashley, hey.
What do you think?
Are you kidding? Look at this place.
I want your life.
You love your life.
Yeah, you're right. I just want your money.
What's mine is yours. Should I get us some glasses?
I wish. It's for victoria grayson.
Who...?
You're hopeless.
Victoria Grayson--
Reigning queen of the hamptons.
Not to mention, your new next door neighbor.
Queen victoria?
Mm. Believe me, she's earned the title.
My boss has me handling the guest list
for her memorial day party.
If I screw this up, I might as well move back to Croydon.
Well, how much are the tickets?
10,000 a pop.
Count me in for one.
Are you sure?
It's for a good cause, right?
Yeah, my career. Thank you.
You want to get drunk on cheap margaritas later?
With or without you.
Good luck with her highness.
Bye.
Let's dump our long position on 5- and 10-year treasuries
before the Feds stops buying them up.
And, uh, get us into some of those low-rated tech bonds. Thanks
Looks like Lydia and Michael's new renter is settling in.
Lucky girl, scoring that property.
Pretty one, too,
even from up here.
I guess that makes her doubly lucky.
I don't believe in luck.
I thought you were taking the weekend off.
There. I'm off.
Ew. Get a room, you guys.
Oh, I'm sorry, Charlie. I didn't see you sneaking in.
Didn't see you sneaking out last night, either, Charlotte.
I went over to Tracey's.
Told you I was going before you went to bed.
No, you didn't.
Mom, you're too young and too pretty to be this senile.
Remind me to buy her a cat bell.
Aw, let her have a little fun.
She got straight A's this year.
No one's accusing her of being stupid.
Don't think I didn't see you eyeballing that case of beer, Dec.
Our dad owns a bar, dumbass.
I can get as much beer as I want.
All right. Well, in that case,
I'll just have to make sure
dad double-checks the inventory while I'm gone.
Why don't you tell me another hundred times, huh?
Did you already wash those garbage bins out back?
Beats uploading this future shipwreck.
Ahoy! Captain Porter.
Welcome back, Nolan. What can I do for you?
Need a boat for the summer.
This one will do.
It's not for rent.
Who said anything about renting?
How much you want for..."Amanda"?
It's not for sale, either.
I'm taking it down to Haiti next week.
I thought you hated the ocean.
Well, I-I spent a lot of time and money working through that,
amongst other things.
So...
I'm buying a boat.
Right.
Just not this one.
Amanda must be some special girl.
Can I help you with something?
You don't like me much,
do you?
One more thing for you to work through, I guess.
The response to your "In with the new" Memorial day party
has been overwhelming, Mrs. Grayson.
The party is at 90% capacity...
and the "Regrets" Web site's
already collected nearly $50,000,
for everything from domestic violence prevention
to cancer awareness.
Some of these regrets wouldn't wipe their noses
with $50,000, dear.
If we're going to set a more generous tone for the summer,
it's clear I'm going to have to do something fresh and provocative,
so...
I've decided to auction off a piece
from my personal art collection.
What a wild idea, Victoria.
Well, I don't care how good the cause is,
if you put up the Van Gogh that Michael and I gave you...
I'll kill myself.
The Van Gogh is off limits for sentimental reasons.
Ashley, would you please add the new announcement
to the web site, see if we can't drum up some more business?
And, ladies, thanks again.
Lydia...
We were all so sorry to hear
about you and Michael this winter.
You were one of those couples everyone roots for.
I have no doubt.
How are you holding up?
Michael's threatening to put the beach house on the market
if I don't release my claim on the west side walk-up.
It's bad enough, having some stranger renting it out.
I can't bear the thought of losing it to one of the she-wolves.
Mm. Well, then don't let them see your weakness.
It's the first thing they'll use against you.
All right?
Thank you.
Hey, you want to know a trick?
Yeah.
You plant your feet in the sand
and you stand still through the whole first wave.
Okay.
Then the next wave's gonna feel warmer.
And then the one after that's gonna feel warmer still.
Finally, you're barely gonna notice the cold at all.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Here it comes.
You must come from a family of polar bears.
That water is ice cold.
Only at first.
After a while, you can't feel anything.
Sounds like my marriage.
You must be the new renter.
Emily Thorne.
Word gets around fast.
Like lightning.
I'm lydia Davis.
My husband and I own the house you're staying in.
It's so nice to meet you.
I can't tell you how much I love it.
Me, too.
Some good memories were made there.
Well, hopefully I can make some of my own.
So long as we don't have to take it out of your damage deposit.
Welcome to the Hamptons.
Federal prosecutors wrapped up their case for treason
against disgraced hedge fund executive David Clarke.
Taking the stand was Clarke's secretary,
Lydia Davis,
whose testimony supported
the damning allegations made by Clarke's former boss,
Conrad Grayson.
Grayson's testimony detailed the scheme
Clarke used to channel money to the terrorists
responsible for the downing of flight 1-9-7.
All 246 Americans onboard that flight were killed.
What do you like better, dad,
sea glass or starfish?
Dad?
Starfish, definitely.
Here you go.
Thank you.
David, it's Victoria.
Hey, do you mind going and looking after Sammy for me?
Sure.
David, are you there?
What's the matter, Sammy?
Hey, everything okay?
Whatcha doin'?
Daddy!
Whoa, whoa. What's going on?
Hands up so I can see 'em. What's going on?
You're making a mis--wait! You're making a mistake!
Get your hands off my daughter! Aah! No!
Amanda! Let her go!
Amanda! Amanda!
David Clarke had everyone fooled,
including me.
I'm just glad I can help put that monster away.
No one is to approach the head table
unless they're escorted by either myself or Mrs. Grayson.
I cannot stress how important that seating chart is.
Got it?
I got it.
Good.
At 2 o'clock, security will be
delivering Mrs. Grayson's Manet
to be set up for auction in the main cabin.
Okay?
Ems, please don't kill me.
Well, that depends.
What am I not killing you for?
Standing you up this afternoon.
I have a million-dollar art auction to deal with.
Oh, there's no pressure there.
You want me to pick up your dress for you?
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
Oh, please. I'm sightseeing your working.
I got you covered.
Thank you.
Bye.
More tea?
Please.
Do you think I'm tan enough for my first day on the beach
or do I need another spray?
What you need is another bathing suit.
Compared to what the rest of my friends are wearing,
This is practically a burka,
unlike the rest of your friends...
It's important to me that you don't end up
on "Page six" at one of Diddy's hot tub parties.
Danny's home.
Ooh, Danny!
How you doing?
I'm so happy to see you.
I'm so glad to see you. What's going on, a fire sale?
Charity stunt.
Welcome home, Daniel.
Hi, mom.
I'm headed down to the beach.
Okay.
Okay.
she's growing up fast.
Too fast.
You hungry?
You know, I'm a little wiped out.
I think I'll just lay down for a bit.
Yeah, you look a little tired.
Well, studying will do that to a guy.
Mm. So will partying.
Mom, I just got here.
Give me a break.
Where's dad, golfing?
Where else?
Yep. Where else?
Now...
It feels like summer.
Champagne?
You have to ask?
Conrad?
What's wrong?
Are you okay?
Conrad.
oh, god.
All right, so the first thing you do is enter the code.
It's not exactly...
Ooh. Then you swipe the card.
Then the amount.
Are we eating in here?
Uh, yeah. I'm afraid so.
Dec.
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
Uh, card, swipe, amount, right?
Code, swipe, amount.
Jack, will you take care of the mean girls' table?
It's too early in the season for me to start making enemies.
Why should this year be any different?
Because you're sailing off to save the world,
and this place can't afford bad press.
Yeah, yeah, I, uh,
I got it. Okay?
Hi. Can I help you?
Um, are you the owner?
Hopefully not for another 30 years or so.
You're looking for my dad.
Some suit's looking for you.
You are?
Um, Doug Reid with first federal.
Oh, Mr. Reid.
I'll take care of him, Jack.
Hey, Mr. Reid.
Carl Porter.
Nice to meet you. Thanks for coming down.
Why don't you follow me to my office?
I know you like him. Here he comes.
Ladies.
We'll take three rum and diets.
Uh, gonna need to see IDs.
Um, we left our IDs at the beach,
but we have plenty of money.
Sorry. I'm not interested in your money.
Are you interested in my phone number?
It looks like a stemi.
We need to get him in quick.
What does that mean?
Is he gonna be okay?
Ma'am, I need you to step back, please.
Where are you taking him?
Southfork Hospital.
Lydia. Lydia.
One, two...
Emily Thorne.
My--my god. Is this your husband?
Do you need a ride to the hospital?
No, I don't. I--
...And an E.K.G. as soon as we get there.
Sammy.
The whole point of fetch is to bring the stick back
when I throw it. I really gotta explain this again?
Come here.
come here, Sammy.
I found a stick for you.
What's his name?
Sam.
He sure likes sticks.
Fetch it, Sammy.
Nice throw.
Thanks.
I'm Jack.
I'm Amanda.
Come on, Sammy. Pick up the stick.
Where you going?
Get back here.
What are you doing?
Sammy.
Sam?
Barks. Sammy!
Sammy! Get down.
What's the matter with you? I'm sorry.
He's not normally this friendly.
He's kind of an old grump, actually.
Oh, he got mud on your dress.
Oh, that's no big deal.
There's an Earl and Emma's dry cleaners
right around the cornor.
I'll walk you over.
Oh, that's okay. Um, I got it.
Thanks.
Well, hey.
Uh, tell Earl and Emma
that you're a friend of Jack Porter's.
My family owns the tavern down by the docks, the Stowaway.
What's--what's your name?
I'll... put you on the official comp list.
You don't have to do that.
Well, I'm not picking up the tab. Sammy is.
He feels terrible. Don't you?
Thanks anyway.
All righty, then.
You have a great summer.
Hey. Oh, my god, Conrad.
I thought I was going to find you dead.
I'm fine.
What happened?
Acute abdominal dyspepsia.
The remorse of a guilty stomach.
Your staff made it sound as if he was having a heart attack.
Well, depending on the severity,
the symptoms can be identical.
As far as I can tell,
your husband's as healthy as a thoroughbred.
But I do suggest that he stay away
from the Southfork Inn's spicy bisque for a while.
The Southfork Inn?
Yeah.
I thought you went golfing.
Yeah, I did, earlier.
Southfork is a half-hour in the opposite direction.
I'm aware of that.
Excuse me.
Come on. You know I just get in the way
when you're planning one of your parties.
I just thought I would go for a drive
and stay out of your hair for a while.
And I'm sorry that I scared you.
Don't do it again.
Emily.
You look amazing.
I look amazing? Look at you. Look at this party.
Congratulations.
Well, it's too early for that. Haven't you seen "Titanic"?
So how well do you know these people?
Well enough to know who to keep away from
and who to snuck up to.
Mm. Quick tutorial?
Okay.
The girl in the orange Escada dress?
That's Mayor Bloomberg's niece.
And the woman she's talking to,
now this one is important--
Megan Foster.
shoe buyer for Barneys of New York.
Gray suit boy is kinda cute.
That's Daniel Grayson,
Victoria's tragically privileged spawn.
Daniel wrapped his convertible around a tree last summer
after one too many.
Didn't hurt his face much.
Yeah, it didn't work out quite as well
for the waitress he was shagging.
His parents paid off everyone and their mother
to keep him out of jail.
And the plot thickens.
Who's that?
Nolan Ross.
Former tech boom whiz kid
and perennial pain in the ass.
If you emptied the bank accounts of everyone at this party,
it wouldn't add up to the interest he makes in a week.
And that...
is Queen Victoria.
Wow. Hello, Nolan.
Hello, Victoria. How are you?
I think she spotted you.
Good.
Introduce us.
Hey, how about that stock split, huh?
What'd I tell you? Turned out great.
Conrad.
Yeah.
We weren't sure we were going to see you this afternoon.
Huh? Rumor had it that you, uh, really dodged a bullet yesterday.
Oh, well, I'm happy to report that the rumors of my demise
are greatly exaggerated.
Oh. Well, I'm thrilled to hear it.
I'll be sure to spread the word.
Oh, I'm sure you will.
Lydia.
I just...
Karrie, you look like you could use another drink.
Darling, would you please show her the way to the bar?
Sure.
Lydia.
Where have you been hiding yourself?
I left three messages for you.
Mrs. Grayson, forgive me for interrupting.
I just wanted to introduce you to a dear friend of mine.
Victoria Grayson, Emily thorne.
Hello, Mrs. Grayson.
Ah, Ms. Thorne.
I was wondering who the late entry was
on the guest roster.
Well, Emily's new to the Hamptons,
but she really wanted to take part in your fund-raiser.
Oh. How do you two know each other?
We volunteered together at the met this winter.
Mm. Apparently being a sustaining patron
just wasn't enough for Emily.
Mm. I try to give back as much as I can.
Lydia. Hi.
Oh, don't tell me
You've taken up volunteering at the MET as well.
Emily's renting my house for the summer.
We met briefly on the beach.
And then yesterday at the Southfork Inn.
I hope your husband's feeling better.
Victoria, wait.
Everyone, listen up, please.
I just want to thank you all for helping the Stowaway
kick off the season right.
Where were you people all winter?
Tomorrow my son Jack is setting sail for Haiti
to pitch in with the red cross.
Good luck, Jack!
He wanted to go right after the quake,
but I convinced him to stick around an extra year
to help me out.
Almost two, actually, but who's counting?
Was it two?
Yeah.
It was two.
Good going, Jack.
To Jack!
To Jack!
I'm gonna miss you, son.
I'm gonna miss you, too.
Mr. Porter, do you have a moment?
Sure. Right this way.
The bank is not going to approve any further extensions.
But business is back. All's I need is 30 more days.
I am sorry. It's out of my hands.
Here we go round again, Danny boy,
Summertime in the Hamptons.
Yep.
Same people, same parties...
Same everything.
Where do you want to discuss it?
Yo, man.
Want to bump it up a notch?
Oh, my god! Wow.
I'm so sorry. God, I'm such an idiot.
No, don't worry about it.
It's, uh, probably the universe
telling me I need a costume change.
Uh... I'm Daniel.
Emily.
How about I get you a dry Martini?
Twice the alcohol, half the stain potential.
Sure. I'm sorry.
No, no. It's okay. Now wait right here.
How much does he owe?
I'm sorry. That's between your dad and the bank.
Come on. He's owned the place 30 years.
How bad is it?
The bank's gonna foreclose at the end of the month.
The only way to stop it now is full payment on arrears.
I am sorry. There's nothing I can do.
Good afternoon, everyone,
and happy Memorial Day.
I wanted the theme of today's party
to signify a fresh start for all of us.
As difficult as the last few years have been,
they have been devastating on our charities.
But now, as things are beginning to turn around,
I'm looking forward to giving back,
and I know that all of you are, too.
So to start things off right,
I'd like to announce the winner of the art auction,
My dear friend...
Lydia Davis...
who won't be going home with the Manet this evening,
but with the treasured Van Gogh that hangs in my living room.
But I thought the Van Gogh was a gift from Lydia and Michael.
Have Ms. Davis escorted off the boat.
And in related news,
Lydia has asked me
to announce that the beach house she shared with her husband
is officially on the market.
I'm afraid this will be
her final weekend in the Hamptons.
So call your realtors, ladies and gentlemen,
because this one's going to go fast.
And, Lydia...
wherever you end up,
I hope that the Van Gogh is a constant reminder
of the friendship we shared.
Get your hands off my daughter!
I want that kid outta here. Now!
Give her to social services! Daddy!
Amanda!
Where are you taking her?!
No! Daddy!
Amanda! No!
She's really something, isn't she?
My mother.
She sure is.
To chance meetings.
To an unforgettable summer.
How many Harvard men does it take
to screw in a lightbulb?
I don't know. How many?
One, and the whole world just revolves around him.
One more?
Drink or joke?
Either. Both.
Mm. Neither.
I am just buzzed enough to find that last joke funny.
One more, and I might think that you meant it.
But don't let me stop you.
Oh, no, no. I've had about all the club soda I can take.
You don't drink?
Used to...
epically.
I gotta admit, it's--
it's nice meeting someone who never knew the old me.
Yeah.
I know the feeling.
Double infinity.
Something like that.
That's a long time.
Daniel...
your father and I are leaving.
Thank you for a lovely party, Mrs. Grayson.
It was great meeting both of you.
Well, now that you've moved in next door,
I suppose we'll be seeing a lot of you this summer.
I'll expect you shortly, Daniel.
Don't let my mom rattle you.
Intimidation is practically a sign of endearment with her.
I'd hate to be on her bad side.
Yes, you would.
I should go.
Uh, I'm headed your way. You need a ride?
No, thanks.
Maybe next time.
Till next time.
you didn't have to exile her.
What you did was cruel.
Oh, what I did was cruel?
You could have had anyone,
and you knew she was my closest friend.
It was never meant to be an affair.
Oh, it just happened?
Are you physically incapable of
taking responsibility for your actions?
There is a problem we seem to share.
If you'll remember, I gave up everything once
to prove how much I love you.
I returned the favor. I helped you destroy a man.
Oh, no, no, no. That was your idea, not mine.
You did what you did to save yourself as much as me.
A compromise I'm reminded of every day.
You got plenty in the bargain.
These guys really put the "suck" in seersucker.
What a waste of humanity.
With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?
Hey. It's, uh...
It's Jack Porter.
Listen, if you still want to buy my boat,
bring a check down to the docks first thing in the morning.
Okay?
There's nothing I'd like to do more.
All right. See you then.
Welcome home, Amanda.
I nearly didn't recognize you today,
But that's the whole point, isn't it?
Do you know how easy it would be for me to crush your windpipe?
I don't think your father would approve.
Amanda...
Oh... Your father trusted me.
My father trusted everybody.
What are you doing here, Nolan?
Don't worry. Don't worry. Your secret's safe.
No one wants this imperious cadre
of toxic phonies to eat it more than yours truly.
So how can I be of service?
You can't.
You're not a part of this.
Yes, I am.
Remember, I witnessed firsthand
What these people did to your father.
They're hard-core.
I can handle them.
And I have no problem taking you down, too,
If you get in my way.
I-I don't want to get in your way.
I want to help you.
You can't help me, Nolan.
Suit yourself.
But I can be just as powerful an enemy
as any one of them.
Just sayin'.
You might be interested to know,
I had a nice chat with Jack Porter tonight.
Guess who's still carrying a torch
for little Amanda Clarke.
Amanda Clarke no longer exists.
Clarke, happy birthday.
You've been emancipated.
Amanda Clarke.
Who are you?
Nolan Ross. Friend of your father's.
You're not exactly the little angel he described.
My father hasn't seen me in ten years.
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.
He passed away.
Six weeks ago.
He wanted you to have something.
Whatever that is, I don't want it.
Oh, no, no, no, trust me. You definitely do.
My father was a murderer and a liar.
So why would I trust you, huh?
'cause that's just what they want you to believe.
Forget everything that you think you know, amanda.
Your dad was protecting you.
From what?
Open the box.
Find out.
Your father was the first person to believe in me.
He invested in my company when no one else would.
That key, it opens a lock box in zurich.
Now that you're 18,
You're officially
49% owner of my company.
Board meetings are every other Wednesday, but...
You don't have to show up.
I never do.
"My dear Amanda...
If you're reading this,
then two things have come to pass.
I am finally able to provide you the life
you were unjustly denied.
And sadly, I won't be able
to share that life with you.
I hope these journals provide answers
to the questions you've had all these years.
I am not the man they say I am.
And I did not do the things they say I did.
All I ask is that you promise to do the one thing.
That's been so hard for me to do.
Forgive."
But that was a promise
I couldn't keep.
When deception cuts this deep,
someone has to pay.
My father's chance
to bring justice to the truly guilty was stolen from him.
His only option was to forgive.
I have others.
Would you set it up by the windows, please?
And I'd like some, uh, pepper in my bisque.
They say vengeance is a dish best served cold.
But sometimes it's as warm as a bowl of soup.
My father died an innocent man,
betrayed by the woman he loved.
When everything you love has been stolen from you,
sometimes all you have left is revenge.
Like I said...
This is not a story about forgiveness.
Yes?
I want you to find out everything you can
about a young woman named Emily Thorne.
Emily Thorne?
