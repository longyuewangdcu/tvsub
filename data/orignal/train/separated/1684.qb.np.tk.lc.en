okay , help me out here .
how does an archeology professor get that good with a whip ?
maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore .
that &apos;s how i learned .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;ve never seen &lt; i &gt; raiders of the lost ark . &lt; / i &gt;
and i can &apos;t believe you &apos;ve never read &lt; i &gt; eat , pray , love . &lt; / i &gt;
when she comes out with
&lt; i &gt; eat , pray , run away from a &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; giant boulder , &lt; / i &gt; i &apos;ll read it .
i don &apos;t care if &lt; i &gt; eat , pray , love &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; changed your life , &lt; / i &gt;
i &apos;m not reading it .
you know , i could totally rock a hat like that .
that &apos;s the work of noted hollywood costume designer
deborah nadoolman .
she also designed
the iconic red and black jacket
in michael jackson &apos;s &lt; i &gt; thriller &lt; / i &gt; video ,
which i &apos;ve never viewed in its entirety ,
as i find zombies dancing
in choreographed synchronicity implausible .
and also , it &apos;s really scary .
would someone please turn off the sheldon commentary track ?
there &apos;s no switch . just listen and learn .
penny , if you think this is good ,
you should come with us friday
to see it on the big screen at the colonial .
well , i &apos;m watching it now .
why would i want to see it again on friday ?
because the print they &apos;re showing on friday
has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage .
what ? 21 seconds ? that &apos;ll be like seeing a whole new movie !
exactly .
they say it finally solves the submarine controversy .
did-- leonard ?
i &apos;m no expert , but i believe
what we just heard from penny was sarcasm .
oh ! good .
i &apos;m 8 for 26 this month .
yeah , i think i &apos;ll pass .
but you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds .
bet if i could make you understand
why this is such a cool thing , we &apos;d still be together .
mm , yeah , no , we wouldn &apos;t .
uh @-@ huh .
i &apos;m guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that , too .
may i point out to you all
that the screening is &quot; first come , first served &quot; ?
relax , it &apos;s 5 : 00 . the movie doesn &apos;t start till midnight .
another way of saying that is
&quot; the movie starts at midnight , and it &apos;s already 5 : 00 . &quot;
let &apos;s go .
you know , if we miss it , we &apos;ll have the fun of
listening to sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives .
see ? howard &apos;s on my side .
actually , i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m using sarcasm to mock you .
drat . now i &apos;m 8 for 27 .
don &apos;t worry , sheldon.we &apos;ll be fine .
what happened to the leonard hofstadter
who waited in line with me for 14 hours
to see the midnight premiere of &lt; i &gt; star trek : nemesis ? &lt; / i &gt;
oh . well , he waited in line for 14 hours ,
while you napped in a lawn chair ,
he got in a fight with a klingon
when he stepped out of line to pee
and you wouldn &apos;t wake up to vouch for him ,
and worst of all , he saw &lt; i &gt; star trek : nemesis . &lt; / i &gt;
but how were our seats ?
excellent .
i rest my case .
amy , don &apos;t you agree we should leave now and get in line ?
actually , as the newest member of your social group ,
i believe i &apos;ll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily
siding with your friends from time to time .
shrewd .
leonard , you &apos;re right .
we should enjoy our meal , arrive late ,
and risk winding up with terrible seats ,
assuming we get in at all .
thank you , amy .
see ? it &apos;s working .
knock @-@ knock .
who &apos;s there ?
olive . &#91; i love u &#93;
olive you , too .
guys , that &apos;s really starting to get old .
knock @-@ knock .
who &apos;s there ?
i have a girlfriend and you don &apos;t .
hysterical !
wait , now , we don &apos;t know that yet . he isn &apos;t finished .
i have a girlfriend and you don &apos;t &lt; i &gt; who ? &lt; / i &gt;
so . are you sure you don &apos;t want to come with us to &lt; i &gt; raiders ? &lt; / i &gt;
oh , no . that movie has melting faces .
it reminds me too much of the time
i dropped that vial of flesh @-@ eating bacteria
into the rhesus monkey lab .
besides , penny and i are having a girls &apos; night tonight .
girls &apos; night ? what does that entail ?
oh , you know , girls get together ,
hang out , share girl talk .
i &apos;m a girl .
oh . well , maybe you can join us . i &apos;ll ask penny .
no need . penny and i are very close .
you are ?
yes . in fact , our menses are synchronized .
penny .
bernadette tells me you &apos;re planning a girls &apos; night .
i &apos;m a girl .
oh . um , it was -- it was just going to be me and bernadette .
besides , i thought you were going to the movies
with sheldon and the guys .
yes , but they &apos;re not girls .
i &apos;m a girl .
yeah , no , no , i @-@ i @-@ i got that .
what &apos;s the dress code ?
uh , just wear something comfortable .
all right . i &apos;ll have to go shopping .
knock @-@ knock .
who is there ?
hugh .
hugh who ?
hugh people need to listen to me .
it &apos;s time to get in line for the movie .
and that &apos;s how you tell a knock @-@ knock joke .
under normal circumstances i &apos;d say , &quot; i told you so . &quot;
but as i have told you so
with such vehemence and frequency already ,
the phrase has lost all meaning .
therefore , i will be replacing it with the phrase :
&quot; i informed you thusly . &quot;
ooh . can &apos;t wait for that to start .
i informed you thusly .
8 for 28 .
this is where we could have been
if we hadn &apos;t stopped for dinner .
this is where we could have been
if koothrappali hadn &apos;t ordered dessert .
well i earned it , dude , i ate all my broccoli .
and here &apos;s where we are . the runts in a large litter .
unlikely to ever reach
the nourishing teats of indiana jones .
so i guess it &apos;s a good thing we stopped for dinner .
you know , guys , when facing disappointment ,
&lt; i &gt; eat , pray , love &lt; / i &gt; teaches us --
oh , shut up .
... so anyway , to make a long story short ,
turns out i have an unusually firm cervix .
you know -- amy , when we say &quot; girl talk , &quot;
it doesn &apos;t just have to be about our lady parts .
shame . &apos; cause i have a real zinger
about my tilted uterus .
penny , your nails look great .
oh , thanks . i found this place in alhambra .
it &apos;s in a woman &apos;s basement .
i think it &apos;s a front for human trafficking ,
but they do a really good job .
a colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus
that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements .
well don &apos;t tell me that &apos;s not &quot; girl talk . &quot;
so where should we go tonight ?
a bar ? a club ? a movie ?
or we could just stay here .
yes , a continue to bond .
i have a feeling that after tonight ,
one of you will become my best friend forever .
or &quot; bff , &quot; if you prefer .
which i don &apos;t .
all right , time to open bachelor number two .
gee , i don &apos;t know if i should drink more .
i have to drive home , and i &apos;ve got enough trouble
seeing over the dashboard as it is .
that &apos;s okay . you can just sleep here .
oh , good , a slumber party !
we &apos;ll do makeovers , initiate phony phone calls ,
and have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties !
oh , gosh , amy .
i don &apos;t know if i would call this an actual slumber party .
well , that &apos;s disappointing .
i &apos;ve always wanted to be invited to a slumber party .
oh , you never were ?
not even when you were a kid ?
well , there was the time i had my tonsils out ,
and i shared a room with a little vietnamese girl .
she didn &apos;t make it through the night ,
but up till then , it was kind of fun .
okay . well , i guess we &apos;re having a slumber party .
pillow fight !
oh , i hope they let us in soon .
i &apos;m tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom .
the guy makes me buy a gatorade every time .
it &apos;s a vicious circle .
too bad you don &apos;t have a stadium pal like me .
what &apos;s a stadium pal ?
let me put it this way :
takes care of the bathroom problem ,
and it keeps your calf warm .
hey , guys , bad news . i just did a quick calculation .
given the size of the theater and the length of this line ,
we might not get seats .
what did he say ?
nice going , raj .
just got him down for his nap .
we might not get seats ? !
it &apos;s fine , it &apos;s fine.go back to sleep .
oh , i informed you thusly ! i so informed you thusly .
howard , you talk to him .
howard ?
you &apos;re peeing , aren &apos;t you ?
hey , look who &apos;s here !
hey , buddies !
well , if it isn &apos;t wil wheaton ,
the jar jar binks of the &lt; i &gt; star trek &lt; / i &gt; universe .
( la ja ja binks ) mee @-@ sa think that very funny !
well , you @-@ sa can go think that at the back of the line .
no cuts , no buts , no coconuts .
wil wheaton .
yeah .
i &apos;m a big fan .
of what ? poorly executed beards ?
do you think you could get me and my friends into the movie ?
we got here a little late .
no problem . come on , i &apos;ll hook you up .
awesome .
we @-@ sa gonna go into the movie now ! bye @-@ bye !
this is &lt; i &gt; indiana &lt; / i &gt; jones ,
not &lt; i &gt; star trek . &lt; / i &gt;
there should be no value to his pseudo @-@ celebrity here !
and even at star trek conventions ,
they only let him in if he helps set up !
calm down , sheldon .
i will not calm down .
this affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered .
as captain jean @-@ luc picard once said ,
&quot; the line must be drawn here !
&quot; this far , no farther ! &quot;
had to wake him up from his nap , didn &apos;t you ?
you know what i really love about howard ?
his chest hair .
howard has a hairy chest ?
no , just the one .
but it &apos;s really long .
okay , there you go-- sultry sunrise red .
what do you think ?
my nails have never looked so pretty before .
get it off .
oh , oh , uh , looks like they &apos;re getting ready
to let people in .
listen to what mr. wil wheaton is tweeting .
&quot; best seats in house for &lt; i &gt; raiders &lt; / i &gt; screening .
suck on that , sheldon cooper . &quot;
why do you read his twitter feed ?
you know it &apos;s only going to upset you .
i believe in knowing my enemy , leonard .
had twitter existed at the time , would not general custer
have followed the tweets of sitting bull ?
would not lee have followed grant ?
would not spy have followed spy ?
i have more examples , but excuse me .
hello .
well , this seems like an odd time
to test my cell phone quality , but go on .
test phrases ? all right .
im a tote .
ulba .
twad .
all together ?
i &apos;m a total buttwad .
why are you laughing ?
hello ?
and that , girls , is how you make a phony phone call .
i &apos;m not sure i grasp
the full entertainment value , but all right .
next on wikipedia &apos;s list of slumber party activities :
&quot; truth or dare . &quot;
okay , it &apos;s your game . you go first .
hang on . i &apos;m familiarizing myself with the rules .
seems fairly straightforward .
bernadette , truth or dare ?
truth .
all right .
to what temperature must you heat beef
in order to kill the prion
that cses bovinespongiform encephalopathy ?
um ...
remember , you have to answer honestly .
wait . no , amy , you &apos;re supposed to ask her
something personal or embarrassing .
oh . all right .
what is the circumference of your areolas ?
&quot; munching on complimentary popcorn .
woot , woot . &quot;
oh , the gall .
i hope his next tweet is &quot; popcorn lodged in trachea .
choking to death .
woot , woot . &quot;
guys , i am sorry.we are full up .
no !
we &apos;re full up .
we really want to see this .
isn &apos;t there anythingyou can do ?
sorry . fire regulations .
should &apos;ve gotten here earlier .
this is nothing but ablatant abuse of power
by a petty functionary .
explain to me why wil wheaton and his lackeys
get in and we don &apos;t .
&apos;cause i &apos;m the petty functionary with a clipboard , bitch .
i guess that &apos;s that .
let &apos;s go home .
you know what ? i &apos;m going back to &quot; i told you so . &quot;
i told you so .
we can still see something .
oh , the new sandra bullock movie is playing two blocks away .
you know sandy b. always brings it .
look-- a side door .
come on , short round .
i guess we &apos;d bettergo after him .
short round ?
indy &apos;s young sidekick from &lt; i &gt; temple of doom . &lt; / i &gt;
yeah , i know who itis , but why is it me ?
you &apos;re right . it shouldbe a cuddly asian boy .
like me .
&quot; and absalom has kissed her nether eye ,
&quot; and nicholas is branded on the butt .
this tale is done , and god save all the rout . &quot;
what the hell was that ?
bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story .
&quot; the miller &apos;s tale &quot; by chaucer is the dirtiest story i know .
it would have been hidden in sock drawers
if people in the 14th century had worn socks .
i thought it was pretty spicy .
especially the part where he kisses her nether eye .
you might not like it as much
if you knew what &quot; nether eye &quot; meant .
hint : if one cares about hygiene ,
one ought not be kissing it .
okay , my turn .
penny , truth or dare ?
truth .
why are you still hanging out with leonard so much
even though you broke up with him ?
oh , that &apos;s an excellent question .
for two people who claim to be no longer pair @-@ bonded ,
you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other &apos;s company .
yeah .
dare .
i don &apos;t believe the rules allow
for an ex post facto option change .
yeah .
okay , look , just because we &apos;re not seeing each other anymore
doesn &apos;t meanwe can &apos;t be friends .
i mean , leonard &apos;s a great guy .
then , why did you terminate your relationship with him ?
i don &apos;t know .
he got really serious , and i wasn &apos;t ready for it .
interesting .
how will you react if , in the future ,
you become ready for it , and leonard is unavailable ,
because another woman has realized that he is--
to use your words-- &quot; a great guy &quot; ?
you can only ask one question .
that one .
you know what , i don &apos;t want to play anymore .
well , i &apos;m not sure how this is scored ,
but i believe we may have won .
sheldon ?
sheldon ?
where did he go ?
we &apos;re looking for sheldon , not marmaduke .
you whistled ?
what is that ?
&lt; i &gt; raiders of the lost ark &lt; / i &gt;
with 21 additional seconds .
if i can &apos;t see it , no one else can see it .
sheldon , this is crazy .
no . crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended .
listen to me .
you are over @-@ tired . you &apos;re not thinking right .
put the movie back before we get into trouble .
trouble is my middle name , leonard .
actually , it &apos;s lee , but i prefer trouble .
oh , look who they let in .
don &apos;t worry , wil wheaton . i was just leaving .
come on , short round .
yeah .
come on , guys ! hurry up ! hurry up !
let &apos;s see you run with a bag of urines trapped to your leg .
科洛尼奥电影院是每年纪念 《 斑点 》 拍摄的地方
he &apos;s got the movie ! get him !
why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one ?
she &apos;s been in there a long time .
clearly , losing truth or dare upset her .
perhaps we should try to take her mind off it
with anothor popular slumber party activity .
ooh , like what ?
well , the internet suggests
that slumber party guests often engage
in harmless experimentation with lesbianism .
where exactly on the internet have you been looking ?
penny ?
oh , hey , amy .
look , i &apos;m sorry i got so upset . i just ...
what are you doing ?
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll avoid the nether eye .
