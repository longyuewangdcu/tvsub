Turn around.
Slowly.
Get up.
What are you doing with that?
I'll get HPD down here, process the place.
No.
Don't bother.
They're not going to find anything.
The guys wore gloves.
What are you eating?
Nothing. Ice, for your head.
I'm fine.
Don't be a tough guy, okay?
I've been popped with a stun gun before.
It's no fun. Ice helps.
You've been stun gunned?
Yes, I've been stunned. Hoboken, Halloween '02.
It's a long story I don't want to tell you right now.
How many guys were there?
Three.
Three. Okay, good, 'cause I was wondering how
one little burglar comes in and takes advantage
of a Navy SEAL.
They weren't burglars, okay?
They were professionals, they were organized and precise.
Yeah, the stun guns, gloves, they knew exactly
what they were after. There's no doubt you were targeted.
Yeah, targeted I understand.
But how'd they get you? Did you not put
an alarm system in here after the General Pak thing?
I told you to do that. I don't want to be a nag,
but I did say you should do that.
I put it in, okay?
They made a clean entry.
They didn't trip the sensors, I don't understand.
Nothing was tripped because they hacked your system
using the alarm company's servers.
They disarmed it as if you did it yourself.
Did you find out where they came in?
Yeah. There are boot prints leading up to
and away from the back door,
but there are no signs of forced entry.
All the windows are secure, too.
If they broke in, I can't tell where.
They take anything other than your father's tool box?
No.
But my father's entire investigation
into my mother's murder was in that box.
All right, I'm not a rocket scientist, but that is
the reason the jackers were in here, they wanted that evidence.
How did they know about the evidence?
I didn't mention it to anyone.
When I called HPD archives to get the accident report,
I just asked for a file number.
Did you guys mention the Champ box
to anybody at all? Anybody?
No.
No.
And you never talked about it with anyone else?
I talked to the people in this room.
And my sister.
I talked to my sister.
Hi, it's Mary. Leave me a message.
Something's wrong.
Do me a favor, please. Will you not go there?
Okay? You don't know anything. Maybe she went out last night.
Maybe she got a little goofy, she's sleeping it off.
And let me be honest about something,
If, first thing in the morning, I see your face pop on my phone,
I might not answer it either.
They didn't break into the house, Danny.
And the only other person
who has a key to the house is Mary.
Mary, you in there?
Mary, it's Steve.
Mary.
Whole house is clear.
Maybe Mary was never here. Huh?
Maybe they just ransacked the place.
She was here.
I got blood.
What the hell is that?
It's a tooth.
Mary's.
I hope not.
Whoever took the box took Mary.
Any word from HPD?
Nothing yet. There's an APB out on Mary,
and Kono's canvassing the neighbors
just in case anyone heard or saw anything.
All right. This from the crime lab?
Yeah. I had them rush the blood and tooth analysis.
Now, these results are just preliminary,
but the good news is
they look like they came from the same person: male.
Okay.
No hits in the system, though.
What about her cell phone? We didn't find it at the scene.
Yeah, I pulled her records
looking for any anomalies in the call history.
There's only one that looked out of place.
That was to a surf rental stand in Waikiki.
Owner's name is Mamo Kahike.
She called Mamo?
You know this guy?
Yeah, I did.
Mamo lived in our old neighborhood
when Mary and I were just kids.
He's the one who taught us how to surf.
Guy's been a beach boy since the days of Duke Kahanamoku.
Beach Boy, huh?
You know, I've heard of, um, Mike Love, Brian Wilson,
but I've never heard of Mamo the Beach Boy.
Yeah, different beach boys, Danny.
They were locals who set up shop in Waikiki
to teach people how to surf.
All right. Why would Mary go and see this guy
before she gets kidnapped?
I don't know, but I'm guessing it's not for surf lessons.
There he is.
Mamo!
Stevie!
Howzit, bruddah.
You look great.
You haven't changed in 18 years.
Eh, da hair gone white and no more get nothing in the biceps.
Come on. You look great. This is Detective Danny Williams.
Detective?
How you doing?
What bring you here?
My sister.
Did she come see you, Mamo?
Yeah, she come around couple days ago.
Ask me questions about your mother.
What did you tell her?
The truth.
The truth being
that my mother didn't die in a car accident,
that it was a car bomb that killed her?
Yes.
How did you know, Mamo?
Before your mom died in that car,
I saw a cop hanging around it,
looking under it.
I know it was a long time ago.
You get a good look at him?
Asian. Maybe six feet?
I tell your father. He told me not to report it.
Not to trust any other cop.
I would have kept my promise to your father,
but when Mary come to me,
I felt an obligation to her...
...and now to you.
All this time,
why you come to me now?
Because I think the questions that Mary's been asking
about our mother have just got her kidnapped.
Oh, no. No.
I should've seen this coming.
You should have seen what coming, a kidnapping?
No. Mary digging around the box.
I mean, she's my sister. I know what she's like.
The minute she found out
that Dad was looking into our mother's murder,
she would never have let that go.
And now it's my fault she's missing.
I don't know where she is.
For all I know...
You don't know anything.
All right? Your sister Mary is a very smart girl.
Can we just think positive a little bit? Can we do that?
Danny, they took her. She saw their faces.
They took her because she is valuable to them.
You understand that? She is valuable.
She knows what's inside that box.
They want to know what she knows.
All right, this is a good thing.
This keeps her alive, you understand?
All right. We're gonna find her.
We're gonna find her. And after that,
we're gonna find that cop that Mamo saw.
I need a list of all the officers
on the force at the time of my mom's murder.
Do you not think that your father
didn't already investigate these guys?
Yeah, I'm sure he did, but don't you think
there's a reason he didn't make an arrest?
Absolutely. Evidence. He didn't have any.
All right? You go after a cop,
you better make sure you know what you are doing,
or you will have an entire department coming after you.
It's Mary.
Mary? Mary? Where are you?
Steve. Oh, my god, Steve.
I'm so sorry!
Calm down. Calm down. Listen to me.
Where are you, Mary?
Tell me where you are.
I'm in a trunk of a car!
We need to triangulate her signal.
Okay. Listen to me, Mary.
You got to trust me on this one. I'm going to find you,
I can promise you that,
but you go to do what I say, all right?
Chin. We got Mary up on her cell. We need a location right now.
You got to run a trace.
Okay, Mary. Listen. Can you see the taillight housing?
They should be on either side of you.
Yeah, yeah, I see them.
Kick them out, Mary. You got to kick them out.
Kick them as hard as you can.
All right. All right.
I got it, I got it out.
Look outside,
tell me what you see.
Tell me if you're passing anything familiar.
Something to help me find you.
No. I don't see anything.
We're just... It's a dirt road and we're climbing.
All right, you're climbing, OK.
What do you see, Mary?
Look out. Can you look left or right?
Can you see town? Can you see Kailua?
What part of the island are you on?
Yeah, yeah, I see the...
Mary?!
Chin, did you get a location?
I couldn't get a lock, but the last signal that came
from her cell phone bounced off a transponder near Punchbowl.
All right, Chin, listen,
it's coming from the trunk of a car
climbing upwards, all right?
That's got to be the Pali Highway.
There are dirt roads that lead to the forest reserves
right before Maunawili.
Yeah.
Pali Highway's that way.
Yeah.
Yeah, what? Why are you going this way?
Because we can't get there fast enough by car.
Be safe, bro.
All right, I've got HPD and DLNR units setting up roadblocks
on either side of the Pali,
checking trunks now.
Danny, Danny, heading up the east ridgeline.
Check out the taillight.
Yep. It's out.
Hold on.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Gun!
Mary! Mary!
Come here.
Oh, my God.
Hey, kiddo.
Thanks.
Show me that.
Hey, I'm really sorry
that I went snooping through the box, okay?
You can rub it in later.
I wasn't going to rub it in.
You know it's the only link that I had to Dad.
I just wanted to know what it all meant, you know,
between mom's accident and...
Finding out it wasn't an accident.
I understand, okay?
I mean, I was just piecing it together myself.
Why did you go to Mamo?
Because there was a postcard
from his surf shop with a bunch
of Dad's chicken scratch all over it.
I remember.
It said something like "MAGLITE,"
but there was no MAGLITE in the box.
No, but it's not a MAGLITE.
See the "G" is actually a "6."
So it's M-A-6-L-T.
It's cop shorthand.
How do you know cop shorthand?
Um, because I had this incident once in L.A.
What incident?
It doesn't matter, all right?
But the cop was writing down
all the information in the same shorthand.
So I figured that's what it was.
And since the postcard came from Mamo's,
I thought, well, maybe he's a witness.
And it turns out I was right.
So the M-A-6-L-T is a description
that he gave Dad.
M-A-6: male, Asian,
six feet tall, light complexion.
The cop that was lurking around Dad's car.
Wait a minute.
Where did you go after Mamo told you all this?
I-I didn't go anywhere.
I've been calling the HPD for months
trying to get a police report.
And they claim it's lost.
So I asked them for a list of all the officers that were there
the day of mom's death, and they shut me down again.
I mean, I was being a complete pain in the ass,
but... I was doing it for Mom, okay?
Who did you talk to at the HPD?
Everybody. Why?
Because we busted a mole in there
a while back, and if he found out
you were there asking questions,
he could have passed it on to all the wrong people.
I mean, I can't believe you did all this, Mary.
Well, I mean, Dad's a cop, you're like a freakin' ninja.
The least I could do was dial a phone.
You're something else.
Hey.
I love you.
And I'm really sorry about what happened to you today.
You know why dad shipped us away now.
It's 'cause Mom was killed.
He was trying to protect us.
How are you going to find these guys, Steve?
I don't know.
But the only other evidence that was had
about Mom's murder was in that toolbox
and now it's gone.
Wait.
Not exactly.
I can't believe you took photos of everything in the box.
I'm sorry I went behind your back.
I think I'll get over it.
I think you have a future in the family business.
Okay, wait a minute.
Why the two folders?
Well, after I went through the stuff,
I figured that anything that had to do with Mom's case,
I'd put over here.
And then that stuff-- I have no clue.
Like the postcards from Japan.
I don't know what the stick figures mean.
I think they're from
a Sherlock Holmes story-- Adventure of the Dancing Men.
Sherlock Holmes?
What are you talking about?
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
Dad used to read me those books all the time.
Okay.
He said you never had the patience.
Does that mean you know what these stick figures mean, Mary?
I don't know, bro. I mean, you're the naval intelligence guy.
I think Holmes cracked some code or something in the story.
Hey, Danny just called from the M.E.'s office.
No hits on our two kidnappers' prints,
no IDs, no DNA matches in our system.
These guys are ghosts.
Plus, they both had all their teeth.
No, but there was a third guy calling the shots,
and that's whose tooth I knocked out.
Nice work there, by the way.
Thanks.
Did Max get anything?
Check this out.
Whoa, that is some top-tier craftsmanship.
That's not any style either.
That's old school Irazumi. Yakuza.
Yeah. But judging by the work,
no full-on sleeves, these guys are low-level enforcers.
Mm-hmm, Bosozoku.
Bozo-zu... What is that?
It's a younger, flaier offshoot of the Yakuza.
They're punks.
But they're armed and dangerous punks.
All right, we know where they hang out?
Every cop in Oahu knows where they hang out.
Everyone just treats them like they're not here.
It's like they're Untouchables.
This is the place.
If our third attacker isn't in here,
they'll know where to find him.
Whoo. They got nice rides.
You know something? I've always wanted to ride one of these.
All right, up. Up, up, up, up, up.
Come on.
Get up. Face the wall.
Let's see hands.
Turn around.
That means you.
Come on.
Get in there.
Danny.
I have a number of a therapist
I want to give you, okay?
Walk up steps like a human.
Ooh. What's up with this?
Clear.
Clear.
All right. Turn around.
These friends of yours?
They friends of yours?
'Cause right now, they're dead, okay?
And I want to know who they worked for.
So the first one to talk walks.
How about you? You know these guys?
What do you got there?
Say "aah."
All right. Everybody, hit the road,
except for our friend here.
Come on, let's go.
Out, get out.
Right this way, gentlemen.
Danny?
Yes, Steven?
Theoretically, if you wanted to open this guy's mouth,
how would you do it?
Oh. Uh, well, there's the, uh, the punch in the gut.
That's good. There's the knee to the... joint.
And then I, of course have
the Williams family favorite.
What's that?
All right.
Aah. Nice and still.
Yeah. Look at that.
Missing a tooth.
Looks recent, too. Stay there.
All right.
Chin, Kono, take him in.
Get the tooth from the M.E.
Let's see if the slipper fits, Cinderella.
Excuse me? Um...
You don't want to just try asking him a question?
He was never gonna talk.
No, of course he wasn't gonna talk.
You didn't throw him into a shark tank.
Danny, these guys are Yakuza middlemen.
Okay? They don't talk, ever.
They know if they do,
their families will get wiped out.
We need to go higher up the food chain
to find out who's behind this kidnapping and my mother's murder.
Okay, but without the tooth fairy,
how are we going to do that?
This may help.
So, it took me a while to crack the phone's encryption,
but I pulled up several calls
from our kidnapper's phone to this man.
Hiro Noshimuri.
And the last one being an outgoing call
right around the time Mary said she was taken.
Oh, hold on. Steve needs to hear this. What is he doing?
Come on. We got something.
What did you find?
Prominent venture capitalist, originally from Japan.
He has residences there, Dubai, Malibu,
three here in Hawaii. He's really well-connected.
From everything I could gather, he seems
like a very well-respected, very wealthy entrepreneur.
But that does not mean he's not with the Yakuza.
Right? In Japan, the mob has been known to work
out in the open with major corporations.
What's his name?
Hiro Noshimuri.
Did I say something?
What did you say?
Hiro Noshimuri.
That's it.
That's the cipher.
Hiro Noshimuri.
The cipher. What does that mean?
In 1992, my dad was the head
of the HPD's organized crime unit.
He was investigating the expansion
of the Yakuza here in Hawaii.
And he was corresponding with somebody in Japan,
somebody who gave him the name Hiro Noshimuri, in code,
right here.
You-you got a name from a stick figure?
The stick figures are the code.
I used Frequency Analysis to crack it.
"Frequency" What?
Frequency Analysis. It's a study the frequency
of letters or groups of letters
in a cypher text.
What, are you guys dating now?
This is it. My dad was getting closer.
He wanted to uncover the identity
of the local Oyabun, the boss.
That's why they targeted him.
The Yakuza wanted him dead,
so they planted a bomb under his car,
only they didn't bet on my mother driving the car that day.
And that's why my dad wanted me to find that toolbox.
To finish this investigation that he started.
I need to know where this guy is right now.
There he is.
No, no. Guys, please.
Sit down. Relax.
We're just gonna have a nice conversation.
Go back to your, um...
spam...
salad.
Please. Have a seat.
You know, unless you're my date,
that seat's taken.
You're really gonna sit here
and pretend you don't know who I am?
Now that you mention it,
there's something quite familiar about your face.
Let me jog your memory.
See this phone?
This phone belonged to the man who kidnapped my sister.
Kidnapper? Serious.
The last person he called was you.
Wrong number.
I can assure you that I don't know anything about this.
I'm just here for my lunch date.
Let me tell you something.
I know who you are.
I know what you've done to me and to my family.
And I'm here to tell you
that no amount of money or manpower is going to save you.
Save me?
From what?
From me.
What did you say your name was?
McGarrett?
Governor Jameson.
So nice to see you again.
Nice to see you.
My date.
You know this man?
I certainly do.
We've been friends for years.
Mr. Noshimuri is a most generous benefactor of Hawaii.
Is that right?
Yes, it is.
What is it you're doing here?
Enjoy your lunch.
I just spent the last two hours
and a hefty drink tab
trying to talk down Mr. Noshimuri.
What were you thinking?
You're drinking with a criminal.
Just stop right there.
That man is responsible for over 1,200 jobs
in the Hawaii shipping industry alone.
Not to mention the other nine companies
he has established here.
Let me guess. He's a major contributor to your campaign?
Let me tell you something.
I set up this task force, I gave you immunity
and the means to pursue major felons,
not to harass major supporters of Hawaii.
If Mr. Noshimuri decides to pull up stakes
and move his considerable business ventures elsewhere,
do you have any idea what would happen to the local economy?
Well, on the brighter side, the crime rate's gonna drop.
What the hell are you talking about?
Hiro is head of the Yakuza here in Hawaii.
That is ridiculous.
18 years ago, my father was investigating a case
against the Yakuza.
He started closing in on Hiro.
Okay? So they rigged his car to explode.
Except my father was not driving his car that day.
My mother was.
Steve, that was an accident.
It was not an accident, Governor!
Damn it! Listen to me!
It was not an accident!
And my father knew it was not an accident,
but he pulled back
because of Mary and me, because we were just kids.
I knew your father. If that was true,
he would have told me.
That's just the thing.
He didn't tell anybody.
And when he died, I found this evidence that he left for me.
The evidence that led me to Hiro.
And Mary got her hands on it.
And she started making phone calls,
looking into Mom's death.
And yesterday, Hiro had her kidnapped.
What?
Oh, my God. Where is she? Is she all right?
She's fine. She's fine for now.
Oh, thank God.
I'm sorry, Steve.
Yeah.
Is there any beer in this office?
What?
I have never known a Navy man
who couldn't find a lady a beer.
Uh, yeah.
Of course.
I'll, uh... scrounge up a glass.
Thank you.
Steve...
I trust your instincts...
But?
If what you say is true,
and you're going to go after someone as powerful and as connected
as Hiro Noshimuri,
you better be damn certain you've got rock solid evidence,
and proceed with extreme caution.
Duly noted.
Because if you don't,
I don't think I'm going to be able to protect you.
Well, that, uh, looked like it went really well.
Should I pack now for Jersey, or...
You're not getting off that easy.
I want to know everything there is to know
about Hiro Noshimuri, okay?
I want to know every business he runs,
who all his employees are,
All his family members, every friend he has.
I want to know where he eats.
I want to know where he sleeps. I want it all, okay?
We're gonna tear into this guy's life,
and we're gonna rip it all apart.
I have never liked you more than in this moment right now.
It's beautiful.
Keep talking, smart-ass.
You think those zip-cuffs are tight now?
They can get a lot tighter.
Kono, I want this place strip-searched, top to bottom.
I need something-- anything-- that connects to Hiro.
Yeah, you got it.
Hey. I just got off the phone with HPD Archives.
Remember how you asked me for the names of all the cops
on the roster back in '92?
Yeah?
Well, it turns out
there was a cop who worked in your father's district
by the name of Koji Noshimuri.
Now, if that name sounds familiar,
it's because he's the brother of Hiro Noshimuri.
All right, that-that cannot be a coincidence.
He's got to be the cop that planted the bomb
on my dad's car.
Mm-hmm.
I'm going to head back to HQ,
pull everything I can on him.
Listen, we get a photo,
bring it to your boy Mamo,
maybe he can put an ID him, put him at the crime scene.
Maybe, but people look different after 18 years.
We're gonna need a photo from back then.
Yeah. No. I think I know where to get one.
My dad was a total pack rat.
Kept everything from his days as a cop.
If he's got a copy of his district picture,
it's gonna be here.
They make every officer take one.
I blinked during mine.
I look like I'm sleeping.
Grace thinks it's hysterical.
Koji Noshimuri.
That's him. That's the guy.
Let's hope your boy Mamo's got a good memory.
Chin. Tell me you got Koji.
He's alive and well, and working for his brother as-- get this--
a consultant.
He's got a place downtown, but he travels back and forth
to Japan a lot for Hiro.
Let me ask you a question. How does a consultant
working for the Yakuza earn a paycheck?
Cleaning up his brother's messes.
Hey, find out if Koji's in the country, okay?
If so, I want to know where.
Roger that.
What? What are you looking at?
What's with you?
Nothing, nothing.
I thought we had a tail. Blue sedan
made the last two turns with us.
But it peeled off now.
So, what do you think?
The guy by the car that day?
It looks like Da Kine, but...
Mamo, Listen. Take your time, okay?
This is important.
I think your father showed me this picture once, too.
I can't be sure.
Danny. Danny, Danny.
Black hat.
That's one of the guys that broke into my house.
Gun!
Gun! Gun! Down!
Who paid you to break into McGarrett's house?
Who you working for? Hiro?
You working for Hiro?
Is that who sent you, was it Hiro?
Shonin, is he dead?
No. But when I find you, you will be.
So, uh, were those bullets for you or for your boy?
I don't know, but we got to put a security detail
on him.
I got HPD on it now.
You get anything off the shooter?
No.
Chin traced that phone?
Yeah, it's a disposable.
We got no name, we got no location.
It was Hiro.
Okay. You spoke to the guy once--
already recognize his voice?
Yeah, well, some things in life you don't forget.
Okay, so you know, I have an amazing, amazing amount
of respect for your memory, all right?
But without hard evidence--
hello-- without hard evidence,
we cannot... not go after Hiro or his brother,
and I am sure your father was in the same position
18 years ago.
Hey, listen to me, I'm not father, okay?
I don't have a wife and kids to protect.
That doesn't give you license
to go out and do something stupid.
Like what, put bullets in Koji and Hiro's heads?
Yeah, that would qualify.
All right, you heard the boss--
we'll take whatever we can get.
Drugs, guns, cash, paperwork.
Bag it and tag it and get it back to HQ.
Hey, you two, come on, come with me.
Let's go.
Five-O!
We're seizing all this as evidence!
We need to get all this out of here.
Go through these bags.
This garbage is from the club.
You know, I never would've left the island,
I never would've joined the Navy
or missed every holiday, every birthday,
half of Mary's life.
The day that car exploded, it made me who I am.
Danny, I can't just let it go.
I'm not asking you to let it go.
I want to get these guys as bad as you do.
And we will, we will, 'cause Hiro is getting sloppy.
Waikiki, broad daylight, a shootout on the beach?
Come on.
Yeah, I know, he's desperate.
He's desperate and stupid.
All right? We will catch these guys slipping, I promise you.
We just got to wait and keep eye on 'em.
They will make a mistake.
Yeah, when they do we're gonna be there for it.
Kono, tell me you got something.
You won't believe this-- I found your dad's toolbox
in the dumpster out back.
The only thing is, it's empty.
All the evidence that was inside is gone.
Okay, listen to me, print it inside and out.
This may be the piece evidence that connects Hiro
to the break-in and to Mary's abduction.
Yeah, you got it.
Guess there must be a hole in the security, Koji.
Security's good,
it's the members we got to worry about.
You Koji?
McGarrett, the governor know you're here?
Yeah, she knows.
She knows everything.
Tell me something.
My father was the intended target, right?
You didn't mean to kill my mother, right?
You screwed up, tell me that.
Nice fantasy.
But you don't have any proof.
No evidence at all.
No, I got no proof.
No proof of my mother's murder.
But Mary's kidnapping...
that's where we got you.
You like that glove?
Hmm? That glove, it fit good?
I mean, I think it looks nice.
I think you should just use it more often,
like when you're handling stolen property.
You know what I mean?
You touched it. You opened the box,
you got rid of the evidence,
but you just had to see what my father had on you, didn't you?
What are you looking at him for?
Don't look at him-- it's not his fault.
It's not your fault, Koji.
Huh? I mean, he did a terrible job of ditching the evidence,
but you, you are the idiot
that left your prints all over the lid.
You're under arrest.
Play through for me, McGarrett.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
A lot can happen in a couple of hours, you know what I mean?
It's jail, it ain't the Ritz.
Come on.
I know you rigged that car, I don't have any proof,
but I will.
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.
I'm gonna be on you 24/7.
I'm gonna dig up every skeleton in every closet,
and then I'm coming after you.
You, what's your name?
Wo Fat.
The game's over, go home.
Yes, sir.
Now boarding, Flight 7013 to Los Angeles,
gate number six.
This is so stupid.
I didn't even want to be here.
Now I don't want to go.
It was kind of starting to feel like home again.
What are you talking about?
This is always gonna be your home.
But while Koji's a free man, and until this is over
and I know it's safe for you to be here...
I'm having a deja vu moment.
It's just like before,
when Dad brought both of us here,
put us on different planes back to the mainland.
I haven't talked to you in ten years.
And I never saw Dad again.
We're gonna see each other again, okay?
We will.
You promise?
Yes, I promise.
Come here.
Final boarding call for Flight 7013 to Los Angeles.
All passengers must be on board at this time.
Call me when you land in L.A., all right?
I will.
Bye.
Have a good flight.
Thank you.
Bye.
Where you been? I called you on your cell.
I had to drop Mary off, and then I lost track of time.
I'm sorry about that, man.
You got to give her credit.
I mean, she was on to something.
All this stuff in my father's toolbox--
it's not just about my mom's case.
There's a bunch of other stuff that's much more current,
like the investigation he was involved in
before Hesse killed him.
We've got a bunch of leads to follow up on here.
Yeah, well, there's something we don't have
to follow up on now.
What?
Hiro's brother Koji was found dead an hour ago.
How?
Car accident.
You believe that?
