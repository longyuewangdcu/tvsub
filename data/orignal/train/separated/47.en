I was the same way, bad things just happen.
No rhyme or reason.
But, sometimes there is a reason, it's just not a reason you can see.
Umm, this is wonderful, you have to give me the recipe.
Thank you.
I may not see the air is polluted,
but that doesn't mean it's not.
I may not see the poison in the ground
but it's still there.
I went to Alicia because we didn't cause this Laurie
this was done to us.
So, do you have any questions?
Who else signed up?
The pesticides were buried here and here.
A hundred and two families affected in all.
I've spoken to half so far
and I'll speak to the rest by the end of the week.
And what happens if I do sign?
Then we'll bring suit to J&L Pesticides
they were negligent.
They could have disposed of their Chlorodine reserves properly.
Instead, they buried them near your groundwater.
This won't cost you anything. My firm only makes money if we are successful.
You can come.
I wanted three girls.
I was an only child and I wanted noise in the house...
lots of noise.
I'm twenty-six years old and I will never have a baby.
Never.
Are you a mom?
Yes I am
If you're planning to sue these people,
I'll do whatever you want I'll testify whatever you want, cry whenever you want
but it's not for the money.
I want them to know that they hurt me.
OK?
OK.
Would you excuse me?
She's a good one.
I know.
Yeah?
How's it going?
Good but slow. Everybody's wary here.
They'll climb aboard when they smell the money.
I don't think so. It's a conservative neighborhood.
They don't like lawyers.
That's why I sent you.
We got the preliminary report back of the core samples.
It's looking like this could reach pretty high.
$55 million.
You're kidding.
Nope. You're going to change a lot of lives out there.
Just keep signing them up. Call me when you're done.
What did she say?
She said we're good.
How sweet. You two have made up.
Isn′t it adorable? So, are you on board?
If it means getting Bond out, I am.
Otherwise, I am out the door headed to another firm.
It's about getting Bond out.
There's only one way to replace a name partner--
a majority vote of the equity partners.
The next partner meeting is Friday.
Bond thinks I'm on his side, so he won't expect anything.
And then Diane asks for and end-of-the-meeting good faith vote.
Bond will think I'm just being spiteful.
So he won't have time to line up his troops.
And you have the votes?
Well, we have my people, Will's people and yours, right?
Family Law's? Sure, they're ready to lynch him.
An unfortunate choice of words.
We need to get Julius into this
so it doesn't look like the racist white partners...
Oh, please.
What do you mean, oh, please?
I'm worried we're soft on four votes:
Wolf, Adams, Howard, Neka.
Minus those four votes,
we're short of a majority.
So we get them back on the reservation.
Back on the reservation?
Isn't Neka half Cherokee?
Look, the only thing equity partners care about is year-end bonuses.
So we need to give them a piece of this new class action.
$55 million is a lot of incentive.
Are you sure the $55 million is real?
It's a consent form, Julie.
Just a formality for the court.
I like you, Mrs. Florrick.
But that was my friend Gail on the phone.
She thinks I should listen
to this other lawyer before I decide.
What other lawyer?
At Annette's house.
Right now?
Do you mind if we tag along?
Looks like we have competition.
I don't know who it is.
False alarm.
The other firm sent a car and driver.
Talk about tone-deaf.
This community's gonna hate him.
I just don't like the feeling we're being exploited, that's all.
There are a lot of lawyers out there
just looking to make a quick buck.
But I know what it's like to be exploited.
People see you as a victim, and they want to use that.
They don't see pain
unless it's something that can packaged and sold.
Look at me.
Oh, hi, Julie, Rosanna.
And Mrs. Florrick.
She asked if she could drop by, too.
Now, now, don't want any lawyer fights in here.
No, no. Mrs. Florrick and I are old friends.
Aren't we?
We are.
Louis was just telling us he has...
Tardive dyskinesia.
It's a neurological syndrome.
If you see me moving like this or like this,
don't think Ms. Florrick has me worried.
In fact, I'm glad Alicia's here.
I know I should probably be telling you
she's the devil incarnate,
and her firm is going to screw up your class action,
but we're both very capable lawyers,
and I think you should just go with the firm
that you think has your best interests at heart.
And who is your firm these days, Mr. Canning?
Well, that would be me.
I'm it. One employee.
Low overhead.
This crumb cake is incredible.
And the town car and driver outside,
who pays his salary?
I guess I do.
I... I can't drive anymore.
I wish I could, but...
I need that, to have a driver.
That's okay.
My brother was in an accident last year.
A taxi ran over his leg. He can't drive either.
That's terrible.
This is what I love about
coming into homes like this-- is the acceptance.
This is what America has more than any other country--
acceptance.
So you're working for the pesticide industry now.
Why would you say that?
History.
Last time we met,
you gloated about helping big pharmaceutical.
Yes, and you defended the wife-killer Colin Sweeny.
So you save JNL money by stealing our class action
and negotiating a lowball settlement.
Very smart.
Mrs. Florrick, you seem like such a nice woman on the outside,
and then I get this glimpse of the darkness within.
You're going to have
to try harder this time around. I'm on to you.
It helped you in there.
They loved it when you attacked my car.
There can only be one class action.
Yes. I'll see you in court.
No! No!
Yes. Just consider it foreplay.
Well, then you have to find it.
Yeah, what's up?
Oh, I have this deposition...
Then there's this continuance...
Well, don't worry about it.
The judge will never...
No, no.
All right, I'll be right in.
You know what I think? I think you're gay.
I think your gay lover phones every time
we're about to have sex and calls you away.
Oh, yeah?
I'll have you two over for dinner sometime.
All rise.
Good morning. And welcome.
Uh, before we begin today,
I want to remind everybody about the... blood drive.
I don't want to hand down any declarations,
but blood supplies are low,
so I leave it to you and your conscience.
Now, I understand that we have a disagreement
over a class certification.
Ms. Lockhart, you are looking formidable today?
Yes, Your Honor.
We represent the community of Fallstrom
in their suit against JNL Pesticides,
over a recent infertility and miscarriage cluster,
and we're asking you to certify our class.
And yet there seems to be an overlapping contention.
Mr. Canni-- Canning, is it?
Yes, Your Honor.
Hello.
Hi.
Being new to your court,
I should probably explain a few things.
This movement that you see,
I have a syndrome called Tardive Dyskinesia,
and it results in these uncontrollable movements.
That's good to know.
My sister-in-law suffers from Huntington's.
Huntington's. Oh, my gosh.
Yes, it requires a bravery that I couldn't imagine.
I commend you, sir, for even being in this court.
Oh, no, please...
One foot in front of the other.
I very much doubt that.
Oh, dear God.
And so you want to represent this class, is that right?
Yes, I've signed up several of the neighbors in Fallstrom,
and I believe I'll be
the strongest advocate in the case against JNL.
Your Honor,
until very recently, Mr. Canning was in-house counsel
at MRG Pharmaceuticals.
For the last eight years,
he successfully defeated class actions
identical to this one.
It is our contention that he is a Trojan horse
helping to certify this class in order to destroy it.
So, Mr. Canning, is that true?
Are you a Trojan horse?
Well, I definitely like being compared to anyone in Homer.
But, no, sir.
For the last eight years, it's true,
I have worked against people like Lockhart & Gardner
and worked to demolish class actions like this one,
and I was paid handsomely for it.
But six months ago I quit.
I sold my stock options and I went out on my own
because I saw the error of my ways.
I'm here representing myself as an advocate for this class
precisely because I used to be on the other side.
Well, uh, I can only certify one class,
so the members of the losing class
will join the ranks of the winning
and the losing lawyers... or lawyer
will be dismissed.
So, in four days time, i would like both law firms to return
and whichever has the most members in their class
will be certified.
That's, uh, that's all.
Oh, and don't forget, if you're a blood owner,
become a...
Blood donor.
Where are we?
We're up by six households.
Our life is numbers these days.
Okay, $55 million depends on getting signatures,
so let's go.
We're broke.
We have cash on hand
for three staff members through the election.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
Always recruited by the losing team.
Yes, but we're the underdogs; we're hard to dislike.
And why do I get the call?
How have I shown myself deserving?
We heard you quit Eisner & Gowan, Wendy's polling firm.
So we naturally assumed that you were unhappy.
We need a cheap pollster,
and we thought you'd like the chance to get back at them.
Okay.
They were lying to her,
telling her she had the youth vote sewn up.
And she doesn't?
Mm-mmm.
Are you saying that she's weak on the youth vote?
No. You're strong.
See, I was doing a focus group during the last debate.
You were just bumping along in the low 20s.
And then you swore, and -- boom.
I mean, not with the 55-year-olds,
but the under 30s.
It was like watching a baby chick's eyes open.
You shot to low-70s and you stayed there.
Kids thought it was honest.
But it's the youth vote.
Yeah, yeah, and they never show up, right?
Except...
Yep.
The new ballot measure.
Medical marijuana.
The youth vote is showing up to vote for Amendment 31.
We need to stop running away from prison.
See, Wendy gets points because she's black,
but she's like Donna Reed black.
You've been to prison.
And that makes you hardcore.
Matt, come work for us.
I don't know. I was liking daytime TV.
Well, we're gonna put a nice big television in your office.
These are the houses Canning signed up.
And the blue ones are ours.
So we are up seven households.
Are they open to hearing about Canning's background?
Well, I have an ambassador in the neighborhood -- Rosanna.
She says that people like Canning personally.
But they are open to hearing about collusion.
A class action takes a lot of money.
My guess is he's not bankrolling this himself.
I'll look for ties to JNL.
Good. And you'll get back in the field.
Quarterly partner meeting.
Is something up?
Something's always up.
Thank you all.
Good to have everyone here and healthy.
And let's all applaud Philip.
I heard twins.
Good thing. That bought you a delay in the Diocese depo.
Now for the current state of our big-ticket items...
How is everything with the Fallstrom pesticide dump?
We're in process. Lining up our class.
Good. I heard there was a bump in certification.
Judge Abernathy.
He's being -- as is his wont -- cautious.
But we should know more by Tuesday.
Anything on your end, Derrick?
I guess now's as good a time as any.
I just got the go-ahead to announce our newest client,
Americans for Growth.
A new bipartisan Super-Pac
with guaranteed financing of $120 million.
Canning just leased a four-story brownstone on the Gold Coast.
20 grand a month.
Leased?
So he's only here temporarily?
I'm checking.
I'm also going to see if he cosigned his lease.
Okay. Good job.
Sorry about that.
Hi. Are you the reporter that called?
Yeah. Is he in?
Uh, no, but he's gonna be right back.
Come in, though. Come in. Thanks.
He's been preparing all morning.
And you're his...?
Wife. Simone.
And you are...?
Kalinda. Hi.
Um, he said to make yourself at home
and to answer any questions you had.
You can leave your coat right here.
And I have some hummus and pita downstairs I'm going to get.
Thank you.
Yeah.
So tell me, how long have you two been married?
I don't think I'm gonna answer that one
because I'll be showing my age.
Let's just say we were high school sweethearts.
So, is this more about work or home?
Both really.
Okay, fire away.
"Is his condition hard on us?"
"Do I have to carry him down the stairs?"
I'm sorry, I don't mean to...
You're not prying at all.
It's totally fine. We're used to it.
No, no, no, guys.
Can you just stay out of Daddy's office?
Thank you. That's Jay and Bella.
They're not used to these Chicago winters.
Oh, can I get you a drink?
Actually, could I use your bathroom, please?
Sure, it's right there.
I'll be right back.
Sure.
Okay.
Hello.
Hi. I'm Kalinda.
So my wife says. Louis.
Are you getting what you need?
Well, sort of,
but, I mean, anything you can help
with this profile. Would be great.
Oh, it's okay.
I know there's no article.
I've been expecting you.
Or someone like you.
Someone from Lockhart/Gardner.
So, are you finding what you're looking for?
I-I don't know.
What, what should I be looking for?
Something to use against me.
You have, you have a nice brownstone.
Yes, yes, I'm-I'm rich.
Guilty.
Gee, I think the concern is how you got rich.
Oh, you mean from screwing the little man?
More or less.
Oh, no, Woody Guthrie's crying.
You, um, you don't seem too bothered
by my being here, do you?
I'm only bothered by things I don't expect.
Can I ask you a question?
Do you think people can change?
Do I?
No, I don't.
So, once a corporate lawyer, always a corporate lawyer?
Well, I think that six months is a very short time
to go from victimizer to victim.
Saint Paul did it in a second.
Oh, so you're Saint Paul?
No, I'm just someone who thinks
Lockhart/Gardner is just this side of incompetent
and is gonna lose a lot of money
for some very nice, deserving people.
Hey, hon?
Yeah?
Tell Kalinda why I quit my job.
Oh, I don't think she wants to hear any of that, hon.
Sure, she's a reporter, of course she does.
Course I do.
Okay, um, well, uh, Louis was amazing.
I miscarried,
and that day he quit.
I'm sorry, sorry to hear that.
He decided he wanted to stay home and help me.
I'll just let you guys talk.
Nice to meet you.
You, too.
Think that might be why I want
to help a class action of women who miscarried?
I don't believe you. It's a trick.
It's kind of an elaborate trick having your wife miscarry.
No. It's either not true
or it's irrelevant.
He's in the pocket of the corporate interests, believe me.
I think he's getting in your head.
I think you're right. It's still a trick.
Okay, I'm gonna check into 27 Equity.
I'll call you back later.
Okay.
Will?
I hate being my mom.
Oh, hi.
Hi! Do you hate that, being your mom?
I'm not really my mom.
I didn't think I was either.
Everything I did, I ran in the opposite direction.
Have some pastrami.
That's okay.
My mom spent half her life
in tears, cooking dinner,
waiting for my dad to return home.
And here I am.
And where is he?
Oh, um, I think...
I warned him: There was a meeting.
fall for me and I'm outta here.
Now look at me.
Go ahead, there's two.
Come on.
So, what's the point?
I don't want this.
What do you want?
I...
I don't know.
Sometimes it's best just to remain friends.
That's what I found.
So this is a very serious issue
that doesn't get enough attention.
There is a measure that I would support
that takes medical marijuana seriously.
I've seen firsthand the damage
our drug policies-- if you can call it that--
has done to our court system, our families, to lives.
$100 now, $200 later.
Mm-hmm. Okay.
All you have to do is call me
when you see this car enter that garage.
Okay, I'll give you a call.
Thank you.
You lost two.
Who?
The two I was worried about, the Hathaways and the Wicks.
I was just heading over there.
How did he know to go to them?
I don't know, but he went to them first thing.
He visited Julie this morning, too.
Please come in.
I know Mr. Canning visited,
but before you make any decision,
I just want to chat...
That's okay.
I want to sign with you.
Oh. I'm sorry.
Then that's great.
I just don't like how this back and forth
is hurting the neighborhood.
I know. It'll be over soon.
And I didn't like what he was saying about your firm.
He...?
What did he say?
I finally found a use for this nanny-cam.
I know her firm-- Lockhart/Gardner.
In normal economic times,
they would be exactly the type of firm you'd be looking for.
But right now they're undergoing a partnership battle
for control of the firm.
And the partners need this class action
in order to fight for that control.
I didn't know if it's true,
but I thought I should bring it to you.
You didn't say anything?
No.
Then how...?
There's a mole.
I mean, listen, half the convicts I knew in prison
were there because of drugs...
Not too many hits.
It'll grow. Peter's the first one even talking about it.
What does this do for our older constituents?
It's a dog whistle. No one else hears it.
But, uh, here,
I don't know what to do about this.
Who's that man walking down the street?
Peter Florrick!
Who's that man you'd like to meet?
Peter Florrick!
That's right, that's right. He's here to fight!
What the hell?
It gets worse.
Peter is the man, Peter is the right man Peter has a plan,
Peter has the right plan
He's not black, he's not white.
He's got a plan to make it right.
Who is it?
Neil Howard Sloan-Jacob.
He's a supporter.
Our supporter.
You ask for civilian involvement,
and this is what you get.
Sing it loud, we're not just one, we're a crowd Not just you,
not just me, we're the Peter family!
It's been zipping around the college blogs.
It has more hits than Peter's speech.
He promises to make a new video every week.
God, it's like a hostage crisis.
Peter has the right plan
Eli, you know the worst thing to happen to any candidate?
It's to be unhip.
Ask Hillary in '08.
I'll contact him.
Hey.
Peter is the right man! Whoa!
I know who to talk to.
About this? Really, I'm on it.
No, no, no, about helping us with the youth vote.
Who?
A guy I met in prison.
I don't get it.
How did he know about our partnership fight?
It's not just that.
Canning's been one step ahead of us all week.
Yes, but only you and I knew this.
Rosanna.
Rosanna was here earlier
when you went upstairs for your partner meeting.
You think she overheard us and then
slipped it to Canning?
I don't know.
I'll see if she flipped.
Anything on who's financing Canning?
It's not JNL Pesticides.
It's this-- 27 Equity,
a New York hedge fund.
Oh, my God, it's the newest thing in litigation.
They did the same thing last year
with the Ground Zero workers.
The lawyers borrowed $35 million
to finance the lawsuit.
The interest was astronomical.
15% a year.
So if he isn't in the pocket of JNL, the why's he doing this?
I think there's a chance he's sincere.
Doesn't matter.
We still need to beat him in court.
How did you communicate with Rosanna?
On the phone, through e-mails.
Let me check your computer.
Yeah.
Your car just showed up.
It's not much of a cushion being up by two people.
It's all we need.
All rise.
Thank you all for returning promptly.
Court is now in session.
And where are we on the class overlap? Mr. Canning?
I think some of the Fallstrom neighbors
haven't decided yet, sir.
Yes, Your Honor, but of the neighbors who have,
we have a majority: 41 to 39.
No, no, actually, I believe were tied at 40.
At least when I count my letters of consent.
Is that true, Ms. Lockhart?
Mr. Gardner?
I think the dust is still settling, Your Honor.
But what is true is a matter that came to our attention:
just today Mr. Canning colluded with JNL Pesticides
at their company headquarters.
Really? Colluded?
Mr. Canning?
It's true, Your Honor,
I visited JNL at their invitation
to see what kind of deal could be made.
I must admit I was too busy bargaining with JNL
to follow opposing counsel.
But I did manage to come away with an offer of $2 million.
Your Honor, this suit is worth 20 times that amount.
I-I don't know if that's true,
but I do know that $2 million is considerably more
than what's currently on the table: zero.
Mr. Canning, it was not within your purview
to negotiate on behalf of the class action.
And I didn't reach out to JNL. They reached out to me.
Because this is a sweetheart deal.
Even if what Ms. Lockhart is saying is true,
isn't it better that a Trojan horse like myself
get whatever deal can be made now
instead of waiting the five or six years...
Objection, Your Honor.
...for the $50 million they're hoping for?
Lockhart/Gardner's position is to fight.
And they make enemies of their opponents.
I make them my friends.
Because you intend to lower the deal!
I intend to get a deal! A fight takes time.
Ask your clients if they're willing to risk that time.
Why don't we make a deal now?
All right!
I'm glad to see you've all given blood.
Let's not spill any more here.
It is within my purview to marry these two classes,
and that is what I intend to do.
But, Your Honor...
No, no, no.
No.
Mr. Canning, Ms. Lockhart, Mr. Gardner,
look across the aisle to each other.
Look.
By the powers vested in me by the State of Illinois,
I now pronounce you one class.
Congratulations.
Get a good deal.
I don't care if he says we're married.
We are in charge.
Okay. Well, we'll make the best deal we can. Okay?
You going for a quick run?
Maybe not so quick.
Look. I'm sorry about dinner.
We've just got this thing and...
Hold on.
Hey, Kalinda. What's up?
It's not a leak.
What-What do you mean? What is it?
Why Canning is ahead of us.
He put Spector Pro on Alicia's laptop.
That's keylogger software.
What?
Every key Alicia hit
was sent through a Wi-Fi parasite program
to another computer.
That's how Canning knew.
Can we prove it?
Well, we can trace it back,
but he'll know we're tracing.
You want to use it?
Alicia, send an e-mail to Diane
saying our geographical report
places the target amount at $70 million.
Okay.
You want to chase up the offer?
Then have Diane write back saying we're willing
to take it to 85 million.
If Canning's in bed with JNL,
they'll be terrified.
Okay. Will do.
Okay, call me when you're done.
Okay. I'll go for a jog with you.
I have a date tomorrow night.
You... You what?
I have a date with a South African soccer player tomorrow night.
You do not.
I do. Picking me up at 8:00.
Think he's gonna come in one of those cute little soccer uniforms?
I don't care how he comes.
I don't understand.
Are you breaking up with me?
No. Just putting things on pause.
I'm not falling in love with you.
I know.
I just need a little cooling-off period. 30 days.
That's all.
No. You told me not to fall in love with you,
and I didn't.
I know.
30 days. I'll call you at the end of February.
You okay?
Am I...?
Yeah. Why?
Well, I just asked you what you thought
a good compromise come-out offer was,
and you said, "Yes."
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm distracted.
I...
Life is complicated, isn't it?
It can be.
I don't know what I want.
I'm very good when I know what I want,
but when I don't,
I suck.
Is this work?
It's...
Nothing.
I need friends.
I need, like, a fat buddy
who I can tell things to and get drunk.
I'll work on that.
Will? Do you have a minute?
It'll just be a minute.
I think we need to talk to Diane
about backing away from litigation.
Why?
I think she's letting her leftist activism
get the best of her.
A year ago that might have been true, but not now.
Take over the pesticide case.
Why? It's not mine to take over.
She's pushing for an $85 million deal.
She'll never win.
How do you know that?
How do I know she won't win?
How do you know she's looking for $85 million?
I know.
You can't tell me how?
Trust me.
My information is solid.
Alicia wanted her to come in at $70 million.
Diane pushed it to 85.
Okay, I'll talk to Diane.
Good. Thanks.
Get out of here!
I will not get out of here.
Peter asked me personally to ask you...
personally.
No! No! No! No! That does not happen!
That does happen.
And it's happening to you.
I didn't think anyone even saw that old video.
But I knew I had to do something.
Well, it was very entertaining.
Well, that was the whole point, you know?
I mean, people think that politics can be so dry,
but I think it can be fun.
So what is this position?
Oh, well...
it's the liaison to the political director--
me.
And I can send you anything?
Song ideas?
Commercials?
Or ways to make the Glee songs for Peter?
Yes.
We've been trying to get the public involved,
get them to coordinate with our message.
So yes, send everything to me.
And you don't think it's better if I just do it on my own?
No. It's-it's better if it comes through my office.
And I'm sorry we can't offer you
a stipend at this time,
but if things work out...
No, no, I want to keep my day job.
This is just so great, Mr. Gold.
Please tell Peter that I think he's amazing.
By the way...
Why did you do this for Peter?
Why?
He spoke at the school about bullying.
About making fun of kids.
He said people see someone who's different than them,
and they never get a chance to really know them.
And the only way to make life rich is,
next time, have lunch with them.
Well, he said it better than me, but
the week after that, I could just feel
that the mood here... was different.
I never thought words made much difference.
Just music.
But he changed people.
Not for that long, just a few days.
And music can't do that.
So that's what makes this so great
is that I will be working for him.
It will be great.
Nice meeting you, Mr. Sloan-Jacob.
Yes, Mr. Gold.
I only covered the 27th floor desktops.
28th floor was off-limits.
I found keylogging software on Alicia's desktop,
Julius Cain's, and Neka's in Litigation.
Now, given that wide of a distribution,
it's more likely to be Bond spying than Canning.
Two equity partners and one
junior associate. Why Alicia?
Her close connection to me?
That would be my guess.
He wouldn't want to put keylogging software on your computer,
but he wanted to keep track of what you wrote to Alicia.
What did you tell her?
Alicia?
About this? Nothing.
Thank you, Kalinda. I think we need a moment.
No. I think Kalinda should stay.
She can help us.
I think we should do the same thing
we were planning to do with Canning.
Use it?
Yes.
Diane, you write to Julius
about getting to Bond's weakest votes.
Get him to fire his own people?
Yes. We need the majority
of equity partners to vote Bond out.
We can't pick off his votes.
But he can.
I think I'm liking this.
It's gonna be hard to go back to the law.
So you just got out of prison?
Yeah. November.
Eight months.
Heard that you got caught up for a while?
Home monitoring. It's not so bad.
Yeah, I've been there.
How's your mom?
Oh, she's hanging in there. Yours?
She hates my last album.
So, uh, do you miss anything about it?
What? Being inside?
God, no.
You are funny.
Foolish question.
So, um, I guess I owe you one, huh?
No. No, hey, the legal advice was free.
But it was damn good advice.
Better than anything I've gotten on the outside since.
I'm glad.
So, what do you need?
I need the youth vote.
I'm sorry.
Hey, I told you, brother-- that tatt--
nice black panther right there-- you'll get my vote.
Well, I was thinking maybe just an interview.
You and me.
An interview?
Yeah. Oh, that all?
I mean, I thought we were talking about a fund-raiser.
Uh, sorry. I was just passing by.
Um, what-what kind of fund-raiser?
Just so we're clear.
We didn't consider the offer made to your co-counsel, Mr. Canning,
to be a lowball offer.
We consider it to be our offer, our best, last and final.
Well, how nice for you.
Then we'll see you in court.
Good. Okay, wait.
Wait. Look, we're not trying to pick your pockets.
We just need to show the judge a hint of movement.
No, we don't.
Yes, actually, yes, we do.
Mr. Canning, can we talk to you a minute?
Good job. Nicely played.
Oh, don't even pretend.
What? We're good cop, bad copping them.
No, we're not.
You're undercutting us.
We'll contest any lowball offer.
It's a lucky world where $2 million
is a lowball offer.
Don't worry. We're doing great.
Don't you just look at them and feel something?
Excuse me?
Those mothers.
They miscarried.
They can't have children.
Don't you feel something when you hear them,
or is your cynicism that deep?
Mrs. Florrick,
you don't know me.
You don't know what my life is.
I may have the greatest compassion for them in the world,
or I may have none.
It's irrelevant.
What I owe them is not my compassion.
It's my ability.
And that's what I'm giving them.
Canning got Rosanna to flip to his side
by showing her a document from JNL Pesticides.
What kind of a document?
An internal analysis of what they were willing to pay.
Does she have a copy?
No. He just showed it to her.
Then it doesn't matter.
He'll claim it's privileged, part of negotiations.
No. He can't.
Sure, he...
We got to get to Judge Abernathy.
Okay, okay.
Please don't put me in the position of refereeing everyone.
We had our settlement offer accepted.
$2.4 million,
with one million in reserve for future claims.
That offer was made to Mr. Canning, and not...
Okay. You don't have a deal, Mr. Foxson, until the court
certifies a deal.
Now, who is this witness?
Mr. Carl Hobart, Your Honor.
And what will he testify to?
An exhibit we would like to place into evidence.
Okay. So, proceed.
Mr. Hobart, what is your job?
My job? I am a claims analyst with 27 Equity.
And that is a hedge fund?
Yes. And you were recently sent a document by Mr. Louis Canning?
Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, Mr. Canning,
you can't object to your own co-counsel.
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.
I think
I'll overrule that on absurdity alone.
You may answer.
Yes, I was sent a document for review.
As collateral for Mr. Canning's loan?
Yes.
Uh, we loaned Mr. Canning $4 million for this lawsuit,
so we needed to see all relevant documents.
And this document under discussion
was prepared by JNL Pesticides
stating how much they were willing...
Objection! Objection!
Your Honor, this document was part of evidence,
and is, therefore, privileged.
It, therefore, cannot be used in court.
That would be true, Your Honor,
except that Mr. Canning pierced his own privilege
by showing this document to a hedge fund.
Now, he can't have it both ways.
Either it's privileged, or it's not.
And now... it's not.
Your Honor?
That seems a particularly good point,
Mr. Canning. You can't pick
and choose when privilege applies.
Do you have anything else?
No, Your Honor.
Okay, I'll admit it. Nicely played.
Thank you.
You still have to make a deal.
My guess is it'll be easier now.
So, that was all cynical, right?
You were just trying to lower the amount of the award?
I think people were harmed here,
and I think companies ought to pay for their mistakes.
But I think companies are paying too much for their mistakes,
and I think lawyers are helping people
distort the amount of harm.
That's all.
So, if that's cynical, then...
I'm a cynic.

How was your South African soccer player?
Fictional.
I don't know what this is. I...
I don't like needing... anyone.
I know.
It's not commitment.
It's just preferential treatment.
I can deal with that.
Mmm! You smell like you.
You smell like Will.
I thought I could do without it.
But you have to be more gentle with me.
I'm not as tough as I look.
Okay.

We're climbing with the 18 to 25 year-olds.
Congratulations.
Suddenly I'm hip.
I never thought you weren't.

he's going to do a benefit concert for me.
