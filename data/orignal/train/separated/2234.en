There is a town in Maine...
I'd like a room.
Welcome to Storybrooke.
Where every storybook character you've ever known...
is trapped between two worlds...
An evil queen sent a bunch of fairy tale characters here.
And now they don't remember who they are.
Victims of a powerful curse...
Everything you love, everything all of you love,
will be taken from you.
Only one knows the truth,
and only one can break her spell.
It's your destiny.
You're gonna bring back the happy endings.
You enjoy your stay.
Nice shot, Chief.
I betcha 20 bucks you can't do it again.
Next round's on him.
Emma, what can I get you?
Nothing.
What the hell?
You could have hit me.
I never miss.
You've been avoiding me...
since last night when you saw me.
"Leaving the Mayor"?
And, yes, that is a euphemism.
I'm not avoiding you, Graham.
I just have no interest in having this conversation.
It's your life, and I really don't care.
If you don't care, then why are you so upset?
I'm not upset!
If that were true, you'd be at the bar with me
having a drink and not running away.
It's none of my business, really.
Can we please talk about this? I need you to understand.
Why?
I don't know. Uh, maybe so I can understand.
You need analysis, go talk to Archie.
I wanna talk to you.
Well, your bad judgment is your problem, not mine.
You don't know what it's like with her.
I don't feel anything. Can you understand that?
A bad relationship? Yeah. I understand a bad relationship.
I just don't wanna talk about yours.
Look, I know you and Regina have your own issues,
and I should've told you about that before you took the job.
Yeah, why the secrecy?
We're all adults. You can do whatever you want.
'Cause I-I didn't want you to look at me the way you are now.
Why do you care how I look at you?
Because...
What?
What the hell was that?
Did you see that?
How much have you been drinking?
That was way over the line.
I'm sorry. I just-
What?
You what?
I need to feel something.
Listen to me, Graham.
You are drunk and full of regret. I get it.
But whatever it is you are looking to feel,
I can tell you one thing.
You're not getting it with me.
Graham.
Is Henry asleep?
Yes. Why?
Good-bye, Father.
I'm so sorry, Snow.
I loved him so much.
So did I, dear.
So did I.
The loss I feel for my husband must be nothing compared
to the loss you feel for your father.
If there is anything I can do,
please let me know.
I may only be your mother through marriage,
but I'm here for you, dear.
Truly and forever.
Congratulations.
Your revenge is almost complete.
One down...
One to go.
She has no idea, does she?
That I'm responsible for his passing?
She sought comfort with me.
Sickening.
I could have ended her miserable existence right there.
Believe me, it was tempting.
It would have sated your soul.
The kingdom's still loyal to her.
They would turn on me.
They don't know the wretchedness inside her as I do.
They don't know what she did to me.
We must be delicate in this next phase.
Her demise must be handled with care.
Perhaps one of your knights, your majesty.
No.
I need someone adept at murder,
bereft of mercy.
Someone with no heart.
Now you understand.
Well, in that case,
you need a huntsman.
You have died so that I may live.
Forgive me.
Your sacrifice is honorable.
I thank you.
Don't worry, boy. You won't go hungry tonight.
What is it?
I had the most intense dream.
I was... in the woods, hunting,
and I killed a deer. There was a wolf.
A wolf?
Its eyes--
one was blood-red, and the other was black as night.
The funny thing is...
I think I've seen the wolf before.
Go back to sleep, Graham.
It was only a dream.
Didn't feel like a dream.
It felt like a memory.
Graham.
I need some air. I need to think.
Graham, please. Come back to bed.
I left my car at granny's anyway.
I need to go and get it, clear my head.
Graham, listen.
It's late.
You're tired. You're probably still drunk.
Don't leave.
Since when do you want me to stay anyway?
You're not well.
I'm fine.
Really?
Oh! Hey, wait. What are you doing?
If Graham thinks flowers will work on me...
No, those... were mine.
From David?
No. Uh...
Dr. Whale.
Why would Dr. Whale...
Are you serious?
I know. It's a disaster.
No. That's amazing.
You're getting over David.
Mm, first of all, there's nothing to get over,
and second of all,
it's just a one-night stand.
Not according to those flowers.
Yeah, maybe I shouldn't have called him.
Oh, my god. You called him?
That is definitely not a one-night stand.
Well, okay, I'm still learning. I...
I've never had one before.
I feel guilty.
Why? There's nothing wrong with what you did.
Trust me. One-nighters are as far as I ever go.
Yeah, but that's because you're...
Because... I'm what?
Never mind.
No, tell me. What do I do?
You're just protecting yourself...
with that wall you put up.
Just because I don't get emotional over men.
You don't get emotional over men?
Uh, the floral abuse tells a different story.
What story is that?
The one that's obvious to everyone except, apparently, you,
that you have feelings for Graham.
Come on.
There's that wall.
That's not a wall.
Really?
There's nothing wrong with being cautious.
Oh, true. True.
But, Emma, that wall of yours--
It may keep out pain,
but it also may keep out love.
Good morning, Sheriff.
Sorry if I startled you.
Right.
Sorry. I-I thought you were a wolf.
Did I forget to shave?
What are you doing out here so early?
A spot of gardening.
Yourself?
I was looking for a--
A wolf. Yeah, I think I'm beginning to catch on.
You know, to the best of my knowledge, Sheriff,
there are no wolves in Storybrooke--
Not the literal kind, anyway.
Why are you looking?
You'll think I'm crazy.
Try me.
I saw one in my dreams,
and then I saw one for real,
just a few hours ago.
Did you, uh, did you see anything unusual out there?
I'm afraid not.
I do wish I could be more helpful.
You know, Sheriff...
They say that dreams--
Dreams are memories...
Memories of another life.
Uh, wh-what do you believe?
I never rule out anything.
Good luck, Sheriff.
I do hope you find what you're looking for.
They're letting animals in here now?
This isn't a slaughterhouse.
Forget him. He might as well be one, too.
I heard he was raised by 'em.
He does smell like 'em.
Pathetic. I heard he cries over his kills.
You believe that?
Tell me, huntsman.
What kind of a man cries over an animal?
An honorable one.
What do you know about honor?
I have it. They have it.
You don't.
Animals have it?
They're pure of heart,
not selfish and self-serving like... people.
You tell him to stop threatening me.
'Cause you know what I do to pets that threaten me?
I hang 'em on my wall.
He's not a pet.
He's perfect.
Bring him to me.
What do you want?
Mary Margaret?
Can I talk to you?
Graham.
What's the matter? Are you okay?
I think we, uh...
I think we know each other.
Of course we do.
No, no, no, not--not from here.
Not from Storybrooke.
From where, then?
Another life.
Do you have a name?
Or shall I just call you "the huntsman"?
You're a tortured one, aren't you, huntsman?
Is this because your parents abandoned you to the wolves?
Those weren't my parents.
All they did was give birth to me.
The wolves are my family.
Wolves, indeed.
I always felt there were two kinds of people...
Wolves and sheep.
Those who kill and those who get killed.
And you, huntsman,
you are most certainly a wolf.
Why am I here?
I'd like you to kill someone for me. Can you do that?
I kill for me. Why would I do anything for you?
Because I have so much to offer--
a place at my court.
You will become my official huntsman.
I'm not interested in being a pet.
This place is a cage.
You'd be awash in luxury,
wanting for nothing.
You have an army at your disposal.
What do you need of me?
My prey is beloved by all the kingdom.
I need someone who won't be blinded by that--
someone without compassion.
Someone...
Who will have no qualms carving a heart out
and bringing it back for my collection.
That's me.
As I suspected.
Now tell me...
What will it take, hmm?
What do you want?
There must be something.
Outlaw the hunting of wolves.
They're to be left alone.
They are to be protected.
Simple enough.
So who do you want me to kill?
Mary Margaret, how long have we known each other?
Um... I don't know. A while.
Do you remember when we met?
No.
Me neither.
I can't remember when I met you or when I met anyone.
Isn't that odd?
I don't know.
I mean, I suppose.
But... But, you know, that's just life.
Things get hazy.
Have I ever hurt you?
Oh, Graham, no. Of course not.
What is going on?
Do you believe in other lives?
Mm, like heaven?
I mean, like past lives.
You've been talking to Henry.
Henry?
Well, he has this book of stories.
He's been going on about how he thinks
we're all characters from them-- from another land,
and we've forgotten who we really are.
Which, of course, makes no sense.
Right.
No, of course.
Graham.
You are burning up.
Go home and get some rest.
I think you'll feel much better after you've had some sleep.
Right.
You're absolutely right.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
And thank you.
Of course.
You know, when I was a little girl,
The Summer Palace was my favorite place.
The mountains surrounding it felt like... A cradle.
They always made me feel safe.
I look forward to returning to it now.
Stuffy in there?
Here.
No.
You're not a knight, are you?
What makes you say that?
Without fail,
Every one of my father's men has offered me condolences...
Except you.
Please accept my condolences.
And they all know how to wear armor.
She picked you to take me.
Why?
I think you know.
You're going to kill me.
You have good instincts.
And you have too much armor.
Our tax dollars hard at work, I see.
Graham isn't here.
I assumed he'd took a sick day... with you.
Oh, so you're aware of us. Good.
That's why I'm here.
Because I'm also aware of your relationship with him.
I don't have a relationship with him.
Oh? So nothing's ever happened between the two of you?
You forget, Ms Swan.
I have eyes everywhere.
Nothing that meant anything.
Well, of course not,
Because you're incapable of feeling anything for anyone.
There's a reason you're alone, isn't there?
All due respect,
The way I live my life is my business.
It is until it infringes on my life.
Stay away from Graham.
You may think you're doing nothing,
But you're putting thoughts in his head--
Thoughts that are not in his best interests.
You are leading him on a path to self-destruction.
Stay away.
Hey, Sheriff.
My mom's not here.
Actually, uh, I'm here to see you, Henry.
I was hoping you could help me.
Help you with what?
It's about your book.
Am I in it?
I hunt you, yet you stop to compose a letter.
I will never understand your kind.
I don't know these woods.
You're obviously a skilled hunter.
You'll find me.
No matter what I do, I know how this ends.
Yes.
There's one thing that I ask that you do
after you kill me.
Please deliver this to the queen.
Your tricks won't work on me.
It's not a trick.
Please, give it to her.
Tell her I mean every word.
Sound this when you need help.
What?
It's a whistle that will bring you aide.
You'll be led to safety. Now go. Run.
I don't understand. You're not going to kill me?
Run.
Well, when did your flashes begin?
Right after I kissed emma.
You kissed my mom?
What did you see?
A wolf.
I saw that I had a knife in my hand,
And I was with mary margaret.
Were you about to hurt her?
Yes. How do you know that?
Because Mary Margaret...
is snow white,
which makes you...
The Huntsman.
So you really think that I... could be another person?
Makes total sense. You were raised by wolves.
That's why you keep seeing one.
It's your friend, your guide.
It's trying to help you.
I'm remembering this because I kissed your mother?
How is that possible?
Well, you two do have a special connection.
She owes you her life.
Why?
Snow white's her mother,
and you spared her.
If you hadn't...
My mom wouldn't have been born.
Well, what happened after I spared Snow White?
The Queen took your heart.
She ripped it out. It's kinda her thing.
She never wanted you to be able to feel again.
Let me see that book.
What's that?
I saw that, too. The wolf was howling at it.
That's her vault.
That's where she put your heart.
The wolf wants me to find it.
Thank you, Henry.
I hear you're having a rough day.
Who says?
Pretty much everyone.
I think maybe you need to go home and get some rest.
I'm fine.
No, Graham, you're not fine.
You just went to see a 10-year-old for help.
He's the only one making any sense.
What's going on?
What's... really going on?
It's my heart, Emma. I need to find it.
Okay.
So... how are you gonna do that?
I just need to follow the wolf.
What? What wolf?
From my dreams.
He's gonna help me find my heart.
I'm sorry. I...
thought we were talking in a metaphor here.
You really think you don't have a heart?
It's the only thing that makes any sense.
It's the only thing that explains
why I don't feel anything.
Listen to me, Graham. You have a heart.
I can prove it.
See?
It's beating.
It's real.
Feel that.
That is your heart.
No. It's the curse.
You can't really believe that's true.
What?
Graham! Graham, be careful.
He's my friend. He won't hurt us.
What is it?
It's my heart.
It's in there.
I have to look in there.
Oh, no. Stop, stop.
I have to get in there. Please.
Graham, come on.
You really think that your heart is in there?
Okay.
Let's find out.
Come on!
Wait here.
I see you're still in mourning.
The time for mourning is over.
I simply found that black suits me.
Now tell me.
Is Snow dead?
The young girl's heart, as you requested.
First, there's something I must do.
What's this?
The girl wanted you to have it.
Read it to me.
Dearest stepmother,
By the time you read this, I will be dead.
I understand that you will
never have love in your life because of me.
So it's only fitting
that I'll be denied that same joy as well.
For the sake of kingdom,
I hope my death satisfies your need for revenge,
Allowing you to rule my father's subjects as they deserve,
with compassion and a gentle hand.
I know what you think you're doing is vengeance.
I prefer to think of it as sacrifice,
For the good of all.
With that in mind, I welcome the end.
I want you to take my last message to heart.
I'm sorry, and I forgive you."
Don't tell me you're becoming a sheep.
She put others before herself,
And yet you hate her.
What did she do to you?
I shared a secret with her,
And she couldn't keep it.
And that betrayal...
Cost me dearly.
Now...
Show me her heart.
It should open.
This isn't her heart.
This isn't a human heart!
What did you do?
It's got to be in here...
Somewhere.
There's gotta be a hidden door.
A lever...
Something.
Graham. Hey, Graham.
There's nothing in here.
There has to be. And if there isn't, then...
It's okay.
It's going to be okay.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
What are you doing here?
Bringing flowers to my father's grave
like I do every wednesday.
Don't blame her.
It's my fault. I wanted to look in there.
Really? Why?
What were you looking for?
Nothing.
It was, uh... it was nothing.
You don't look well, dear.
Let's take you home.
No, I...I don't want to go home.
Not with you.
Oh?
But you'll go with her.
Hey, this is between you two.
Leave me out of it.
She's right.
It's between us, and things have to change.
And I wonder why that is all of a sudden.
It has nothing to do with her.
You know, I've realized that
I don't feel anything, Regina,
and I know now it's not me.
It's you.
So you're leaving me for her.
I'm leaving you for me.
Graham, you're not thinking straight.
Actually, for the first time, I am.
I'd rather have nothing than settle for less.
Nothing is better than what we have.
I need to feel something, Regina,
And the only way to do that is to give myself the chance.
Graham.
I'm sorry.
It's over.
I don't know what I ever did to you, Ms. Swan,
to deserve this--
to have you keep coming after everything I hold dear.
I told you, it's not her.
None of this happened until she got here.
I'm sorry, but have you ever stopped to think
that maybe the problem isn't with me, but with you?
Excuse me?
Henry came and found me.
Graham...
kissed me.
Both were miserable.
Maybe, Madame Mayor,
You need to take a good, hard look in the mirror
and ask yourself why that is.
Why is everyone running away from you?
Regina!
Stop!
Stop, stop! Aah!
Not worth it.
Graham.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what came over me,
how I lost my mind.
It's okay.
You were tired and feverish...
and heartbroken.
I don't know why I let myself get caught up with her.
Because it was easy and safe.
Not feeling anything's an attractive option
when what you feel sucks.
Felt that.
Did you think you can fool me with the heart of a stag?!
You're not going anywhere.
She doesn't deserve to die.
That's not up to you.
I wanted a heart,
And a heart I shall have.
What are you gonna do to me?
You're now mine.
My pet.
And this is your cage.
From this moment forward,
you will do everything that I say,
And if you ever disobey me,
if you ever try to run away,
all I have to do is squeeze.
Guards!
Your life is now in my hands...
Forever.
Take him to my bed chamber.
All better.
Yeah.
What?
Graham?
You okay?
I remember.
Graham?
I remember.
You remember what?
Thank you.
Graham!
Graham!
Graham?
Graham! Graham!
Graham!
Graham!
Graham! Come on, graham!
Graham!
Graham.
