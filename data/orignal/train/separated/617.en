It wasn't meant to be this way. You know?
We make our plans, sure.
But life...
Life is what happens to you along the way.
You know, at first, I didn't want this.
I didn't want to connect.
I didn't want to get involved.
And she kept on at me.
"This is what life is. This is why we're here,
to connect.
To build."
We're here to build something.
And then we had Theo.
And then I understood that she was right.
We're not meant to be alone.
You know what she said to me?
She said that even the most damaged heart
can be mended.
Even the most damaged heart.
No, I'm with Vic.
What?
I can't let you in until Alphonse is home.
Alphonse is on his way.
Where?
In the basement.
Paulie.
No.
It's Paul.
¿Por qué no alarma esta pecada?
Yo que dije que siempre la tengas puesta.
Élla dice que no la pagó.
Go.
"719, now you realize."
What?
What the fuck? This shit is crazy.
Now he's killing us.
Call the locksmith.
And get that asshole from the alarm company over here.
"Now you realize."
I know who's doing this to me.
Killed for less.
A little uncouth to come without a call.
There's a better place for you to be.
Get out. Go.
Am I gonna get paid?
Have you seen this man?
Paul? Everyone knows Paul's missing.
I want you to think before you answer.
'Cause I'm getting to the bottom of this.
The bottom of what?
Three months of letters.
Three months of torment.
Not being able to leave my house without wondering
if some coward is gonna sneak up behind me and...
Paul was looking into this.
And I think he found exactly what he was looking for.
But before he could come and tell me,
my friend Paul shows up
strangled in my freezer.
You've got a lot of enemies, don't you, Alphonse?
Three months ago you and I had our disagreement!
I raised my take to 25%
to allow you to continue to operate in my buildings.
I started getting letters three months ago!
That's no fucking coincidence!
That's not fucking accurate!
You asked for 30%, and Lon told you,
you could only ask me for 20%.
So if anyone was bent out of shape,
it was fucking you, Alphonse.
Who's in this picture?
I don't fucking know.
Who the fuck is in this picture?
I don't know!
What am I supposed to realize?
What does 719 mean?
What am I going to fucking realize?
What am I gonna fucking realize?
Darcy, want to give me a hand here, mate?
He ain't got shit to do with this!
I've been picking up from Harry for over a year.
No. He's a fucking liar
so you shut the fuck up.
I'm gonna ask you again. What am I supposed to realize?
I don't care what you think I've done to you,
you are not sanctioned to kill me.
That much I do fucking know.
So it's not on, you even coming here!
"Not on"?
The term is, "Not cool."
It's you fucking English.
You always do shit like that.
Alphonse, just...
You also make your sevens like this.
You
are not sanctioned
to kill me.
Fuck it.
What the fuck y'all waiting for?
Do it.
Fuck, you've been hit.
Don't worry about it.
A bit better this time.
Will you be all right to drive yourself home, Beatrice?
Pourquoi tu vas pas te présenter à lui?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais, maman?
You're supposed to lie down and relax.
I was relaxing so much I saw a white light.
Well, if you see it again, don't walk into it.
I still have a lot of things to take out on you for my childhood.
It's beautiful.
I love the color.
Moi aussi.
It's very pretty.
I'll run your bath.
T'arrête pas de le regarder. Demande-lui de sortir!
Sors.
Vis ta vie.
T'as une vie, après tout.
Hello?
Hello?
I got your note.
Vas-y!
Mais parle sur le balcon.
I,
I wasn't sure you got it.
I was wondering if I put it in the wrong box?
No.
No. It's mine.
So...
The note.
I just thought since we...
I thought it would be nice to finally meet you.
Beatrice.
Victor.
No, thanks.
You don't talk a lot.
Not much, no.
It's okay.
I talk enough for both of us.
I talk too much. Everybody says so.
You speak French?
I'd like to.
Yeah?
Sure.
Another language?
Hungarian.
You're Hungarian?
You don't have an accent.
I worked very hard to get rid of it.
So...
A job?
I'm...
Right now I'm dabbling in real estate.
The people I work for, they buy buildings in need of renovations.
Fix them up and run them.
You? A job?
Yeah.
I was involved in a car accident last year.
I was a beautician before.
They rebuilt part of my face.
But it's kind of hard to give advice on beauty now.
And...
I have to smile a lot in my job.
Most of the time, it hurts to smile.
I don't get to smile so much in my work.
No?
No.
Maybe you and I should switch jobs.
Yeah.
So, what else?
I swear sometimes.
Especially when I drink.
Me too.
Fuck.
Shit.
Careful. You're smiling.
Tonight it's worth it.
I want to take you somewhere.
So where are we going?
Are we going to a club?
No.
No?
Very cold.
Very cold.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, then are we going to a park?
Warmer.
I thought you talk a lot?
I thought you don't.
Must be the company. Usually, I don't.
You can turn here.
Pull over. Just there.
You're afraid I'll think you came tonight
because you felt sorry for me.
You don't have to play these games, Victor.
I know why you really came.
You're just being careful.
You want to find out
if the girl who's been watching you saw what you did.
I saw you kill this man.
I saw you strangle him.
I saw you take him away.
Now you're trying to clean up a mess that cannot be cleaned up.
But, I...
I think your secret will be safe with me.
This is the man
who hit my car when he was drunk.
This is the man who did this to me.
I want you to kill him.
As you did with the man in your apartment.
Wait a minute.
No.
If you don't do it,
I'll call the police and tell them what I saw.
What the fuck are you...
His BMW.
It's fixed.
As if it had never happened.
But I can't be fixed.
He served three weeks.
Three weeks for what he did to me.
Stupid judge, he sat there and he looked at my face.
I want it done.
If you don't do it,
I'll call the police and I'll tell them what I saw.
You'll do it!
You want to save yourself? Do it!
Fuck.
He didn't pay.
I understand.
He didn't pay.
Stop saying that! I understand!
Are you gonna do it?
What I did, it has nothing to do with you.
You have to do this!
He ruined my life.
I have nothing. I am nothing.
I want it done as soon as possible.
Then I will forget.
I will begin my life.
And I will forget that I ever met you.
Do you know what it is to kill a man?
I will forget that I ever met you.
It's not a bug! It's not a rat!
I would never kill a bug or a rat!
He's much worse than these things!
You don't know what you're getting into with me!
You have no fucking idea!
I could have called the police.
I saved your life.
Now you're gonna give me back mine.
If you're not going to kill me you don't have a choice.
T'es déjà de retour?
Béatrice
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé encore?
Béatrice
Laszlo.
Sorry I'm late.
No problem.
You look good.
It's good to see you.
Were you worried I was going to forget your name?
Convention. You forget what it's like.
It's Andras who gave us the body for your grave.
Whose body?
Someone who deserved it, I'm sure.
Is this where the whores are kept?
No, no, you are looking for your mother's boat.
Two down.
We met.
Two days after when they left you for dead.
Yeah.
Soviet modified Dragunov.
Shoots 7.62 by 5.4 rounds.
With all Russian PSO scopes.
Comes with bayonet suppressor as well.
Heavier than I expected.
I'll take it.
Okay. All set.
What did he say?
Andras?
For 14 months you've infiltrated Alphonse.
They wanted to know
why you've been waiting for so long to do what needs to be done.
He said if he was lucky enough to be standing, like you are,
he'd want revenge, too.
But we're all worried you wait too long.
Always kill the devil quickly when you find him.
That was his advice.
I said you wanted to be close enough to watch him suffer.
But I really don't know the reason you're waiting.
So now...
Now.
Say it in English for me.
I...
tied...
Yes?
I tied...
Yes?
my shoe. Today.
You tied what?
My shoe.
Your shoe?
Bigger smile than that. That's not the biggest smile you have.
So?
Nothing. No one has seen your brother.
It's been two weeks, I am telling you.
He never goes more than a few days without calling me.
You know him. Sometimes he likes to get away.
No. Something is wrong.
What have I done to you?
Where have you taken me?
I need foodstuffs.
I can help you.
If you let me go, he will spare you.
My brother, he will not stop looking for me.
And he will find you.
Even if you get his money,
even if they pay,
he will find you.
You don't know who you're messing with!
He will kill you!
He will kill you!
Monster's here.
Monster!
Hey, monster...
If you put a bag over your head,
we might hook up with you.
You have to take off your shoes.
My mom likes to keep the floor clean.
How long will it take?
Long enough to be prepared.
You say he goes to this bar every night?
Yeah.
You know where he works?
He's looking for work.
As much as I could find out, I did.
I never thought about it before.
Revenge.
But when I saw you kill that man in your apartment,
I knew I had my answer.
Why did you do it?
I just want to know more about you.
I'm not here by choice.
We have company.
She can't hear us. She lost most of her hearing as a child.
Oh, j'ai oublé mes cookies dans le four.
Mais c'est sorti, maman.
Ah, d'accord.
I'm looking for my hearing aids.
Maman, je te présente Victor.
Hello, Victor.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Well. You look good.
You want to stay for lunch?
We're having chicken. Lemon chicken. It's very good.
And cookies, too.
We love cookies in this house.
You want cookies?
I can't stay, madame.
I want to show you something.
Pictures of Beatrice.
You can see she has excellent genes.
Elle est belle, hein?
You see how beautiful she is?
Alors, je vais vérifier votre poulet.
Ouah, il a l'air
très très bon.
I want it done as soon as possible.
Maman?
Yes.
Victor has to go.
Au revoir, Victor.
It was nice meeting you.
Ah, j'ai oublié.
You'll hear from me when it's done.
Cookies.
It's for you. Take them.
A bit grumpy.
Mais oui, j'ai un bon sentiment.
Crackerjack.
Got any grass?
That depends.
Information is power, my friend.
You see anyone take a photo up there?
Already told.
Already told who?
Another guy. A guy like you.
This is my friend Paul.
Did you tell him?
Hello.
It's Lon.
You know, people are flipping out.
You weren't sanctioned to do Harry. Or his men.
Or leave a house full of dead Jamaicans!
No, I told you...
Can you try to imagine...
Look, Lon.
Imagine what the fuck I'm dealing with?
No. You need to come see me right now.
You don't appreciate the severity of this.
You come now. I'm gonna be at Cafe Cora.
So... We got dead Jamaicans?
I'm listening.
Well, Lon,
for the last three months, Harry was messing with me.
Trying to freak me out.
Sending little notes like this with pictures,
and threats and fucked-up shit.
I don't think he was too happy with the percentage deal.
Okay.
I went in there to get answers,
not dead Jamaicans.
Turned out that way.
I lost two guys.
And truth is, I could have been just as dead as both of them.
You know Joe Bragg? And Herbert?
Lowell Khan. And Weinberg?
They're my colleagues.
Yeah.
Each
received photos like these.
Yeah?
Yo, Vic. Where you at?
I'm in the middle of something.
Hey, listen, I was right.
Alphonse is still in danger.
This was not Harry and his men doing this shit.
How do you know that?
You know Cafe Cora? Can you get there?
I can find it.
Yeah, look, Alphonse is there with Lon Gordon.
I'm gonna call the rest of the crew
and get them down there, all right?
How'd you know it wasn't Harry?
I'll be there in five.
Fuck.
Yo, Terry.
Yeah?
I'm gonna look at these photos another way.
'Cause whoever's doing this is taking it seriously enough now
to let us know that the loans to you, they're not secure.
That's respect enough to let us know his intentions.
You're not gonna be around.
You may not be around to collect.
Lon, that's exactly what Harry wanted you to think.
I got a note, too.
This morning.
It's addressed to you.
Englishmen and Jamaicans, they don't send notes like this.
Not after they've been killed in their own house.
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
And this key was taped to it.
You know what that key is for?
I want you to get the books
and the deeds together for me now, all right?
Every building you owe us for.
You understand this, don't you?
So the uptown buildings, you're pulling out of the deal?
We're not pulling out, Alphonse.
You're just in no condition right now to pull in.
Shit!
Alphonse...
Not right now.
There's a problem.
We need to go.
He's here.
What?
Oh, shit!
Blotto's down. Get the shit!
Jesus! Get down!
Darcy! It's coming from the roof!
Get in the car!
Up' there!
Go, go, go!
Get the fuck out of here!
Luco! You watch the elevator!
Dolph and Charles come upstairs!
Kilroy, back stairs with me! Now!
Darcy, he got out from the fifth floor.
What?
He went out the window!
From the fifth fucking floor?
He's crazy.
Darcy!
What the fuck? Shit! Fuck!
Victor?
Shit!
Where is he?
They wasted Goff.
They wasted Charles, too.
Over here! Come on!
Get in!
Come on!
Over here!
Come on!
What the fuck are you doing?
Turn the fuck around! Turn the fuck around!
What the fuck!
Hi. I'm Beatrice.
You told me to get here.
I'm sorry I made him late.
What's going on?
See you later.
Did you see anyone running here, Vic?
No.
Shit!
He took out Blotto, Goff and even Charles.
Who?
We lost him.
Fuck!
You guys all right?
Tell him what you told me about the cab.
This guy in the building,
he saw a man take this photo from the stairwell.
Then they see him get into a cab. A gypsy cab.
Paul was there, too. He found out the same thing.
It must've led him to something, because he was wasted for it.
Find out where the cab went.
What did you do that for?
What I do what for?
Go looking with the pictures.
You've only been on this crew a month longer than I have.
What if all this shit that's happening to Alphonse
is because of something that went down before you came?
This is an opportunity of magnumus proportions to me.
How's that?
Of finding my next step in the organization.
Yeah, well, there might not be much of an organization left.
I could run this place for him, Victor.
Better than Terry, a whole lot better than fucking Kilroy.
I ain't joking around.
If I could just crack this shit for...
This is serious shit, Darcy.
Have enough money to buy Lise and Theo what they need.
Move up the ladder.
What the fuck!
It's Lise's car. Mine's in the shop.
What? Are you back with her?
Yeah, she's acknowledging me.
It's a start, right?
I promised her I'd make a plan. Get ahead.
For her and for Theo.
Just don't get too smart.
You saw what happened to Paul.
I don't want anything to happen to you.
I'm smarter than Paul.
I'm tired of being taken for a fucking douche.
I saw Alphonse respected me back there.
Yeah?
I saw it in his eyes.
All right. We're good.
That's it.
Go on.
What the fuck.
I tied my shoe today.
I tied my shoe today.
I tied my shoe today.
Hello.
This is Victor, is Beatrice...
Hello. This is Victor. Is Beatrice there?
C'est quoi?
Je sais pas. Y a rien de réponse.
Hello.
It's me.
I believe you have something of mine?
Yeah.
Why did you follow me?
It's not the first time.
I wanted to find out more about you.
I think it's lucky I did.
You want some water?
Sure.
So, who are you?
My real name is Laszlo Kerik.
I was born in Hungary.
A few years ago my wife and I came to America.
I was an engineer before.
We came here looking for work.
We took an apartment in a building.
It was a building they wanted to control.
The man I saw?
They got most people out of the building.
One night they came and they fired some shots.
To scare us.
So we would leave.
A bullet went through a wall,
and my daughter was killed while she slept.
We were going to testify. My wife and I.
The man responsible for it all, Alphonse,
he gave his orders to make sure he never went to trial.
And they were followed.
He was afraid to use his own guys,
so they sent a crew of Albanians after us.
They killed my wife,
and they thought they killed me, too.
And they should have made sure of it.
Cigarette?
Yeah.
When I manage to forget what happened to me,
when there are no mirrors, and no people that reminds me,
when my mom makes me laugh.
In these moments,
I have hope.
Maman says that I...
That it's these moments that makes the pain bearable.
These moments.
I should try and find them where I can and hang onto them.
But they're fleeting.
And then I remember,
and I'm filled with so much hate
so I want to set the whole world on fire.
I'm sorry I made you tell me about your family.
I don't want to be one of those people that reminds you.
When you're the one who is going to help me forget.
These men, they don't seem easy to beat.
And you might have used up all your luck. So...
It's yellow.
Chartreuse.
Keep it.
I need you around.
Rabbits don't come in chartreuse.
Did you eat the cookies?
No.
Maman makes a good cookie.
I only ask you to return the Tupperware.
She likes her Tupperware.
Have you made any progress?
I will.
I know.
Because I realize now that
if I call the police and tell them what I saw,
it's not prison you're afraid of.
It's that you won't get to finish your revenge.
I'm going to sleep in my own bed.
And why are you going to sleep in your own bed?
Because Daddy keeps care of the monsters.
Why, baby? Tell me once more, why?
Because Daddy keeps care of the monsters.
Bigger smile than that! That's not the biggest smile you have.
And why are you going to sleep in your own bed?
Because Daddy keeps care of the monsters.
Why, baby? Tell me once more. Why?
Because Daddy keeps care of the monsters.
I'm so happy that you're here.
I just needed some time, Florence.
Now I'm going to cry.
I was worried when you didn't contact my friend.
Nicholas, the therapist.
He really did wonders helping me out.
He could help you.
I found someone else.
As long as you're getting the help you need.
I'm in good hands.
You clever motherfucker.
Open the fucking windows. It's fucking hot in here.
Hey, Kilroy, you want something to eat?
Yeah, I could eat.
I'm in my office.
Anything going on?
No.
Any pick-ups?
Make sure you keep your cell on.
I don't know what Al's got going.
Are you sure it's the AR 43?
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm looking at it right here.
It was installed two days ago.
Then there is nothing wrong with your remote.
There's a barrier. Your signal won't get through.
The AR 43 is an IR unit
that is used in most banks and government buildings.
What is the application for your trigger?
Warehouse.
That's interference.
You will have to be inside the IR ring, or forget it.
Unless you start from scratch, go to a new system.
No, I can't do that. Not enough time.
Too much interference. You would have to detonate inside.
You lost a wife and a daughter.
But don't forget.
I lost a niece and her little one.
I don't want to lose you, too.
Now you know everything.
No. No, I don't.
How come an engineer knows so much about guns?
Military service. Back home.
So, what you said on the phone. Is that your plan?
To get everybody into this warehouse?
Yes. Alphonse is always there.
I just need to get the Albanians there, too.
There are many men.
But your bombs doesn't work.
They work.
That's one way of looking at it.
Another is that you don't care if you get out of there.
You'd rather die than fail.
Don't worry about it. I'll be around long enough
to do what you asked me to do.
I don't want you to do that. Bring me food.
My mom likes to cook. It would just go to waste otherwise.
I'll wedge it in between the mustard
and those plastic explosives.
You may not care if you get out alive,
but in the meantime, you should eat.
My rabbit's foot. If you don't believe in it, I'll take it back.
Bye.
Sign right here.
Ilir.
Where did you get this?
A delivery came.
Same bogus return address again.
They have your brother.
There's a little girl.
Hello?
Hey, it's Fonz. Listen.
I found this lawyer.
He says he can close the financing on those uptown buildings.
And he don't know anything about Lon pulling out.
Is this guy clean?
Yeah.
He wants to see the Commerce Building.
So I'm gonna meet him there tonight at 9:00.
I don't know, man. What if our problem shows up?
Pulls some fucking "I don't know" Kind of shit.
No, you're the only one that knows.
I gotta go.
Yeah.
Yo, Vic. You with anybody?
Yeah. I'm busy.
Well, drop your dick.
I found the gypsy cab.
The guy at the cab company says he remembers Paul.
Paul was there.
I'm like a detective, man.
Like Columbo. I'm scaring myself.
Vic? Right.
I'll be right down.
Hey, Vic. Vic. This girl you're seeing.
She your girlfriend?
No. No, it ain't serious.
She's got... Her face.
Yeah. Car accident.
Did it affect her?
You have no idea.
Hey, you never mentioned her before.
You embarrassed about me?
Yeah, I'm embarrassed about you.
You're embarrassed about your friends?
Fuck you talking about?
So. This is it right here.
The cab dropped off Paul right here.
You're sure?
Yeah.
They keep a track, drop offs, pick-ups.
All right, detective? Can we leave now?
A cemetery?
That's creepy.
The office is closed tomorrow. But I could call them.
Maybe I'll come by with a picture of Paul.
See if anybody knows anything.
All right.
Fuck.
Come on. I gotta get out of here.
Everything okay?
Yeah. I just got some business to take care of.
Come on in.
So what did you tell Darcy?
Your text said not to tell anyone I was coming.
I told him I was...
Had something to do.
Here's your food.
I set a trap, Victor.
I said whoever walks through that door at 9:00
was going to have a real bad night.
The person doing this to me, he's hurt.
Someone who lost someone.
Like the people in the picture.
And he's in a great deal of pain because of that.
And it's a pain that I've caused.
Then he kills Paul.
And found he was in both feet.
Victor, I want him to know something.
I want him to know that
if there's anything left in this world that he still cares about,
I'm going to find it.
And I'm gonna burn it down.
He's probably wondering right now what I'm thinking.
What my plan is.
And how much I know.
Wouldn't you be wondering what I'm thinking?
I would.
You know, you're the only one I can trust, Victor.
You know why?
No.
Because you saved my life at Harry's.
It would be something, though.
If you saved my life only to be the one who kills me.
Have a seat.
I must stand, please.
They're outside.
The other day you told me that if I helped you...
Yes!
Believe what I say, my friend.
I don't know, my boss...
He will not know.
You guarantee that?
That I won't be harmed?
I swear to God. Please.
You're asking me these things,
so I know you've been thinking about it.
About me in here.
All right.
Listen to me. You're in the city. All right?
You're in the basement of my boss's warehouse.
His name is Alphonse. Alphonse Hoyt.
I don't know what your brother or his men did to him,
but they're gonna kill you whether he pays or not.
I got a camera.
You can record a message for your brother.
I'll make sure he gets it.
We gotta go fast.
Tell him where you are.
It's important you tell him where you are.
I swear to you.
Speak.
Ilir! Ilir!
I'm alive, brother. I don't know for how much longer.
They're going to kill me.
Even if you pay them the money, they're going to kill me.
They're holding me in a warehouse that belongs to Alphonse Hoyt.
I beg you. I beg you, brother, come quickly.
A warehouse that belongs to Alphonse Hoyt.
Alphonse Hoyt!
Thank you. Thank you.
I promise you.
We killed you. We killed you all!
We killed you all!
I swear on their graves, you didn't.
I swear! I swear on their graves, you didn't!
No, no, no! No! No!
No, no, no! No!
Don't let me die like this! Please! Please!
Don't let me die!
Please have mercy! Please!
Don't let me die like this! Please!
Yo, I tracked down the manager.
What manager?
From the boneyard.
I thought it was closed today.
He's gonna be here in 15.
Says he needs to feed some fish or some shit.
I can meet him alone, if you're busy.
No, no, I'll be there.
All right.
All right.
Fuck!
I need to send this package.
But I gotta take care of something I didn't count on,
so can you send it for me?
Yeah.
What is it?
You don't need to know what it is.
I need to know what it is.
What is it?
It's a video. It's one of the Albanians saying something
I need him to say to the person I need him to say it to.
All right?
Okay.
You need to get a tracking number. With alerts to my cell phone.
Yeah.
All right.
Thanks.
Wait.
Tell your mother it was very good.
Yeah?
Not too salty?
No.
It was perfect.
Hey, this shit's coming together.
Paul was definitely here.
How'd you know he was here?
The manager.
He asked for this.
It's a list of all the people buried here.
The guy said he was more interested in the Hungarian section.
The Hungarian section. Did he say why?
No.
There's hundreds of them.
What happened to that girl?
That girl you told me about across the way from you.
You ever meet her?
Yeah. I met her.
And?
You didn't die two years ago.
They found the cemetery.
They're getting close.
The one who found you before got lucky.
And just because he found the grave
doesn't mean that they will figure it out as well.
You can walk away, still.
Not too late.
I know why you've been waiting so long.
Why you haven't killed him.
I think you're afraid that when it's over,
it won't mend your heart.
Comment je peux résister...
Pure phantasme.
Ouah! T'es belle!
It was going to waste. I just felt like putting it on.
Mais je sais bien pourquoi tu l'a mis, ça.
Enfin,
pour qui!
Hey, monster!
Get out of here! Come on!
What... what happened?
I fell and ruined a nice dress.
Let me see.
You Okay?
Yeah.
At least it wasn't my good side.
I sent your package.
I have your tracking number.
Thank you.
Hello, Victor.
Hello.
Pars tirer ta robe. Il y a plein du sang.
On veut pas qu'il te voit comme ça.
Thank you for returning my Tupperware.
Of course.
People usually don't. Like it comes with the food.
Free Tupperware.
Did you like the food?
Yeah. The food was... It was very good. Beatrice didn't tell you?
She was nervous you wouldn't like her cooking.
I always told her the way
to a man's heart is through his stomach.
One of the ways.
She'll keep you well fed. That's for sure.
You know, this thing, me falling and hitting my head?
Maybe it happened because I lost my rabbit's foot.
The truth is my mom gave it to me after the accident.
She said it was going to bring me luck with my procedures.
I picked the color.
Stupid chartreuse.
Would you go out with me tonight?
Somewhere.
Anywhere.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Laszlo Kerik.
Laszlo Kerik? You know the name?
No. No, I don't know him.
I didn't think you would.
I've been searching every dead Hungarian on this cemetery list.
This shit went down about nine months before we were on the crew.
There was a case involving Alphonse
and a little girl who was killed in one of his buildings.
The case never went to trial. Get this, right?
The little girl's mommy and daddy,
they died, like, two months afterwards.
They're buried right there next to her.
Vic?
You there? Vic? Vic?
Yeah. I'm here.
I did it, man.
I fucking did it.
I found out exactly what Paul must have found out.
Look, I want to tell Alphonse.
I want you to be there when I tell him.
Can you get there?
No, I'm in the middle of something. I'll talk to you later.
Victor.
I didn't know you were coming. I would have thrown something on.
Maman, you knew very well he was coming.
Non, tu m'a dit rien, pas du tout.
Well, I told you so.
Ready?
So...
Where are we going?
You'll see.
A club?
Very cold.
A Park?
Are you okay?
Yeah. Good.
This is... - The bar.
In his house, some credit card receipts.
He usually leaves the bar at 8:30 every night.
But he took a trip.
I want to make sure he's back.
If he's here tonight, he'll probably be here tomorrow night.
I'm prepared to do it then.
I... I've found a moment with you.
I want to hang onto it.
It's not gonna end up that way.
I never said it would.
Not with words.
I wore that white dress for you.
Was that a mistake?
Yes.
All right, wait here. I'll be back in a minute.
What did you do?
It's done.
It's done.
One, two.
Nope.
Hold up. It's this one.
So you're saying it's someone who knew them?
He must have.
'Cause this guy's dead, right?
Right?
What is it?
The little girl died June 17th.
Two years ago. Right?
Yeah.
June 17th is tomorrow.
Beatrice.
What are you doing?
Oh, my God.
Beatrice!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What?
Yeah, I'm walking back to him now. Okay.
Yeah.
Hey, you know who this is, right?
Yeah, I know who it is.
I've been getting these weird letters for the last three months.
With pictures? With the eyes crossed out?
I've been getting them, too.
Whoever is doing it took my brother.
You remember this problem I had you take care of for me?
Hungarian Rhapsody?
You stayed to the finale. Right?
Yeah.
And the whole family took a bow?
Yeah.
And you're sure you saw the father take a bow?
Where the fuck have you been? I've been trying to call you.
My car won't start.
Some shit's going down, man.
The fucking thing won't start.
What am I going to tell you?
Come pick me up.
What?
Bring every fucking gun we have.
Ilir Brozi?
Here.
Vic?
You didn't mail the package.
You didn't kill him.
You didn't kill him because you feel something for me.
You knew how I would feel.
You didn't mail the package.
I tried.
And the guy walked away, and I called him back.
I called him back, because I feel something for you.
I could love you.
I don't want you to die.
So I thought that
if I could just mess up one of your things, just one thing,
it would be enough so it wouldn't work out the way you planned.
So I put my rabbit's foot in that package.
And I took the video card out.
They got my rabbit's foot instead.
We can run away.
They'd find us.
We keep on running.
We travel by night. I don't care how far we have to go.
Vic?
Shithole.
Holy shit.
Where are you going? You come back here!
Your father is speaking to you.
Laszlo.
Fucking Laszlo.
I'm gonna wait for you here.
Where are you?
I'm outside your apartment. Come back. Please.
Beatrice, I want you to go to your apartment now.
Go there now, and stay there and wait for me. Okay?
Come here!
If you fucking scream, it will go bang.
Okay?
Okay.
Laszlo fucking Kerik.
You made me a douche, Laszlo Kerik.
I've seen your artwork.
I've seen your fucking pictures.
You put Paul in the freezer.
This has nothing to do with you.
I sent you to my apartment to save you.
All right? You weren't supposed to go inside.
Yeah, but I did go inside. I was worried about you.
I don't want to fucking kill you.
Take this opportunity, and you let her go.
You lied to me. You fucking lied to me.
The godfather of my son.
Let her go. Let her go.
You listen to me. You get in your shitty car that does start.
You start your shitty car.
And you drive your shitty car to Alphonse's.
We'll be waiting.
Fuck.
Get up!
What does it mean?
Darcy's here with the girl.
What happened to your face?
Car accident.
What happened to yours?
You motherfuckers.
Victor.
Alphonse. Don't go anywhere.
Are you coming for me?
No. I'm coming for her.
Yeah, well, she won't be here when you get here.
Oh, shit.
Take her to my room!
And don't fucking move!
Motherfucker! He just shot Luco.
No, look! He's coming up the back stairs.
All right now! I've got something for your ass!
Follow him, Ilir! Down the fucking stairs!
Hey, Victor! Remember I told you
if there was anything left you still cared about,
I was gonna find it and I was gonna burn that shit down.
How about this?
You are dead, fuck!
Hey, where the fuck did you go?
What does it mean?
What is he saying?
What the fuck are you doing, man?
Don't you raise that fucking gun.
Don't you do it! Don't you fucking do it!
Bitch, lower the fucking gun!
Did you choose not to kill me 'cause I got a wife and a kid?
No.
