here we go. pad thai , no peanuts .
but does it have peanut oil ?
i &apos;m not sure .
everyone keep an eye on howard in case he starts to swell up .
since it &apos;s not bee season , you can have my epinephrine .
are there any chopsticks .
no need. this is thai food .
here we go .
thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the 19th century .
interestingly they don &apos;t put the fork in their mouth--
they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth .
ask him for a napkin . i dare you .
i &apos;ll get it .
do i look puffy ? i feel puffy .
hey , leonard .
oh , hi , penny .
am i interrupting ?
no .
you &apos;re not swelling , howard .
look at my fingers. they &apos;re like vienna sausages .
sounds like you have company .
they &apos;re not going anywhere .
so , you &apos;re coming home from work. that &apos;s great. how was work ?
you know , it &apos;s a cheesecake factory .
people order cheesecake and i bring it to them .
so you kind of act like a carbohydrate delivery system .
yeah. call it whatever you want , i get minimum wage .
i was wondering if you could help me out with something .
yes .
great . i &apos;m having some furniture delivered tomorrow
and i may not be here , so ...
hello .
i &apos;m sorry ?
haven &apos;t you ever been told
how beautiful you are in flawless russian ?
no , i haven &apos;t .
get used to it .
yeah . i probably won &apos;t .
hey , sheldon .
hi .
hey , raj .
still not talking to me , huh ?
don &apos;t take it personally , it &apos;s his pathology .
he can &apos;t talk to women .
he can &apos;t talk to atractive woman , or in your case ,
a cheesecake @-@ scented goddess .
so there &apos;s gonna be some furniture delivered ?
yeah . if it gets here and i &apos;m not here , could you sign
and have them put it in my apartment ?
no problem .
great. here &apos;s my spare key. thank you .
penny , wait .
if you don &apos;t have any other plans , do you want to join us
for thai food and a superman movie marathon ?
a marathon ? how many superman movies are there ?
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
i do like the one where lois lane falls from the helicopter
and superman swooshes down and catches her. which one was that ?
one .
you realize that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy .
yes , i know , men can &apos;t fly .
no. let &apos;s assume that they can .
lois lane is falling ,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second .
superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel .
miss lane , who is now traveling at approximately 120 miles an hour
hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces .
unless superman matches her speed and decelerates .
in what space , sir ? she &apos;s two feet above the ground .
frankly , if he really loved her , he &apos;d let her hit the pavement .
it &apos;d be a more merciful death .
excuse me , your entire argument is predicated on the assumption
that superman &apos;s flight is a feat of strength .
are you listening to yourself ? it is well established
that his flight is a feat of strength .
it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings ,
an ability he derives from exposure to earth &apos;s yellow sun .
and how does he fly at night ?
a combination of the moon &apos;s solar reflection
and the energy @-@ storage capacity of kryptonian skin cells .
i &apos;m just gonna go wash up .
i have 2,600 comic books in there . i challenge you
to find a single reference to kryptonian skin cells .
challenge accepted .
we &apos;re locked out .
also , the pretty girl left .
ok.her apartment &apos;s on the fourth floor but the elevator &apos;s broken , so ...
you &apos;re just gonna be done ? okay. cool. thanks
we &apos;ll just bring it up ourselves .
i hardly think so .
why not ?
well , we don &apos;t have a dolly ,
or lifting belts or any measurable upper @-@ body strength .
we don &apos;t need strength--we &apos;re physicists .
we are the intellectual descendants of archimedes .
give me a fulcrum and a lever and i can move the earth .
it &apos;s just a matter of ... i don &apos;t have this .
archimedes would be so proud .
do you have any ideas ?
yes , but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring .
easy ... easy .
ok .
now we &apos;ve got an inclined plane. the force required to lift
is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs ,
call it 30 degrees , so , about half .
exactly half .
exactly half .
let &apos;s push .
see , it &apos;s moving , this is easy .
it &apos;s all in the math .
what &apos;s your formula for the corner ?
what ?
okay , no problem .
just come up here , help me pull and turn .
ah , gravity , thou art a heartless bitch .
you do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds
of you having sexual congress with this woman .
men do things for women without expecting sex .
those would be men who just had sex .
i &apos;m doing this to be a good neighbor .
in any case , there &apos;s no way it could lower the odds .
almost there .
almost there .
almost there .
no , we &apos;re not .
i &apos;m sorry . -no , we &apos;re not !
watch your fingers .
oh , god , my fingers !
you okay ?
no , her ...
great caesar &apos;s ghost , look at this place .
so penny &apos;s a little messy .
a little messy ?
the mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy .
this is chaos .
excuse me .
explain to me an organizational system
where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid .
i &apos;m just inferring this is a couch
because the evidence suggests the coffee table
is having a tiny garage sale .
did it ever occur to you that not everyone has
the compulsive need to sort , organize and label
the entire world around them ?
no .
well , they don &apos;t .
hard as it may be for you to believe ,
most people don &apos;t sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fiber content .
excuse me , but i think we &apos;ve both found that helpful at times .
come on , we should go .
hang on .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m straightening up .
this is not your home .
this is not anyone &apos;s home. this is a swirling vortex of entropy .
when the transvestite lived here , you didn &apos;t care how he kept the place .
because it was immaculate .
i mean , you opened that man &apos;s closet ,
it was left to right evening gowns ,
cocktail dresses , then his police uniforms .
what were you doing in his closet ?
i helped him run some cable for a web cam .
hey guys . hey penny
this just arrived , we just brought this up ... just now .
great. was it hard getting it up the stairs ?
no .
&quot; no &quot; ?
no .
no .
well , we &apos;ll get out of your hair .
okay , great. thank you again .
penny
i just want you to know that you don &apos;t have to live like this .
i &apos;m here for you .
what &apos;s he talking about ?
it &apos;s a joke .
i don &apos;t get it .
yeah , he didn &apos;t tell it right .
sheldon
sheldon
hello
sheldon
penny &apos;s sleeping .
are you insane ?
you can &apos;t just break into a woman &apos;s apartment
in the middle of the night and clean .
i had no choice . i couldn &apos;t sleep knowing
that just outside my bedroom was our living room ,
and just outside our living room was that hallway ,
and immediately adjacent to the hallway was ... this .
do you realize that if penny wakes up ,
there is no reasonable explanation as to why we &apos;re here .
i just gave you a reasonable explanation .
no , no , you gave me an explanation .
its reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers .
don &apos;t be ridiculous . i have no peers .
we have to get out of here .
you might want to speak in a lower register .
what ?
evolution has made women sensitive
to high @-@ pitched noises while they sleep
so that they &apos;ll be roused by a crying baby .
if you want to avoid waking her ,
speak in a lower register .
that &apos;s ridiculous !
no .
&quot; that &apos;s ridiculous . &quot;
fine .
i accept your premise. now , please , let &apos;s go .
i &apos;m not leaving until i &apos;m done .
if you have time to lean , you have time to clean .
oh , what the hell .
morning .
morning .
i have to say i slept splendidly .
granted , not long , but just deeply and well .
i &apos;m not surprised .
a well @-@ known folk cure for insomnia
is to break in your neighbor &apos;s apartment and clean .
sarcasm ?
you think ?
granted , my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox ,
but i think the end result will be a measurable enhancement
to penny &apos;s quality of life -you &apos;ve convinced me .
maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet .
you don &apos;t think that crosses a line ?
yes .
for god &apos;s sake ,
do i have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time i open my mouth ?
you have a sarcasm sign ?
no , i do not have a sarcasm sign .
do you want some cereal ? i feel so good today ,
i &apos;m gonna choose from the low @-@ fiber end of the shelf .
hello , honey puffs .
son of a bitch !
penny &apos;s up .
you sick geeky bastards !
how did she know it was us ?
i may have left a suggested organizational schematic
for her bedroom closet .
leonard
god , this is gonna be bad .
good @-@ bye , honey puffs. hello , big bran .
you came into my apartment last night while i was sleeping ? !
yes , but only to clean .
really more to organize. you &apos;re not actually dirty , per se .
give me back my key .
i &apos;m very , very sorry .
do you understand how creepy this is ?
oh , yes , we discussed it at length last night .
in my apartment , while i was sleeping ? !
and snoring. and that &apos;s probably just a sinus infection .
but it could be sleep apnea .
you might want to see an otolaryngologist .
a throat doctor .
and what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses ?
depending on the depth ,
that &apos;s either a ... proctologist
or a general surgeon .
sacasm
god
penny i think what you &apos;re feeling
is perfectly valid and maybe a little bit later
when you &apos;re feeling a little less ... for lack of a better word--violated ,
maybe we can talk about this some more .
stay away from me .
sure , that &apos;s another way to go .
penny , penny ! hold on
just to clarify ,
because there will be a discussion when you leave ,
is your objection solely to our presence
in the apartment while you were sleeping ,
or do you also object to the imposition of a new organizational paradigm .
well , that was a little non @-@ responsive .
you are going to march yourself over there right now and apologize .
what &apos;s funny ?
that wasn &apos;t sarcasm ?
no
boy , you are all over the place this morning .
i have a master &apos;s and two ph.d.s , i should not have to do this .
what ? !
i am truly sorry for what happened last night .
i take full responsibility .
and i hope that it won &apos;t color your opinion of leonard ,
who is not only a wonderful guy , but also , i hear ,
a gentle and thorough lover .
i did what i could .
hey , raj .
hey , listen .
i don &apos;t know if you heard about what happened last night .
but i &apos;m really upset about it .
i mean , they just ... they let themselves into my place
and then they cleaned it. can you even believe that ?
how weird is that ?
she &apos;s standing very close to me .
oh , my , she does smell good .
what is that , vanilla ?
you know , where i come from ,
if someone comes into your house at night , you shoot. okay ?
and you don &apos;t shoot to wound .
i mean , all right , my sister shot her husband ,
but it was an accident , they were drunk .
wait , what was i saying ?
she &apos;s so chatty .
maybe my parents are right . maybe i &apos;d be better off with an indian girl .
we &apos;d have the same cultural background
and my wife could sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang
to me .
it &apos;s obvious that they meant well , but ...
i &apos;m having a really rough time. like i said i broke up with my boyfriend
and ...
i mean just because most of the men i &apos;ve known in my life happen to be jerks ,
doesn &apos;t mean i should just assume leonard and sheldon are .
right ?
she asked me a question . i should probably nod .
that &apos;s exactly what i thought .
thank you for listening. you &apos;re a doll .
turn your pelvis .
grab a napkin , homie. you just got served .
it &apos;s fine.you win .
what &apos;s his problem ?
his imaginary girlfriend broke up with him .
been there .
hello . sorry i &apos;m late ,
but i was in the hallway , chatting up penny .
really ? you , rajesh koothrappali , spoke to penny ?
actually , i was less the chatter than the chat @-@ ee .
what did she say ? is she still mad at me ?
well , she was upset at first ,
but probably because her sister shot somebody .
but then there was something about you ,
and then she hugged me .
she hugged you ? how &apos;d she hug you ?
is that her perfume i smell ?
intoxicating , isn &apos;t it ?
hi .
what &apos;s going on ?
here &apos;s the thing .
&quot; penny , just as oppenheimer came to regret his contributions
&quot; to the first atomic bomb ,
&quot; so too i regret my participation in what was ,
&quot; at the very least , an error in judgment .
&quot; the hallmark of the great human experiment
&quot; is the willingness to recognize one &apos;s mistakes .
&quot; some mistakes , such as madam curie &apos;s discovery of radium ,
&quot; turned out to have great scientific potential ,
&quot; even though she would later die a slow ,
painful death &quot; from radiation poisoning .
another example , from the field of ebola research ... &quot;
leonard , we &apos;re okay .
six two inch dowels .
check .
one package phillips head screws .
check .
you guys , seriously , i grew up on a farm , okay ?
i rebuilt a tractor engine when i was , like , 12 .
i think i can put together a cheap , swedish media center .
no , please. we insist. it &apos;s the least we can do , considering .
considering what ?
how great this place looks ?
oh , boy . i was afraid of this .
what ?
these instructions are a pictographic representation
of the least imaginative way to assemble these components .
this , right here is why sweden has no space program .
well , it looked pretty good in the store .
it is an inefficient design. for example , she has a flat screen tv ,
which means all the space behind it is wasted .
we could put her stereo back there .
and control it how ?
run an infrared repeater .
photo cell here , emitter here , easy @-@ peasy .
good point.how are you gonna cool it ?
hey , guys , i got this .
hang on , penny .
how about fans ? here and here .
also inefficient , and might be loud .
how about liquid coolant ? maybe a little aquarium pump here ,
run some quarter @-@ inch pvc ...
guys , this is actually really simple .
hold on , honey. men at work .
the pvc comes down here .
maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here .
yeah ? show me where we put a drip tray , a sluice ,
and an overflow reservoir .
if water &apos;s involved , we &apos;re gonna have to ground the crap out of the thing .
it &apos;s hot in here . i think i &apos;ll just take off all my clothes .
oh , i &apos;ve got it .
what about if we replace
panels a , b and f and crossbar h with aircraft @-@ grade aluminum ?
right. then the entire thing is one heat sink .
you and sheldon go to the junkyard and pick up
6 square meters of scrap aluminum ?
raj and i will get the oxyacetylene torch .
meet back here in an hour ?
done .
