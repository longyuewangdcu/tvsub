Wow. Keep that look.
Come on, baby.
There you go, there you go. Yes, yes.
Look right into the lens. Right in the lens.
Yeah... Yeah, that's the way.
Come on, give it to me. Let me see it,
let me see it. Oh, there you go.
Yes, yes, yes.
You're beautiful, Alana.
Yeah, you know it.
You know it.
Yes! That's what I want!
Right here, right here. Yes! Yeah.
Yes! Love it, love it.
There it is. We got it!
I'd give three to one, the cover's in that sequence.
Amy!
Ladies, can we try some new looks?
Okay, everybody,
back to the changing tent please?
Uh, new wardrobe, and back in ten.
These setups are taking way too long.
You're not getting tired, are you?
I'm fine.
Sure about that?
I am on the beach in Hawaii with the man I love.
I'm way more than okay.
So, baby, I've been thinking that maybe
we stayed here a couple more days.
We fly your family in and we get married.
What do you think? Right here.
Are you serious?
Well, what are we waiting for?
Right?
You make me so happy.
Go get changed.
We'll talk details tonight, okay?
I love you.
You okay?
Just peachy.
Hello?
Who's that out there?
Help me!
Help me! Somebody!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Renny!
Help me!
Let me go! Let me go!
Ho, Keikis! Be careful!
Hey, Kono, can I ask you something?
Sure.
Were you bummed when Jenny Shaun beat you in the finals
for the Junior Nationals?
Ho, little one, you cut to the bone, huh?
Yeah, I was pretty bummed.
But then you came back and beat her at the U.S. Open.
Now, that was fun.
Suzie! Come on!
I got to go.
Good job.
How long have you known Suzie?
Five years.
They diagnosed her with cystic fibrosis
when she was six months old.
And now she's surfing.
And being in the saltwater mist, where she can breathe better,
is the best medicine for her.
Yeah.
Thanks for helping out with my charity, Kono.
Thanks for inviting me.
I can't think of a better way to spend my day off.
You gotta go?
Sorry.
Hey, remind Suzie to practice
her pop-up in the hotel room.
You got it.
Thanks.
Cheers, Kawika.
Hey, Kono.
Hey.
All right, so our vic's name is Renny Sinclair.
He's a big-time photographer.
He's was in Oahu for three days shooting a swimsuit spread.
According to witnesses, Renny was inside his trailer
when it caught fire, and then exploded.
I'm thinking incendiary device.
Why do you think it was murder and not an accident?
Oh, well, if you'll follow me here, to Exhibit "A..."
we have a 13 mill steel shackle lock.
The firemen had to cut the door handle off to get it open.
Once someone slapped that on,
Renny never stood a chance of getting out.
You guys got to see this.
This might be where our killer's inspiration came from.
"Worship me"?
What is this, life imitating art?
Let me tell you something,
Anybody who burns somebody alive,
and makes him suffer the way he suffered...
this was personal.
Okay, Kono, stick with the crime techs
and finish processing the scene.
Chin. You, me and Danny
are going to go talk to some witnesses.
We'll start with Renny's closest associates first.
I'm going to talk to these models.
Okay, just stay with questions that relate to the case, all right?
What is that supposed to mean?
What it means is I know you.
I'm just saying stick to the case.
Hey. Hey. They're just women.
Who happen to be insanely hot and make millions of dollars.
I didn't know either of those things.
You are so busted.
Are you kidding me?
Go!
Go! Get off of me!
Leave him alone! You shouldn't even be here! Whoa!
Get off!
Go!
She did it. She killed him.
He didn't love her anymore, so she killed him.
You are an insane person. Stay away from me.
Stay away from me.
What do you got there?
I wanted her to see what she did.
She didn't just take Renny away from me,
she took him away from his child.
All right, just a moment.
Danny, come here. You come with me.
Come on. You all right?
She's insane.
What makes you think Jordan killed Renny?
She was, uh...
She was jealous of Renny and me.
Do you still love Renny?
What does that have to do with anything?
Well, it's relevant. I mean you guys were a couple, right?
Six months ago.
Okay, well, he and Alana were about to have a baby.
They were going to get married.
Obviously it kills any chance
of reconciliation for you guys, right?
I was over Renny.
Jordan wasn't over him.
After Renny broke up with her, she totally lost it.
Fell apart. I mean,
I don't think she ever really recovered.
After we broke up,
I wished him well, and I never looked back.
If he wanted to be with Alana,
I wasn't going to stand in the way of that.
She couldn't stand seeing us together.
Seeing us happy.
Why would I have taken this job if I wasn't over him?
If I was to turn down every job
because of past relationships with photographers,
I wouldn't have a career in this industry.
I know this may sound corny,
but Renny was everything to me.
I don't know where I go from here.
You go home,
you grieve, you get strong.
Everyone knew Jordan still had a thing for Renny,
but she was a complete pro during the shoot.
Where was she before the fire started?
Uh, she was supposed to be in the changing tent,
but I was running around getting ready for the next set up,
so I can't tell you for sure.
What about the other models? How'd they get along with Renny?
From what I can tell, everyone loved Renny.
How long have you been working with him?
Um, tomorrow will be a week.
I was a local hire.
To be honest,
I don't even know most of these people's names.
Was there anyone on set today who wasn't here working?
Any visitors? Anyone hanging around
the trailer who wasn't supposed to be?
There was this guy.
He drove a silver Porsche.
I only remember because Renny told me
to make sure he was allowed to drive on
and park next to his trailer.
Did you get a name or a license plate number?
I was just told to look out
for a friend of his driving a silver Porsche.
I waved him on the set and that was it.
I never even saw what he looked like.
Excuse me.
Uh, Charlie Fong?
I'm Officer...
Kono. How are you?
I'm... good.
That's great. It's really good to see you again.
I'm sorry. Do I...?
Do we know each other?
I knew you wouldn't remember.
Okay.
Let's get started.
I pulled the data that you sent over
from the Renny Sinclair crime scene
and put together a little reenactment.
Here we have the two gas cans
that you collected as evidence.
One was placed on the exterior,
underneath your victim's trailer,
and the other was placed on the interior,
under the bathroom sink.
We never worked a case together.
No, we haven't.
As I was saying-- once the exterior frame caught fire,
the flames set off this second gas can,
immediately engulfing the interior of the trailer.
All right. Were you able to analyze
the gas sample we recovered?
I'm running it through GCMS now.
If it's a viable sample, it'll tell us
what station this gas was purchased at.
Very cool.
Yeah. It's amazing.
Chemically speaking.
All right, so what else do we know?
Found something inside your melted gas can.
What is all that?
Can't see what it is from the X-ray,
so I'm having one of the other techs
take it to an industrial oven.
The only way to extract it
is to carefully melt away the plastic.
Did you graduate from Kukui High?
Nope. Punahou.
You're not going to make this easy, are you?
Just the crime solving stuff.
Yeah. Yeah,
I got it. 3:00.
I'll be there.
Yeah.
What's going on?
That was I.A.
They want to see me this afternoon at 3:00.
Your uncle talked to them, didn't he?
He told them it wasn't me.
And he told them my auntie
was dying and needed a new kidney,
so he stole the $200,000 out of the asset forfeiture locker
to save her life. And now, of course,
I.A. officially reopens the case.
Look, Chin, listen, this is going to clear your name.
Yeah, it will.
But at what cost?
My uncle was a righteous cop, Steve.
In his 25 years, he put away hundreds of criminals--
guys that deserved to be off the street.
And if he's found guilty, they'll enact judicial review.
All of his past convictions can be called into question.
Guilty men will walk straight out of prison.
So let me call the governor.
No.
It's my problem.
I'll handle it.
What's with him?
His uncle's about to be arrested.
What did he do? He told the truth?
Yeah.
Chin's been carrying this secret for so long,
he'd rather keep living with it than see his uncle go to jail.
Where have you been anyway?
Well, I have been doing my job.
Okay, I thoroughly questioned all the models
on Renny's photo shoot this morning.
I bet you did.
Get your mind out of the gutter, okay?
I was strictly business.
Okay, turns out
all the ladies say the same thing--
Jordan and Alana were both
in the changing tent at the time of the fire.
So Jordan didn't do it?
What'd I just say?
I mean, unless she can teleport her body, no,
she didn't do it.
So we got no suspects on this?
Hold on. Relax. Okay?
I had HPD run Renny's financials and his phone records.
Look at this. Guy's like a 15-year-old girl.
All text messages, no phone calls.
Why is a fashion photographer sending coded texts?
All right. You know what?
I'm going to send this to Catherine.
She can have the, uh, the boys in Intel
run it through...
What? It's not coded texts.
Okay? No need for your little Ramboette.
Okay, this is not your, uh, cloak-and-dagger spook speak.
This is Danny's world. Oh?
These are bets.
Bets?
What are you talking about, bets?
Yeah.
Guy had action all over the place.
BOS minus eight-- that's Boston Celtics, minus eight points.
NYK, 2.5-- that's the Knicks
minus two and a half points.
Check you out.
Guy was an animal.
Bets all over the place.
What else you got?
I'll show you. Look at this.
Guy's got open credit markers all over Vegas.
Mandalay, Caesars, Bellagio.
Look at the bank records.
Every dollar that comes in goes straight back out again.
He's a cash poor kind of guy.
Yeah, strapped for cash, but he's still banking bets, right?
So, if he can't come up with the dough, what does that mean?
It means he's burning his bookie.
Yeah, then maybe the bookie did the same thing to him.
Chin.
I knew you'd be here.
Why is that?
'Cause of all the fishing spots you know,
you never once caught anything here worth keeping.
I figured you're here more to think than to fish.
You shouldn't have come here.
Since I.A. opened this investigation,
you're in violation
of a department mandate if you have contact with me.
Uncle, I.A. called me.
I have to appear before a review board this afternoon.
That's good.
Tell them the truth.
The truth doesn't matter anymore.
What matters now is keeping you out of jail.
You don't have to be silent any longer, Chin.
You owe me nothing.
I owe you everything.
I need you to go back to I.A.
and tell them that since auntie died,
you haven't been thinking clearly.
Chin...
That you didn't know what you were saying.
I need you to go back
and tell them that I took the money.
I'm not telling them that.
Telling them that could put you in jail.
I'm not lying anymore.
GCMS findings
are back on the gas our killer used to start the fire.
He bought 87 octane.
That doesn't help us.
87 is the most widely used octane of gas,
but the additives are a match to a local chain--
Lex Brodie's Gas.
How many stations are there on the Island?
Twelve.
So all we have to do is match this gas sediment fingerprint
to a specific Lex Brodie Station,
and we know where our killer bought the gas.
Exactly.
What are you so happy about?
We now have to collect samples from 12 different stations.
That's cool. I need gas anyway.
Cool tech.
You're not the only nerd on the block.
Let's roll.
I think I just found that mystery guest
who paid a visit to our vic this morning.
Witness I spoke to said he was driving a silver Porsche,
right?
Right.
I pulled this off a traffic cam near the crime scene.
Time code places it on the road right around T.O.D.
Perfect. You run the plates?
Comes right back to a shell corporation.
It's just the kind of move you'd expect from...
Derek Marcum.
You know him?
Yeah.
I busted him years back when he was small-time.
Now he's major league.
Actually, he runs most of the betting action on the Island.
Oh, he's a bookie, huh?
Mm-hmm. I wonder if Marcum was taking bets from our vic.
Oh, we have evidence that says Renny had a gambling problem.
How do we find this guy?
You don't.
From what I hear, he's by referral only.
Okay, we just have to find somebody
who can give us an introduction.
Okay, so, all the bets
were texted to Marcum's prepaid cell.
I took the numbers and made a client list.
Okay, good. We just get one of Marcum's clients to give him up.
Yeah, I got the perfect guy. Real whale.
Oh, yeah, a high stakes gambler?
No, he's literally a whale.
I'm paying you for your energy
and your passion.
Come on!
You got to feel the shave ice,
you got to be the shave ice.
Come on, supersize that thing.
Come on!
It's 120 in here, and I'm gonna pass out.
You like pass out before or after I pay you?
Hey.
Hey, my haole brothers from another mother.
How you doing?
Howzit?
What's with the muppet?
That's an economic stimulator.
Brah, this is Hawaii.
Shave ice everywhere.
Saturated market.
It's all about distinguishing your product,
maximizing your brand awareness.
Well, if you wanted more cash,
maybe you shouldn't have taken Northwestern last week.
Oh, me? No. I don't gamble for money, bro.
I'm afraid that's not true.
We know you have an open account with Marcum.
No, no, no, never. Never do that.
Oh, I believe you.
Look, this is what I'm gonna do.
I got this number off of Marcum's phone records.
I'm gonna call it right now,
and, uh, I don't know,
we'll see whose phone rings.
You gonna get that?
Grandma.
Hi, dear.
Okay, look,
I don't do this a lot,
and I'm only down a little.
No, no, you're not down a little.
You have not won a bet in six months.
Okay, you are the worst gambler of all time.
I tried. That's all I can do.
Kamekona, listen, we need to find Marcum, okay?
That's a tough bugger to find.
Okay, well, that-that bugger
is a suspect in a murder investigation.
And I never seen him.
Okay, but you owe him money, right?
So does everybody else who gambles.
Okay, fine.
That's why you're gonna call his people.
You're gonna tell them that you're not gonna pay
any of the money back, not a cent,
and if they got a problem with that, they know where you work.
No, I can't do that. I got to pay 'em.
You don't understand.
These are big, scary guys.
Big scary guys, huh?
This is Kame.
Uh, yeah, I forgot.
Three, two, four, four.
Yeah.
If you want the money that I owe you,
you're going to have to come here
and take it from me,
because I am not paying.
That's it. Lesson learned.
If I live through this, I'm never gambling again.
Yeah, right.
How much you like to bet?
All right, last one.
Let's go.
Hey, boss.
Hey, Kono, you finish collecting
those gas samples yet?
Yeah. We just got the last one.
We're heading back to the lab now to see if we can land a match.
Okay, fine. Listen, we think
we may have a suspect that we want to move on, okay,
but we're gonna need some evidence first.
So, let me know when you get something.
Copy that.
No pressure.
Why don't you put on some tunes.
That always dials down the pressure.
Yeah. That's a good idea.
Looking for your Boyz II Men?
I haven't listened to them since I was ten years old.
"On Bended Knee" was your favorite.
Camp Waimea.
That's where I knew you from.
Keep trying.
So, Kamekona,
what's this about you not wanting to pay Marcum?
You play dumb?
Answer me.
You like getting lickins?
I'm sorry.
I just overheard-- did you say "lickings"?
You know how difficult it is to sound
like a tough guy when you use a word like "lickings"?
You should try "Beatings." Like, "I'm gonna give you a beating."
It works, trust me, on a lot of different levels.
Five-O, guys.
Let's go take a seat,
keep your hands where we can see 'em.
Let's have a little chat about what's going on.
Cool. All right.
Danny.
I got him.
Let me ask you a question:
what part of "Sit down and chat" did you not understand, huh?
Open the door.
Stay there, stay there.
All right, come on.
Go through. Go.
Let's go, everybody up. Up, up, up, up, up right now.
Into the office.
Let's go, huddle, huddle, huddle.
All right,
nice, huddle up the back there,
keep each other warm with your bodies,
take a seat on the floor.
Very good.
Now, take a seat.
Derek Marcum,
keep your hands where I can see them.
That way everybody gets to go home
at the end of the day, all right?
Gentlemen, I take it you're part
of Honolulu's law enforcement community.
What, uh...
what gave us away?
You're wearing a tie in Hawaii.
Do us a favor, take a seat.
I want to ask you a couple questions.
So what's this about?
This is about Renny Sinclair.
We have you on camera leaving a photo shoot
right after Renny was killed.
Renny's dead? What happened?
Well, what I think happened
is that he owes you a gambling debt
and you couldn't come up with the dough, so you killed him.
I didn't kill him.
Renny was a friend.
I don't use that word lightly.
Okay, all right, but just so I understand,
he did owe you money, right, and you obviously wanted it.
Hypothetically speaking,
if I were involved in illegal bookmaking,
I wouldn't kill a client.
Dead clients tend to have trouble clearing debts.
He's got a point.
That being said, in this hypothetical situation,
no, Renny did not owe me a gambling debt.
Okay, so what were you doing at the photo shoot?
I'm in a cash business, gentlemen.
Sometimes that leaves me with a reserve.
From time to time I lend that reserve out for a profit.
Renny came to me,
he asked to borrow some money, I gave it to him.
How much?
$291,570.
That's a very specific amount.
Did he tell you what it was for?
You know, banks ask those kind
of questions of their clients; I don't.
What's that?
That's how he was going to repay me.
He signed over the first 400 large of his book's profits to me.
Renny mints cash with these things.
Okay.
If this contract is legit...
...then that helps your cause.
But if it's not, that proves to us that you did not want
Renny alive to dispute your claims.
In the meantime, let me see your hands.
We're changing venues.
For what, gambling,
lending money?
You do realize I'm gonna post bail
and be out in a few hours?
Yeah, that's true, but it'll give us a little time to decide
if we're going to extend your stay for murder.
Hey, don't tell anyone,
but I think I might have become a Town girl.
You know those south swells at bowls?
You ever paddled out there?
You don't know me from surfing.
Nice try, though.
Bingo.
The gas your killer used to torch your vic
was purchased on Miahi Avenue
near Kukapu.
Nice.
So hopefully our killer used a credit card
so we can pull those receipts
and cross-reference with any suspects.
Hey, hey, we'll need to run this
through handwriting analysis,
okay, verify that Renny actually signed it.
All right, we also have to make sure
that he didn't sign it under duress.
And there's the $291,570--
a very specific amount of dough,
obviously for something very specific.
Know what? I'll have HPD
forensic accountants dig deeper into his financials,
see if they can find that exact amount anywhere.
All right?
Look, I'm gonna tell I.A. That I took the money.
If you're calling to talk me out of it, don't bother.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm calling to say good luck, okay?
Mahalo.
Against my better judgment, Officer Kelly,
this board will entertain your statement
with regards to the missing money
from the asset forfeiture locker.
Chairman Akahoshi...
my uncle was devastated by the death of my aunt,
and in a misguided attempt
to help me salvage my career with HPD,
he tried to implicate himself.
But the truth is...
...I took the money.
Let me understand this.
You were accused of stealing this money--
an accusation which you denied and fought
to the point of resigning from HPD...
That's correct.
And yet now,
after your uncle comes forward,
you're telling us you took the money?
Yes, sir, that's correct.
He was lying
to protect me.
How do we know you're not lying to protect him?
And how would you explain the fact
that after years of monitoring your finances,
we've turned up absolutely nothing--
no large transactions, no new accounts,
no sign of that money anywhere.
That's because I never spent it.
You met with I.A., didn't you?
I told them I took the money.
Did they believe you?
Not right away.
They said they'd been tracking my spending habits for years.
So I told them I didn't spend any of it.
They then ordered me to produce all the money
by the end of the day tomorrow.
Chin, you don't have that kind of money.
I know.
No one in our family does,
and you can't go to the bank 'cause they'll know.
So where are you going to get it from?
You need to go back there and tell 'em you lied.
Just end this.
It's done.
I'm not going back.
Now you should answer that.
Thank you.
Okay, that was the handwriting analyst,
who just confirmed that Renny did sign the contract
turning the proceeds of the book over to Marcum.
No markers indicate that it was signed under duress.
Okay, well, that's definitely going to come
as a shock to Marcum.
Uh, I just got off the phone
with Renny's attorney in New York.
Apparently his will supersedes
any other arrangements he might have made.
Okay, who's, uh, who's the heir to his estate?
That's where it gets interesting.
Most of Renny's assets are to be put into a trust,
all going to a woman named Pauline Lucero.
Who is Pauline Lucero?
I have no idea; we're running background right now.
She stood to make a lot of money from Renny's death.
She's got motive.
We'll talk about it later.
You know that unknown item we found melted in the gas can?
Yeah.
The lab managed to get it out.
A lighter.
Not just any lighter. It's an Aeros.
These things go for thousands of dollars.
And our killer used it to light the fire that killed Renny.
The butane inside heated up and blew it to pieces.
What do you got?
I thought that looked familiar.
That's Renny's fiancee.
Alana.
Yeah,
and it's not just the lighter she's holding.
It's our murder weapon.
Hey. Can I take a seat?
How you feeling?
As good as I can, I guess.
What can you tell me about this picture?
We shot that in L.A.
Renny insisted the cake be purple.
They must have brought five cakes
that weren't purple enough.
Where'd you find this?
We have reason to believe that the lighter you're holding
in this picture was the lighter that was used
to start the fire that killed Renny.
That was Renny's lighter.
The-the client gave it to him as a gift
at the end of the shoot.
When was the last time you saw it?
Yesterday...
in-in Renny's trailer.
Okay. Could he have, uh,
could he have loaned it to anybody?
That lighter was worth a lot of money, and Renny cherished it.
I... I don't think he would have given it to anyone.
But there were a lot of people on that beach yesterday,
so anyone could have stolen it from his trailer.
All right.
Listen, have you ever heard of a woman
named Pauline Lucero?
No. Why?
According to Renny's lawyers,
he had just set up a trust for her.
A trust?
Why would he do that?
I don't know.
I mean, I... I know a Shannon Lucero.
She was one of the first real supermodels.
I used to...
I used to have a picture of her
up in my room when I was a little girl.
Did Renny know her?
Yeah.
They, uh, they dated in the early '90s.
I... asked him about it once.
He said it ended badly, 'cause she...
she wanted to get married and... and have kids,
and he had just started his career,
and he wasn't ready.
Couple of years ago he heard she had moved to Milan.
But they...they never really spoke after the breakup.
Excuse me a sec.
Yeah.
Chin.
HPD forensic accountants took a look at the amount of money
that Renny borrowed from Marcum, and get this--
their research turned up that $291,570
is the exact amount that the U.S. Department of Agriculture
reports that it costs to raise a child to the age of 18.
All right, listen, I think Renny and another model
named Shannon Lucero had a daughter named Pauline, okay?
Run Shannon Lucero through Interpol
and the Italian Embassy.
Have Kono cross-reference the name Lucero
against any receipts from the gas station
we know the killer went to.
You got it.
How long have you been working with him?
Um, tomorrow will be a week.
I was a local hire.
Okay, I just got a hit on those gas station receipts.
Our mystery woman, Pauline Lucero,
she purchased the gas the day Renny was murdered.
She's not a mystery woman anymore.
Say hello to Amy, the production assistant.
AKA Pauline Lucero.
She's Renny's daughter.
And our killer.
Amy, we need to talk to you.
Amy.
It's over. Come on.
You know what? Wait a minute.
Pauline, I got to ask you something.
How could you kill your father?
He wasn't my father.
Yes, he was your father.
No.
He left when my mom was pregnant.
He never even knew me.
And when my mother got sick,
he turned his back on her.
I tried to contact him...
but he wouldn't even take my calls.
Okay, I'm sorry,
so... so you killed him?
I had just buried my mother,
and he didn't want to have anything to do with me.
All right, so you get a job on his photo shoot
so you can get close enough to him
to burn him alive.
He wanted to be worshipped.
Well, now he can be.
Well, um, just so you know,
uh, we did some investigating, and it seems that your father...
he had a change of heart
when he found out that Alana was pregnant.
He wanted you in his life, Pauline.
You're lying.
He set up a trust in your name.
Started it with the exact amount of money
he should've spent raising you.
What? Yeah, there's a private detective
in Italy right now that he hired looking for you.
Mind your head when you're getting in the car.
Hey, Kelly! Oh, my gosh!
I'm glad you made it.
I wouldn't miss it, darling.
I even dragged my cousin down to help.
Fong?
Hey, Kono.
I heard you two lovebirds finally worked a case together.
Oh-whoa, lovebirds?
Kelly, come on.
Wait. You don't remember?
No, I've been trying, but...
Kelly.
My tenth birthday.
My parents let me throw a coed party,
and while they were upstairs,
we played spin the bottle.
Oh, my God.
That's what it is!
Oh! Wait, did we?
You were the first girl I kissed.
Oh! Now I totally remember.
I'm sorry, my braces cut your lip.
I'm-I'm a big dork.
Well, I don't remember my lip getting cut.
But I remember you were a pretty good kisser.
Still am.
Interesting.
Kawika.
Are you a surfer?
Uh, no, no, I'm a cop.
That looks like a surfer's haircut.
This does? No, I can assure you this is not a surfer's haircut.
Danno don't even swim.
You gonna start with me now?
I'm still taking surfing lessons, so you know.
And the word on the street is that I shred.
I hear Jersey's pretty good.
I'm sure he's something.
Can we go back out, Kawika?
Shoots.
Hey, where's Chin?
I don't know, he said he had to do something before he came.
Five-O, look, I answered all your partner's questions,
I paid my bail-- I'm done talking about Renny.
I'm not here about that.
Okay. I'm listening.
What use would I have for the deed to your home?
I need $200,000.
