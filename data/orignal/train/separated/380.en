Over 68 million Americans
leave the safety of our borders every year.
If danger strikes,
the FBI's International Response Team
is called into action.
Hey! Please! Please! Let me show you!
This is 200.
Oh! Honey.
Isn't this marvelous?
For you, friends, special price, 300 Dirham.
300? I'll give you 50.
250. Sir, this is one-of-a-kind.
Okay, okay.
200, but that is as low as I can go.
I will go hungry.
I know we said no souvenirs, but --
$20.
Isn't it beautiful?
Yes. Yes, very beautiful.
You should listen to the lady. Very smart woman.
Sir, you're a lucky man.
Yes, I am. 75.
Go with it. It's part of the bit.
Ah, sir. You're twisting my arm.
Okay. Uh, 125.
No, thanks.
This isn't the good stuff, anyway.
My friend, my friend. You are a wise man.
This cheap. It's for tourists.
You want to see real Moroccan khimar?
Come.
What'd I tell you?
This way.
Here, for you!
Okay, people. Time to head back to the ship.
No, no!
Help!
No!
Help!
Gentlemen. Please be reasonable.
Now, we can find terms amenable to both sides.
But first, I need you both agree to a temporary détente.
They're children, Matt. Use words they can understand.
He started it!
He said Baron Von Spacewarp
could kick Captain Freedom's b-u-t.
Baron Spacewarp is the most awesomest
space marshal in the universe!
Is not!
Is so!
Uh, FBI train you for this?
Guys. The record is pretty clear.
Spacewarp is the most imposing lawman of 2114.
See?
But Captain Freedom is awesome right now.
And I know that because I work for him.
You know what Captain Freedom would say
in a situation like this?
No.
What?
Well, he would say --
Good morning, Simmons.
Hey, cap.
We caught another case.
Kidnapping in Morocco.
Yeah.
Be right there.
Evening, everyone.
Hi, Jack.
Hey, Jack.
This afternoon, Peter and Kate Carson
of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho
were abducted in Casablanca, Morocco,
while they were visiting on a cruise.
Six hours later, the family received ransom demands --
$400,000 U.S.
Or the kidnappers say they'll kill the hostages.
Method of contact?
Proof of life was photographic,
sent via anonymous e-mail.
Ransom demand came by way of phone call
to the victims' families.
Now, the call was routed through a darknet V.O.I.P. relay.
By darknet, you mean --
Tor routed. Untraceable.
That's what I was afraid of.
They demanded the ransom be paid in bitcoin.
This ain't these guys' first dance.
Doesn't look like it.
Seems like we're dealing with experienced kidnappers.
The family was instructed not to contact authorities.
Naturally, their first call was to us.
The man on the phone said he'd call back in eight hours.
Monty's gonna intercept the call and re-route it to the jet.
What do we have on similar incidents in the area?
There have been somewhere between 90 and 100 abductions
in Morocco in the last decade,
Most in the southern desert regions.
Most are local clans involved in petty land skirmishes.
It's very rare to involve tourists,
and never Americans until now.
Reports in the area are still filed by hand,
so interpol said it would take a while to scan and send.
Let us know what you find.
This says that the Carsons were taken from a crowded market
without attracting any attention.
Well, grabbing two people would require a team, multiple unsubs.
Yes, but in my experience,
any more than three or four
would be too many to effectively coordinate.
Yeah, but there's got to be a leader,
somebody calling the shots.
And a point man -- someone who could lure the Carsons
without raising suspicions.
Has to be around a lot of people.
And left a trace.
That's where we start --
The spotter.
Peter. Who are those men?
I don't know.
This -- this blindfold --
Oh, God.
What? What is it?
It's him.
Hello.
Hello?
The family was told not to contact anyone.
They didn't. The cruise line did.
To whom am I speaking?
He's educated.
This is Jack Garrett of the FBI.
So... do you have my money?
I'm working on it.
So what do I call you? What's your name?
You can call me Ben.
Ben. What's the significance?
Well, listen to me, Ben.
We both want the same thing here --
For you to get paid and for the Carsons
to be returned safely to their family.
Are you a father, Ben?
Not a father.
He's unwilling to give up any unnecessary information.
I need to speak with the Carsons.
I need to know they're okay.
Where is my money?
It's coming.
You've done this before. You know it's gonna take time.
But for right now, I need to speak with Peter and Kate.
No.
You get me my money, Jack Garrett of the FBI.
You have 72 hours or the Carsons die.
第一季 第七集
"You are the bows from which your children
as living arrows are sent forth."
Kahlil Gibran.
68 hours.
The clock's ticking.
We ready?
Simmons, head to the abduction site.
See what the kidnappers left behind.
Salah Sabila of the Casablanca P.D. will meet you there.
On it.
Mae, you and Clara head to the ship.
Start a victimology from the Carsons' state room
and the other people on that tour.
Where you headed, Jack?
You're not the only one
who has to deal with children.
No, sir. According to international law,
this ship is subject only to the laws
of the country under whose flag she flies.
Not while you're in port.
Here, I am the rule of law.
If you think I'm letting you
or any of your thugs onboard this -- - Thugs?
You heard me. The crime happened in your square.
Why won't you let my men come into town and investigate?
Because you are visitors.
And you're incompetent.
Gentlemen.
Unit Chief Jack Garrett of the FBI.
The first thing for both of you to remember
is that we're here to get Peter and Kate Carson back alive.
My team has been in touch with the kidnappers.
Their P.O.C. is a man who calls himself Ben.
We want to focus our efforts on locating him.
What do you have?
Nothing.
Great.
Chief Inspector Rains,
Considering the victims are Americans,
would you mind if the FBI ran point on this?
No. That would be fine.
Good. Mr. Veidt,
While you may be head of security
while the ship's at sea,
on land, we're all subject to the laws and conventions of the Kingdom of Morocco.
Please order your men to stay on the ship.
Yes, sir.
We'd like to interview some of the crew.
Great. Let's go to work.
Agent Montgomery, my dad taught sixth grade for 40 years.
I mean, my mom was a social worker.
They built habitat houses in the summer.
There's no way we can come up with $400,000.
I'm not asking you to.
I just have to let you know that the rules have changed.
The FBI would be allowed to help facilitate any ransom exchange
if you had the money - and if that were your choice.
My parents had to scrimp and save to go on this trip.
It was supposed to be my dad's retirement celebration.
I just -- I don't understand.
Why would anyone want to kidnap them?
We're still trying to figure that out.
So this is how it works?
You save your entire life and then you get kidnapped?
Stay strong, Grace.
Agent Garrett and his team will do everything in their power
to bring your parents home safe.
Did you hear that?
I think they said FBI.
Shh! I'm trying to listen.
Oh, my god.
He's just a child.
Water.
Please.
He speaks English.
What's your name?
Please.
We don't have much, but we'll give you whatever we can.
Just let us go.
Please.
Come back!
Right over there.
I am Sabila.
SSA Matt Simmons, FBI.
Oh, yes. We've been expecting you.
Suspect?
He is a nobody.
We're just trying to put a little scare into the locals.
This market is a -- how do you say --
a wretched hive of scum and villainy?
So, do we have a crime scene?
Not really.
The souk sets up every morning, tears down every night.
The carts change places every day,
so there's not much left in terms of physical evidence.
Well, I can see at least a dozen potential points of egress.
14, by my count.
So the kidnappers could have come and gone from anywhere.
It's a lot busier than I remember.
The market has undergone a revival in recent years.
Nowadays, people travel from thousands of miles
to sell their wares in the Casablanca Bazaar.
So, between the vendors and the customers,
any given day you're getting, what,
a couple thousand people coming through here?
Anybody see anything?
You didn't ask.
Cause you're too busy harassing the locals.
We were getting around to it.
Mm-hmm. Let me help you with that.
Yeah, we'll start with the merchants.
Thank you.
Okay.
Interior stateroom.
Save on the tickets.
Budget luggage.
Tips for cheap travel.
Some leftovers from the ship's buffet.
So if organized, methodical kidnappers target their victims,
why would they choose a couple
who so clearly don't have any money?
Oh ho ho. What's with the bling, Mr. Carson?
Can't afford a room with a view,
but you can afford a $6,000 watch.
It was a gift.
When dad announced his retirement,
the whole community got together
and created a scholarship fund in his name.
And they gave him the watch as a thank-you
for 40 years of service.
People must have really liked your dad.
You know how everyone has that one teacher
that really believed in them, changed their lives?
Mr. Eastman. A.P. Calculus.
My father was that to so many people.
He was so proud of that watch.
He wore it everywhere.
You don't really think that's what got them kidnapped?
We don't know.
But at this point, it does fill in some blanks.
Why would I know them?
Cause several people are saying
they saw you bartering with them yesterday.
I see hundreds of people here a day.
I'm supposed to remember them all?
There were suggestions
that you may have shown them into the back room.
You have something to hide, Hassan?
No. Nothing.
My friend, you like? I can make you a deal.
I can -- I can make you an offer.
See, Hassan, this type of behavior --
this suggests to us something we call
"Avoidance and transference."
It's what makes me think you're lying.
Of course he's lying. Look at him.
If you hadn't seen the Carsons,
why didn't you just tell us?
I did! I did!
No, you didn't. No, you didn't.
When I asked if you'd seen them,
you asked me why would you have.
Then when I ask you a follow-up,
you make it about pretty much anything
except for the question I asked you.
You want me to beat him a little?
No, no.
Thanks.
Hassan.
Are you gonna tell me what happened
between you and the Carsons?
That's perfectly all right.
You can't remember what you didn't see.
Thanks for your time.
No problem.
Next.
Please. I-it wasn't my idea.
It was the merchant's.
You know, we could have saved time
if we had done this from the start.
Where are the Carsons, Hassan?
I showed them some clothing.
They went on their way. I swear it!
Everybody saw them come in. Nobody saw them go out.
Where are they?
No, they went out through the back.
You see? They left.
The last I saw, they were talking to another man.
Describe him.
The vendor said he was a clean-cut man
in his 20s or 30s, wearing western clothing.
Body language and linguistics
make me think he was telling the truth,
but he was holding something back.
I don't know what.
I do.
He and some of the other shop owners
were running a kickback scheme
with one of the tour guides from the boat.
The guide would steer inexperienced travelers
towards specific shopkeepers in the souk
who would overcharge for cheap souvenirs.
Then they'd send a portion of the profits
back to the tour guide as a finder's fee.
It's too basic a scam to be our unsubs,
but they may have been watching, using it to identify targets.
It's a good start.
Guys, I got something, and you're not gonna like it.
Interpol found three other kidnappings
over the last five years with the same M.O. as the Carsons'.
Couples grabbed off cruise ships.
Same anonymous e-mail server, same bitcoin address.
None of the victims were American,
or else we would have heard of them.
These aren't even in Morocco.
These cases are in Algeria,
Tunisia, and Libya.
And it gets worse.
In each of these cases, whether the ransom was paid or not,
all the victims were killed by a single gunshot to the head.
These aren't simple kidnappers.
They're serial killers.
And we've got 51 hours to find them.
Jack, things have changed.
I want my money in 24 hours
or I start sending body parts.
16 hours.
Why shorten the timeline now
and not in any of the previous cases?
Look.
Every time that they take someone,
the ransom goes up --
$50,000, $75,000,
$200,000, and now $400,000.
So, they're either getting bolder
or they're getting more desperate.
Moving the deadline makes me think it's the latter.
They're not just greedy. They need money.
For what?
Drugs? Guns? Debts?
So, what do we know about them?
They're not emotional.
Gunshot wound to the head is -- is dispassionate.
If it was a single actor, I'd say they were unbalanced,
but groups tend to keep one another in check.
For five years?
It's a long time for people like this to stay together.
So they're tight-knit, loyal.
Could they be family?
I mean Ben means "Son" in Arabic.
Family or not, they're mobile.
It's 1,200 miles from the first abduction site to here.
Why go all that way for a snatch-and-grab?
You know, at the market, Salah,
he said that people travel thousands of miles
to sell their goods at the Casablanca Bazaar.
Now, I thought he was exaggerating, but --
But North Africa is home to some of the world's
most wide-ranging nomadic merchant populations.
You mean like Gypsies.
That'd be a great way for the unsubs to hide.
Monty, find resources that track
the migratory patterns of North African merchants.
We're looking for a group that may have been in the area
during each of the three prior kidnappings.
You understand.
What are they saying?
His hands are rough like worker.
I-I build houses in the summer.
Rich people build houses in your country?
I told you. We're not rich.
I really appreciate it. Mm-hmm.
I can do that.
I understand.
Thank you.
Good news?
Yes.
The bank agreed to give me an emergency loan against my house.
I can pay the ransom.
You have news. What is it?
It's not about your parents,
but we have identified three other kidnappings
by the same group.
In those cases, when the ransom was paid...
The victims turned up dead.
Now, Grace, we cannot presume anything.
We have every reason to believe your parents are alive,
but I need you to not pay the ransom
to give my team as much time as possible.
What?
Wait, first, you're telling me to get you the money,
and now you're saying we can't use it?
That's not what I said. I did not say to get the money.
You strongly implied it!
You said you would facilitate the payment.
Those were your words.
You told me that we would pay the ransom and get them back.
That's what you said.
I understand that you're frustrated.
But circumstances have changed.
If you give them the money,
you'll make it very difficult for my team.
No. I'm not gonna just sit here
while some psychopath murders my parents.
I want to pay the ransom, and I want them back.
Look, I know you feel helpless.
I know that you're a person of action,
and right now, it feels like the only option
you have is to give them the money,
But I'm telling you from experience,
That is the wrong thing to do.
My team is the best in the world at this.
Please.
Let them do their job.
So, TripIt doesn't exactly have a wandering nomad registry,
but I think I found a link between the Carsons' abductions
and the three previous kidnappings.
During the three prior kidnappings,
the same tribe of tuareg merchants was in the area.
the Tuaregs --
As in the "Wandering blue men of the Sahara"?
The very same.
Now, according to the State Department,
who apparently tracks this kind of thing,
the tribe is attending
an annual gathering of Tuareg tribes
that happens to be in Casablanca right now.
The Tuaregs are nomadic merchants
who still roam the desert by camel
and set up camp wherever they go.
They're famous for their silversmithing
and their beautiful indigo clothing.
The blue dye they use -- it rubs off on their skin,
and over the years, they've come to be known by it.
You think you're gonna get Victor Laszlo,
and you end up getting "Lawrence of Arabia."
Yeah, the Tuaregs --
They still live like they did 1,000 years ago.
My God, look at this place.
400 grand would last a lifetime in a world like this.
Still, they have to be spending it on something.
Let's find out what.
So, you want that we should ransack it?
Let's try some diplomacy first.
See how far talking gets us.
It's up to you.
You think they're keeping the Carsons here?
I doubt it. This camp is wide open.
It'd be tough to get hostages in and out of here
without the entire tribe being in on it.
These are filthy people.
I would be surprised if they weren't.
This guy.
So... We're looking for a small group
that's educated and technological.
Yeah, you see a lot of places
with a high-speed internet connection around here?
Even if the kidnappers aren't here,
we know this is their group,
so somebody here knows who they are.
Just keep your men back.
Let's go make friends.
Alpha males everywhere we go.
Yeah, it's the way of the world.
Yeah, well, at least this time they're working to our benefit.
Yeah, if Jack can keep the boys busy.
You've come a long way, friend.
We appreciate your hospitality.
It's always my pleasure
to welcome new visitors to our camp.
I'm afraid I come with troubling news.
We believe some members of your flock may have strayed.
We think a group of men may have kidnapped some Americans.
Please.
Tell me of these men you seek so I can see if I can help.
We believe there are maybe three or four,
possibly a family, who are in dire need of money.
That could describe any family in this camp.
Certainly you don't mean to accuse my entire tribe.
Of course not. That wasn't my intention.
These men... have become deadly.
My men are deadly.
We think they're abducting men and women to kill them
and steal their family's wealth.
That, my men would not do.
Matrilineal?
Yeah.
In the Tuareg culture,
power is passed down the maternal lines.
Women are the property owners,
and the leadership is not passed from chieftain to son,
but to the eldest male child of his sister.
So daddy's in charge,
but mommy still pulls the strings.
Are we gonna scrap?
My neighborhood, you take off your earrings
and you're ready to throw down.
You are from Greenwich, Connecticut.
Yeah, well.
Welcome.
I was wondering if we could talk.
As you can see, we have everything we could need.
The Tuareg life is simple.
We desire not for the indulgence of this world.
What about computers or education?
We have no need.
Our young are taught what they need to know.
The children learn to read and write.
What if somebody wanted a more formal schooling?
We are an open people.
Some have been known to leave the camp
and pursue an education.
How do they pay for that?
We are not without some resources.
Families share.
Mr. Jack.
Your people tell us that we are poor,
and they tell us that money can bring hope.
Is it any surprise to you
that men would do terrible things in the name of hope?
So you do know who these men are.
Let us assume for a moment
that someone from my camp committed the crimes
of which you speak.
I can assure you they will be found
and they will be dealt with.
The Carsons don't have time to wait for tribal justice.
I mean no offense,
but would you mind if we look around your camp?
Of course I would mind.
You want justice. I find it admirable.
But you must understand that we, as travelers,
have been accused of many crimes we did not commit.
Jack, we are both leaders of men.
If I allow my camp to be searched at every accusation,
how long do you think that would remain true?
Not long, I'm sure.
Our Tinesmegelen have provided us with medicine for centuries.
Tinesmegelen?
Faith healers.
Well, this is more than faith.
Can you tell us about this?
I'm sorry. I have said what I can.
As predicted, the chieftain was cordial but uncooperative.
But he wanted us to know the men we're looking for
are part of this tribe.
He said men can do terrible things in the name of hope.
Modern medicine hope?
There was an empty cot in the medical tent.
Missing patient?
He's just a boy!
Do you feel powerful when you hit a child?
You're no man, you coward!
Peter! No.
Stop it! You're hurting him!
Please! Please! Don't!
Take him to the desert and kill him.
Show them we mean business.
No!
10 hours.
If we don't find the Carsons by the end of the day,
we'll be lucky to find them at all.
Okay, the piece we found at the camp
was a TG-135 precision I.V. control valve.
That's used to administer medication to patients
who have chronic conditions like cancer or kidney failure.
Long-term diseases that require expensive medical care.
If one of the kidnappers or a family member was sick,
that would explain why they need the money.
And if the disease is degenerative,
it would speak to the increasing urgency of the ransom demands.
You saw that camp. It was primitive.
Why would people who reject all forms
of modern life turn to this?
The matron said that some of the children
leave the tribe to go to school.
What if one of them came back,
thought they could save the life of a family member?
That would explain where the unsubs learned to use technology.
Monty, see if you can find hospital records
for any members of that tribe
who are receiving ongoing treatment
for some type of degenerative condition.
You got a surname?
The Sahara is the largest desert on earth.
Well, let's concentrate on the ports
where the previous kidnappings occurred.
And do it fast. We only have till the end of the day.
Or not.
Peter Carson's just turned up at a hospital in town.
He's in bad shape.
Is he alive?
I want to talk to him.
He's in surgery now.
His injuries were pretty extensive,
but the doctor says he's gonna be okay.
Where's my mother?
We don't know.
The kidnappers may still have her.
That's it. We're paying.
Grace.
No.
Your people had their chance.
I'm not gonna just sit here
and wait for my mom to turn up dead.
Thank you.
Hey, Jack. We got a problem.
Family's gonna pay the ransom,
so if Kate didn't escape with Peter --
Peter didn't escape.
He arrived here with a femur broken in three places.
The only way that Peter got to this hospital
was if someone else brought him.
One of the kidnappers?
Who beats a man to death's door
and then takes him in to get medical care?
This doesn't fit the profile.
None of the other victims were beaten.
There was no indication of violence before they were killed.
The beatings, the urgency --
the unsubs are devolving.
They're becoming emotional.
The man on the phone was cold and rational.
Whoever did this has rage issues.
Yet someone showed compassion enough to take Peter in.
They're no longer working in concert.
There's gonna be a power struggle for control of the group.
Any time we thought we had is gone.
Wait a minute.
Peter's watch.
It's not here.
Casablanca P.D. already searched the town for it.
That was before when the unsubs were in control.
A few thousand dollars wasn't gonna get them what they needed,
but now they're desperate, losing rationality.
You think they would sell it?
Simmons, go to the map.
The bodies in the previous cases were all found
within three kilometers of the abduction sites.
Three-click radius from the bazaar.
Not much of a comfort zone, but the hospital fits inside.
Now, between the hospital and the bazaar,
where can you unload a $6,000 watch?
You mean like a jewelry district?
Well... Jewelry store owner said a kid came by
and hawked it this afternoon.
Said he came from the docks in a truck filled with blue cloth.
Of course. The Tuaregs.
They're -- they're traveling merchants.
That's the one thing we didn't see at the camp.
We were looking for the kidnappers,
not where they keep their merchandise.
That's it.
Hey, Monty.
We need a record search
for warehouse leases near the port.
Looking for a short-term rental the Tuaregs may be using
to store their wares for the festival.
Please, don't hurt me.
Uh, northwest corner of the block.
Tuaregs rented a warehouse for the duration of the festival.
Copy.
There's still a hostage inside.
No one moves without my signal.
Got eyes on.
Tell your men to back off.
Let her go, Ben.
We'll kill her. I swear it.
I know you will.
I know about the others.
You're too smart for this, Ben. Think about it.
You shoot the hostage, we're coming in.
We got three kidnappers. The big one's got a gun on Kate.
Jack, don't go in there.
Damn it.
You shoot me, they'll come through that door and kill you.
We all want the same thing --
for everyone to come out of this alive.
You don't want to see your brothers get hurt, now, do you?
Let her go.
This is about your mother, isn't it?
That's what the money's for -- so you can take care of her.
What do you care? No one cared when she got sick!
Let the woman go, and I'll see to it
that your mother is cared for.
American hospitals -- the best.
It's too late.
The cancer -- there's nothing we can do.
There is still time!
You heard the doctor.
One more surgery.
One more time and she will be fine!
No, brother! Medicine is not magic!
He took our money. He gave us false hope,
and now there is nothing we can do.
She is going to die.
They got nothing to lose.
That woman has a family.
If you kill her, you'll be causing her family
the same pain that you and your brothers
are trying to avoid.
We have a division. The big one's losing control.
Ben. You have to be the peacemaker.
You're the only one that can save your family here.
Hands up, Ben!
Shots fired! Shots fired!
Kidnapper down. Secure the hostages.
Agents are okay. We have control.
On your knees!
Clear.
I'm sorry for your loss.
And I thank you for respecting our traditions.
I will see he receives a proper burial
so his soul does not linger.
Even the misguided deserve peace in death.
What will happen with his brother?
He will be punished.
As it should be.
We know this was the work of desperate brothers.
Your tribe bears no responsibility
or shame for their actions.
To the contrary, friend.
We are all responsible for our brethren.
Thank you for returning the woman and her son.
She deserves to die with her tribe.
The boy?
He was brave.
He saved two hostages' lives.
The authorities have agreed not to prosecute.
We will see that he is well taken care of.
I think you may want this.
Maybe next time we'll leave the good jewelry at home.
There will be a next time?
Let's take it one step at a time, okay?
And please do let us know.
The I.R.T. has many friends around the world.
We'd be happy to make some calls to make sure
that you have a better experience next time around.
Thank you.
And, uh, thank you.
It's all in a day's work.
Now let's go home.
Oh, dad.
Now, there's about $400,000 worth of bitcoin here.
