my name is alexandria st. john .
i &apos;m your family , lorenzo .
here &apos;s what i know about the pills .
they &apos;re really only useful if you want to fight a witch .
what about the antidote ?
we tried to create the antidote , and we failed .
what ?
who could you have been giving them to ?
give bonnie bennett my regards .
everyone you know has made the choice that serves them best .
why not make a choice that serves you ?
i love you .
i love you .
when you destroyed the phoenix stone ,
all the souls inside escaped .
the spirits fled into the first
dead piece of flesh they could find .
cut the crap , buddy .
i know you &apos;re not stefan .
apparently he was a serial killer
before he became a vampire .
he would stalk sororities and fraternities
and murder for sport .
where did stefan go ?
he could be anywhere .
he could be anyone .
i got ripped out of hell
and thrown into a dead man &apos;s body .
this is not how you are going to die , stefan salvatore .
buckle up .
we have less than 48 hours to track down your real body .
stefan .
hey , stefan .
oh , what happened ?
well , i pulled your ass out of the snow ,
you ate a bunch of doughnuts ,
and then you puked blood all over my nice clean car .
you said &quot; everything hurt , &quot; so ...
i got you everything .
head stuff , throat stuff , stomach stuff .
yeah . where are we ?
on our way to memphis .
valerie got a line on your real body ,
the one with the nice hair .
how did my real body end up in memphis ?
you know what ?
long story .
how about you just focus on staying alive , okay ?
sit back , relax , find your happy place .
chug one of those five @-@ hour energy things ,
maybe with a cough syrup chaser or something .
okay .
plan &quot; b. &quot;
what are you doing ?
911 . what &apos;s your emergency ?
damon , i can &apos;t go to a hospital .
marty hammond got loaded and crashed a bus full of kids .
there &apos;s an interstate manhunt going on .
don &apos;t worry , brother .
i &apos;m not taking you to a hospital .
i &apos;m bringing the hospital to us .
i had to improvise .
the over @-@ the @-@ counter stuff wasn &apos;t working .
that &apos;s frank and that &apos;s sully .
hi , guys .
how you doin &apos; ?
i &apos;ve asked them very politely
to make sure that marty stays alive , and if he doesn &apos;t ,
then i will cut their thumbs off
and feed them to the squirrels .
right , guys ?
meanwhile , you and i will go hunt down the sociopath
that has taken residence in my brother ,
and then valerie will jam his real soul back ... in ...
where &apos;s my witch ?
she &apos;s at a motel off route 70,
prepping for the spell .
prepping for the spell ? what does that even mean ?
what could she possibly have to prep ?
i guess it &apos;s a little more complicated than that .
at any rate ,
she managed to do a locator spell
on the serial killer in stefan &apos;s body .
his name &apos;s ambrose .
turns out , he &apos;s holed up in a frat house near memphis college .
maybe he &apos;ll be so busy snacking on drunk sorority girls
that this &apos;ll be an easy smash and grab .
listen , thanks for coming all this way to help out , buddy .
means a lot .
yeah , well , i didn &apos;t exactly volunteer , damon .
valerie sort of ambushed me .
well , you know , she probably thought
that you &apos;d feel good about stepping up for an old friend .
especially since you &apos;re planning on marrying his ex .
you sure this is how you want to play it , damon ?
you know , maybe you bought marty an hour or so ,
but when the same thing happened to jo ...
i don &apos;t know , maybe you want to consider
spending your remaining time just ...
being with your brother .
did you seriously just suggest that i spend the afternoon
saying a sappy good @-@ bye to stefan
instead of saving his life ?
getting soft , ric .
more than soft .
your brain has liquefied .
get in .
thing is ,
i cared about him more than anyone else in the world .
but it wasn &apos;t enough .
i mean , he walked away like
it was the easiest thing in the world to do .
then i find out he &apos;s back and
hasn &apos;t bothered to contact me .
i think , how could i have fallen into such a dark place
over someone who cares so little about me ?
i &apos;ve decided i &apos;m ready to move on .
i &apos;m not gonna let that betrayal define the rest of my life .
thank you , bonnie .
nice progress .
virginia ?
did you have something you wanted to share ?
no .
so what &apos;d i miss when i was gone ?
what &apos;s been happening ?
wouldn &apos;t know .
oh , come on .
maybe you buried your head in a dallas sandbox ,
but your wife @-@ to @-@ be ,
she &apos;s always had her nose in everyone &apos;s business ,
which is why i find it hard to believe
that she wouldn &apos;t drop some details about her best friend
over string cheese and chicken nuggets .
look , damon ,
if you &apos;re fishing for information about bonnie ,
i suggest you go straight to the source .
i totally would ,
but she didn &apos;t leave a forwarding address with my storage unit .
ah , it doesn &apos;t matter .
it &apos;ll give carebear and i something to talk about at the reception .
yeah , well , we &apos;re not actually having a big wedding thing .
just a few friends .
since when do you have friends besides me ?
we made new ones .
look , i know this has been just a catnap for you , damon ,
but it &apos;s been three years in the real world .
people change .
life goes on .
it wasn &apos;t a catnap , ric .
i made an excruciatingly painful descent into a near @-@ death state
so i wouldn &apos;t destroy everyone that i loved .
you know what ? now that we know where ambrose is all camped out ,
i think i &apos;m gonna get back to my life now .
so if you don &apos;t mind taking me to the airport
or a train station or ...
even this bus stop pulling up here , yeah ,
if you want to pull over ...
and there it goes .
look , i get you &apos;re mad . okay ?
i shouldn &apos;t have said good @-@ bye in a letter .
i should &apos;ve flown to dallas and taken you out for drinks
and line dancing and told you face @-@ to @-@ face .
i &apos;m very sorry , ric .
just let me make it up to you , huh ?
oh , you know , damon , i &apos;m really not interested
in being part of your 12 @-@ step redemption tour .
one more mission , for old time &quot; sake , huh ?
i can assure you that saving my little brother
will be much more fun than putting together old broken @-@ up baby dolls .
yeah , well , i &apos;m not really a big fan of your brother right now , either .
he broke caroline &apos;s heart when he abandoned her .
worked out pretty well for you , didn &apos;t it ?
oh , come on .
help me out . be a hero .
i mean , unless you don &apos;t think
caroline cares whether stefan lives or dies .
where &apos;s your girl tonight ?
my girl ?
valerie ?
tall , pretty ,
likes the drinks with the little pink umbrellas .
or do you have more than one ?
no , no , no .
just ... just one .
need any help ?
what are you trying to write ?
an apology .
&quot; i wish that things were different ,
but it &apos;s safer this way .
never meant to hurt you ,
and i wish you all the happiness in the world . &quot;
well , sounds good to me .
she returns all of them unopened .
maybe this is the one she &apos;ll read .
right .
everything okay , buddy ?
do you have a piece of paper and a pen ?
i need to write a letter ,
in case i don &apos;t make it out of this .
chug ! chug ! chug ! chug !
damon !
i was wondering if you &apos;d show up .
come in , friend .
have a drink .
oh , dear .
looks like you &apos;re a pledge who didn &apos;t make the cut .
i guess now you &apos;ll just have to slog through
a bit of old @-@ fashioned hazing .
okay , so ...
i couldn &apos;t get past the threshold .
you &apos;re on deck .
got you a disguise .
here , put that on .
you can go as the , uh , creepy professor pretending to be chaperone .
i booked a 5 : 15 into dallas / fort worth .
even used my miles .
you &apos;re not fooling anyone , ric .
you know that ?
you leveled a rifle on me when i showed up at your house .
i know you &apos;re still in the game .
i &apos;m not in the game because i possess the means
to protect my family from some uninvited lurker .
it &apos;s my brother &apos;s life we &apos;re talking about here , ric .
if you &apos;re not gonna do it for me ,
at least do it for the guy who stepped aside
and made this perfect , happy life
that you &apos;re just dying to get back to possible .
yeah ?
are you damon salvatore ?
well , that depends on who &apos;s asking .
he said if you don &apos;t answer this ,
i &apos;m supposed to run into traffic .
i &apos;m answering .
so i hear your vampire m.o. is
payback for you being a greek system reject .
kind of cliché , don &apos;t you think ?
why don &apos;t you come on back here , damon ?
i &apos;m sure i can remember which attractive ,
overprivileged parasite owns this place .
well , the only parasite i &apos;m interested in is you .
you know , i actually don &apos;t care much for the taste of blood .
what i do love are the less obvious perks .
eavesdropping skills , mind games .
of course , it &apos;s fun to wantonly murder these class @-@ obsessed imbeciles ,
but making them kill each other ?
oh , that really takes the egg .
this is all fascinating , really .
here &apos;s the thing : i can &apos;t hear you that well .
i don &apos;t think the reception &apos;s that good in there .
why don &apos;t you just come out
and deliver your villainous monologue face @-@ to @-@ face ?
what do you think ?
look , damon , i know you won &apos;t leave me alone
until you get your brother &apos;s body back .
so why don &apos;t you do me one small favor
and we both get what we want ?
how small ?
rayna cruz .
she chased me across this country for a decade ,
made my life hell .
literally . yours , too , i hear .
what about her ?
well , let &apos;s just say
i made things personal with her .
framed her for a couple of massacres .
turned her boyfriend .
she won &apos;t be satisfied until i &apos;m dead .
in fact , she &apos;s probably on her way over here right now .
so why don &apos;t you go ahead and kill her for me ,
and i promise i will turn your brother &apos;s body back over to you .
and why would you do that ?
clearly , you are not familiar with the loophole .
well , i can easily jump into the body of a transitioning vampire .
all you need to do is find me a witch
who can soul @-@ swap me
into the body of a fellow you don &apos;t care about ,
and stefan can have his body back .
i , in turn , can mount rayna cruz &apos;s head on my wall .
everybody wins .
what do you say , damon ?
consider it done .
wonderful .
how &apos;s stefan ?
well , old marty &apos;s heart &apos;s still beating ,
thanks to the miracle of modern medicine .
i &apos;m now sending him to the beautiful wildwood motel in a big red truck .
little sirens on the top , white stripe on the side .
you can &apos;t miss it .
and what about ambrose ?
what is taking so long ?
i &apos;m out here busting my ass
trying to catch this candy shell of a man that you love .
you &apos;re the one holed up in the motel ,
eating vending machine crackers , so just give me a break , okay ?
gemini spells usually take two witches , damon .
i &apos;m trying to gather the strength to ensure
that i can actually get him back into his own body .
so you &apos;re saying you can &apos;t do it ?
no , i didn &apos;t say that .
i &apos;m not the kind of guy that likes to live in the middle , val .
you can either do it
or you can &apos;t .
everyone i &apos;ve ever loved in this entire world is gone .
stefan is the only thing i have left .
i &apos;ll do whatever i have to do to get it done .
okay .
good . good .
now , question :
any chance you could spare some of that strength
to do a locator spell on rayna cruz ?
i majored in poli @-@ sci ,
but , like , obviously ,
what do you do with a poli @-@ sci degree ? so ...
that is why i am doing this .
uh , only for now .
hey , you , uh ... you okay back there ?
you know , if you puke in my car ,
i got to ding you with zero stars .
i &apos;m fine .
how much farther ?
oh , not far .
you &apos;re gonna love these guys .
they throw parties that rage for , like , three days .
what the heck ?
no . don &apos;t stop . don &apos;t stop .
sorry . got to stop .
says so in the bylaws .
sit here .
don &apos;t call anyone , don &apos;t move .
thanks .
can you check to see if i &apos;ve got any messages from my doctor ?
what are you doing ?
you &apos;ve been stealing my meds .
what ?
every day , when you get your meds , you ask the nurse ,
&quot; hey , do i have any messages from my doctor ? &quot;
then she looks ,
and you swap my meds with sugar pills .
why are you stealing my meds ?
because none of us are gonna get well
if we can &apos;t think straight .
you just seemed to be in a weird fog .
i wanted to help .
thank you .
i finally feel like myself again .
and i haven &apos;t felt like myself in a really long time .
you want to get something to eat ?
i know where the nurses hide their candy bars .
yeah . sure .
well , that doesn &apos;t look good .
what the hell happened here ?
i had a fare .
i was taking her to a frat party ,
and some guy with an accent
shot up the car and dragged her away .
damon . to what do i owe the pleasure ?
bring her back .
no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
isn &apos;t it a little embarrassing ,
still playing fetch for the armory ?
i &apos;m no longer affiliated with that organization .
try to keep up .
fine . enlighten me .
what are your exact needs for rayna cruz at this moment ?
because i promise you , i need her a lot more than you do .
oh , is that so ?
well , then let me ask you a question :
how &apos;s bonnie ?
you know , the best friend that you just abandoned .
what &apos;s her life been like
since you decided to just push the pause button
on your pathetic existence ?
we &apos;re not talking about bonnie right now .
we &apos;re talking about stefan , who is currently dying ,
and the fact that rayna is the only key to his survival .
well , then i suggest you find another way to save him .
because you &apos;re not getting her .
they are together .
what ?
bonnie and enzo .
they are together .
together , as in ,
someone kidnapped bonnie bennett
and brainwashed her into a relationship with enzo , or ... ?
as in , bonnie got into trouble with the armory
when you decided to take your hibernation vacation .
enzo stepped up and helped her out .
i guess , you know ,
things happened from there .
thought you didn &apos;t know anything .
your barbie dream phone is ringing .
i was just about to call you .
you know what i &apos;ve realized ?
between this game of beer pong and the extremely short shorts ,
modern greek life is even less dignified than it once was .
listen , we hit a little bump in the road .
i hope that means you ran over rayna cruz
and strapped her to the hood of your vehicle .
ambrose , brother ,
nothing would make me happier
than exterminating our little huntress friend . okay ?
but i &apos;m gonna need you to take a rain check
on the hit .
now , listen , i promise i &apos;m gonna get to it .
it &apos;s just , she &apos;s currently out of range right now ,
and i am running out of time .
what do you say ? we have a deal ?
this sense of disappointment must be
what it feels like to actually have you for a brother .
so how &apos;d you end up in here ?
same as you , i guess .
i was betrayed by someone i loved .
except it was my family , not my boyfriend .
oh , no . damon was not my boyfriend .
he was ...
i don &apos;t know what he was .
that &apos;s even worse .
so what happened with your family ?
let &apos;s just say
i tried to save them from something ... dark .
turns out , they didn &apos;t want to be saved .
so my sister had me drugged up
and locked away in this psych ward .
got everyone to say i &apos;m crazy ,
which i &apos;m not .
yeah .
must be hard being a member of the st. john family .
you know who my family is ?
is that why you &apos;re here ? to spy on me ?
no . no .
do you work for them ?
no !
your sister alex is looking for me .
the whole armory is looking for me .
why ? i have no idea .
i faked a story
and checked myself into this place a few weeks ago ,
hoping you could help me figure it out .
they &apos;ve been hunting me for almost three years .
if you &apos;re expecting me to give you some ... pearl of wisdom ,
you &apos;re out of luck .
that &apos;s what my family does . they hunt things .
weapons , relics , people .
and they don &apos;t stop until they get exactly what they want .
i need my life back .
if there &apos;s anything you can tell me ...
i &apos;m a bennett witch .
does that mean anything to you ?
prove it .
do magic .
i can &apos;t .
i don &apos;t have access to my magic right now .
if you really were a bennett witch ,
they would have tracked you down a long time ago .
i found a way to hide from them .
that i can prove .
if you promise to keep my secret .
i &apos;ll keep your secret ...
if you promise that you &apos;ll break me out when you go .
deal .
hey , what happened ?
you think he went after rayna himself ?
no .
he wouldn &apos;t know where to look .
that &apos;s why he made me the hit man .
maybe he &apos;s looking for his next murder party .
or maybe he &apos;s just gonna keep running until ...
marty drops dead with my brother still on board ?
&quot; on board . &quot;
hey , do you think he overheard you
tell the drivers where to take marty ?
you were just outside the house when you said it .
oh , no .
maybe he figures he can get me off his back
if he snuffs out marty ,
and then i won &apos;t need stefan &apos;s body anymore .
this is frank .
tell me you &apos;re not still driving , frank .
we hit a little accident @-@ related traffic a few miles back .
what is the point of having an emergency vehicle
if you can &apos;t run other cars out of the way ? !
sorry about that .
do not stop again !
do not pass go , do not collect $ 200 .
turn on the lights on the top of the van , frank ,
and deliver him to a very powerful witch woman
before some lunatic tries to off my brother .
copy that .
hey , sully ?
we got to turn on the lights .
bull &apos;s @-@ eye .
hey , buddy ,
you okay ?
me ?
oh , i &apos;m well .
thank you .
how about you , friend ?
are you hurt ?
what about you , stefan ?
are you ready to meet your maker ?
i guess being human still has a few privileges .
not you again .
afraid so .
lucky for me , you seem to be a bit off your game today .
i would rather die than go back to the armory .
i &apos;ll strangle myself with this seatbelt if i have to .
don &apos;t bother . they know where you are .
seems that alex st. john got everything she needed from you .
so what am i missing ?
why am i here ?
let &apos;s just say that i have my reasons .
wow , that &apos;s specific .
are we playing 20 questions now ?
great . i &apos;m game .
are you aware that the armory has engineered
a type of pill that suppresses magic ?
if i take one of these every day ,
they can &apos;t do a locator spell on me .
the downside is i don &apos;t have access to any magic .
how &apos;d the armory make something like that ?
you ever hear of a vampire hunter named rayna cruz ?
they used her blood
to make the pills i &apos;ve been taking .
if you help me , you &apos;ll be free to move away .
what kind of help are you looking for ?
i need to know if the effects of those pills can be reversed .
or i could slit your throat and throw you in a dumpster .
it depends on your attitude .
sorry , i guess it &apos;s the dumpster for me , then .
the effects of my blood can &apos;t be reversed ,
only enhanced .
how do you know ?
if i put enough of these through your eyeballs ,
you &apos;ll probably never wake up .
the armory already tried .
they failed .
magic doesn &apos;t behave like science .
don &apos;t shoot the messenger .
this isn &apos;t a matter of idle curiosity , is it ?
you stole those pills and gave them to someone you care about .
you know what would be a terrible shame ?
is if that person were a witch .
say ... bonnie bennett .
because that would mean
you just gave the girl you love a death sentence .
you look like you &apos;re in pretty bad shape , stefan , hmm ?
wouldn &apos;t you rather just get this over with ?
think of it this way .
at least you won &apos;t have to go back to the hell stone .
you just have the sweet release of death to look forward to .
portable stoves .
what will they think of next ?
i think i &apos;m really going to enjoy my life in this new world .
i &apos;ve read your journals , stefan .
and i know you &apos;re a deeply sensitive ,
literary sort of fellow .
is there any final words you &apos;d like me to deliver ?
fun &apos;s over .
on the contrary .
fun &apos;s just begun .
i hate how good that felt .
now tell me why the armory is looking for me .
you also promised to get me out of this place , remember ?
do you have a key or a code or something ?
i have a doctor who can check us both out ,
but not before you tell me what i need to know .
there &apos;s a vault in the basement of the armory .
it was sealed by a bennett witch a long time ago ,
and only a bennett witch can unlock it .
so they want me to open a vault ?
as far as my family knew , lucy bennett
was the only living witch in your line .
and she disappeared about four years ago .
i &apos;m not sure why we didn &apos;t know about you .
i was officially dead for a while .
then i wasn &apos;t .
it was a long story .
what &apos;s in this vault ?
something that can &apos;t be let out .
gonna need you to be a little more specific .
first you have to swear that you &apos;ll never open it .
if this vault is the key to my freedom ,
i can &apos;t promise you anything
until i know what &apos;s in it .
i was hoping you &apos;d be ...
on my side .
what are you doing ?
sorry .
i can &apos;t let you open the vault .
get out !
let me go ! let me go ! she &apos;s a witch !
she &apos;s trying to break out !
you have to stop her , please !
you have to stop her ! she can &apos;t open that vault !
she can &apos;t open ...
the vault ...
you all right , ms. mccullough ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll get you back to where you belong .
don &apos;t worry .
thank you for doing all this .
snagged this from the front desk .
in case we have to restart marty &apos;s ticker .
damon &apos;s the one you should be thanking .
she didn &apos;t think i &apos;d come through ,
even though stefan &apos;s well @-@ being
is the one and only thing we have in common .
don &apos;t thank me .
just promise me you can do this .
i promise .

care for a drink ?
what am i doing here ?
well , you know what they say .
there &apos;s no place like home .
you &apos;re in my head , aren &apos;t you ?
no matter where we traveled ,
you were always going on and on
about how much you missed this musty old house .
i figured you &apos;d be more comfortable here .
and i wanted to see the real you .
do i even want to know what &apos;s happening out there ?
you &apos;re going to be fine .
promise .
you wouldn &apos;t happen to be lying to me , would you ?
because if i &apos;m about to die a painful death
in a strange human &apos;s body ,
then i want to make the most of my time .
the only thing you need to worry about is our next destination .
any ideas ?
or would you rather
spin the old globe in the upstairs study
and let fate decide ?
well , i &apos;ve actually had a lot of time to think lately .
i suppose there &apos;s something about standing on the precipice of death
that lends itself to deep thoughts .
and i wouldn &apos;t have to run anymore .
i wouldn &apos;t have the scar .
my life wouldn &apos;t be tied to rayna &apos;s .
well , we wouldn &apos;t have to call it running .
we could call it sightseeing .
or we could stay closer to home .
&quot; home &quot; ?
you do remember we can &apos;t go back to mystic falls , right ?
matt donovan made sure of that .
unless you &apos;re talking about somewhere else .
dallas , maybe ?
no .
of course not .
but things are different now .
and you have a chance to go back to your real life .
you are my real life .
valerie ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
... mentim menta .
phesmatos spirita ...
valerie ? valerie ?
are you okay ?
yeah ...
no , no , no , no ! hey , get up .
hey , you promised me . get up .
you promised you could do this .
get up ! valerie , get up !
valerie , what &apos;s happening ?
be honest .
have i only been a pleasant distraction these past few years ,
or am i something more ?
what ? no , you &apos;ve never been a distraction .
valerie !
it &apos;s the spell .
it &apos;s hurting you .
valerie ? valerie ?
valerie , get up !
damon , stop . she &apos;s not strong enough .
yes , she is !
she &apos;s not gonna let him die .
hey , get up !
you promised me you could do this .

valerie , stop the spell right now .
it &apos;s too strong for you . it &apos;s killing you .
no .
valerie , stop it !
no , i @-@ i ... i promised you &apos;d be fine .
do not sacrifice yourself for me .
do you understand ?
i have no intention of breaking that promise .
valerie , please ?
please , stop .
you &apos;re all i have .
valerie ?
valerie , stop the spell .
stop !
valerie ...
valerie ?
valerie !
stefan ?
it &apos;s me .
it &apos;s me .
hey , wait up .
ric !
ric , come on , man , where are you going ?
where i wanted to go all day .
home .
oh , ric .
i &apos;m trying here , man .
i am .
i shouldn &apos;t have abandoned you .
that was a terrible thing to do .
i &apos;m sorry .
but just tell me whatever amends i need to make ,
or whatever bridges i need to build ,
and let &apos;s ...
let &apos;s get back to the way things were .
right ?
you want to know why the last three years
have been the happiest of my life ?
because i got to start over .
because i have two little girls that i absolutely love ,
a job that i actually earned ,
and a fiancée that makes me feel so lucky to be alive .
and i did all that without you
barging into my life and screwing things up .
damon , no offense ,
but i don &apos;t want things to go back to the way they were .
well ...
thanks for being honest .
bonnie &apos;s undercover
in a psych ward in asheville .
you might have better luck winning her back .
better ?
better .
catching up on your , uh , correspondence ?
i was trying to write you a letter .
like the ones you used to write caroline
when you thought i wasn &apos;t looking .
i &apos;m standing right here .
you don &apos;t have to write me a letter .
i heard the fear in your voice .
you weren &apos;t afraid of dying .
you were afraid that i was going to die for you .
yeah , of course i was .
you were afraid that it wouldn &apos;t have been worth it .
me sacrificing myself for you .
because you don &apos;t love me the way i love you .
and the guilt of that sacrifice would eat you alive .
valerie ...
the truth is ...
i &apos;ve never loved anyone the way i love you .
but that &apos;s not true for you .
and now , by some miracle ,
you get the chance to go back
and make things right with caroline .
i know you never meant to hurt me .
i even know that you loved me in your own way .
and maybe if things had been different ,
if the world had been kinder to us ,
i could &apos;ve been the love of your life , too .
your small , quiet , human life .
i &apos;m so sorry .
don &apos;t be .
i think it will be good for me .
to find a new life that &apos;s completely my own .
i &apos;ve never had that .
i know you don &apos;t always believe this , but ...
you deserve to be happy , stefan .
please be happy .
you , too .
the hospital left a message with your doctor .
said you had an incident with another patient .
it &apos;s just a scratch , doctor .
but it was all worth it ,
because guess who knows why i &apos;m on the armory &apos;s most wanted list .
virginia st. john .
turns out , there &apos;s some kind of vault in the basement
of that pretentious building .
sealed by a bennett witch .
alex st. john wants me to open it .
now we just have to figure out what &apos;s inside
and the best way to leverage my freedom .
after you check me out of this place
and take me out for dinner .
because if i have to eat another piece of runny beige casserole ,
i might actually lose my mind .
what &apos;s wrong ?
you can &apos;t take these anymore , love .
i got a lead , not all the answers .
i still need to stay off the armory &apos;s radar .
the pills are making you sick .
what are you talking about ? i feel fine .
i didn &apos;t , i didn &apos;t know , but the armory was ,
was @-@ was experimenting on mary louise .
they forced these pills down her throat every day
for the past three years ,
and as a result , she became very ...
very ill .
i thought she blew herself up .
it &apos;s because she knew she was dying .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m , i &apos;m so ...
sorry .
uh , i @-@ i thought i was protecting you .
i &apos;m gonna die ?
is that what you &apos;re trying to tell me ?
because i &apos;ve done it once or twice before ,
and it &apos;s not all that fun .
no . i will not let that happen .
i will not let you die , bonnie bennett .
you have my word .
bonnie ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t ...
i , um ...
i ...
