You took everything from me, Klaus.
Let bygones be bygones. Resentment gets old.
No one ever gets old? Revenge.
No.
What's the matter, Klaus, missing something?
Three sleeping originals, four coffins.
Who is in the locked box?
I think I know who can open the coffin, Stefan.
Who is this?
It's my mom.
I want to help you.
You have no magic and I don't trust you.
Maybe you can help me get my magic back.
To break the sire bond, you've to make yourself turn.
Oh, my god.
Run!
Is he going to make it?
Not on his own.
What is that?
Vampire blood.
Show me the coffins.
Where's the fourth?
It's not here.
I assume that means Klaus didn't get his coffins.
I was only able to get one of them out in time--the locked one.
Probably a good choice.
So why don't we talk about this?
What did you do?
Elijah?
You look surprised to see me.
So it wasn't you that removed the dagger from my chest.
You look like you could do with a drink.
And we have a lot to discuss, so shall we?
Easy! I just finished renovating!
You know, you have every right to be mad at me,
but I kept my word.
I reunited you with our family.
Don't make me do this to you again, Elijah!
Come on. Use it.
I dare you.
You'll have Kol to death with.
Mikael is dead.
What did you say?
I killed him. With his own weapon.
He's gone, Elijah, forever.
Why do our family remain in these coffins?
Finn for over 900 years, Kol for over a century.
Because of Stefan Salvatore.
He holds the one thing keeping me from freeing them.
There are things that you do not know about our past, Elijah.
Our mother's death. Things I never wanted you to know.
But I'm ready to tell you now.
I only ask that you remember
the oath of loyalty you once swore to me.
What are you doing?
Always and forever.
I need you
to stand by my side.
Be my brother.
Help me... destroy Stefan,
and I promise you,
our family will be whole again.
Morning.
Thought we had aspirin.
Yeah, in the vitamins.
You're hungover.
Yeah, sorry about that.
It was a bit of a weird night.
I told you, you don't have to feel guilty
about inviting Meredith over here.
I know.
And I thank you for that.
But I do feel a little guilty for
whisky dialing her at 2 in the a.m.
No, you didn't.
Oh, yes, I did.
Was she cool about it?
Well, as soon as these aspirin kick in
and I remember the conversation,
I'll let you know.
Sheriff Forbes, hi.
Is everything ok?
This is an unconventional
conversation we're about to have,
so I hope you'll protect me on it.
Of course.
I assume you both heard our medical examiner was murdered
the night of the wickery bridge fundraiser.
Yeah.
Brian Walters. Why?
We've been investigating.
Someone drove this stake through his heart.
It's one of ours.
I mean, this is one of a set from your parents' lake house.
That's why I'm here. I haven't told anyone,
but forensics ran it for prints
and found only one clean set.
Yours.
What?
So you're the prime suspect, huh?
She doesn't think that I did it.
She's just trying to find out why
someone used one of my family's weapons to kill a council member.
Well, why don't you just ask Ric
if his dirty little doctor had access to the weapons.
You're on speaker phone, dick.
I'm just saying,
first suspect is usually the right one.
Don't get so defensive.
Brian Walters was killed days ago, all right?
I didn't show Meredith this stuff until last night.
It wasn't Meredith.
But Brian Walters was her ex-boyfriend
and Ric saw them fighting that night.
It's not Meredith. Ok?
I refuse to believe that your luck with women is that tragic.
Who else knows about your secret little slayer stash?
Who doesn't? I've got weapons everywhere.
Here, the school, my loft, your car.
It's Klaus. Has to be.
He's just screwing with us.
I wonder if it was Stefan.
He was crazy that night.
You know, he was trying to get underneath Klaus' skin.
He was capable of pretty much anything.
Ah, makes me nostalgic for the time
when Stefan was a bunny-snacking pacifist.
Anyway, got to go. More later.
Hey, where are you?
Tea with an old friend.
Elijah.
My favorite original,
back from the dead.
You clean up nice.
You left something...
in my jacket pocket.
Oh, yeah.
Dear Elijah,
let's get together,
plot the destruction of your brother.
Xo, xo.
Damon.
Was I right to undagger you,
or are we going to have a problem?
I'm here. Let's talk.
Well, let's start with an easy question...
Any idea what kind of Klaus killing weapon
could be magically sealed in a mystery coffin?
Slow down!
Keep up. We don't have much time.
Sorry, Stefan, but I didn't have a choice.
There was a choice, Bonnie. You made it
and now we have to live with it.
I told Klaus where the coffins were, and he took them.
All of them except this one.
That's the one that's sealed?
Yep.
Unfortunately, it seems to be the one he cares about most.
Aren't you coming inside?
Vampires can't get in. Damon had to compel
a couple of the Lockwood gardeners to bring the coffin in.
This is a bad idea.
Look, if you're really the key to opening up that coffin,
I think it's a pretty safe bet you're on Klaus' hit list.
So I suggest you hide out in here
and figure out a way to open the damn thing.
I told you, I don't have any powers.
And I don't believe you.
Time's ticking.
Won't be long before Klaus calls his hybrids
to find that coffin and kill all of us.
So dig deep, Abby Bennett.
Scrape out whatever magic you have left.
What are you doing here?
Bonnie told me that you guys would be here.
I need to talk to you.
Well, there's nothing to talk about.
I'm just focused on getting this coffin open.
Did you kill the medical examiner?
Why would you think I did that?
Maybe because I don't know what you're capable of anymore.
Well, believe what you want, Elena.
I don't want to believe any of it, Stefan.
But you had to ask me anyway.
Stefan...
Did you ask Damon
if he killed anybody lately?
Are you Caroline?
Yes. Dr. Fell, hi.
Elena told me you helped out my dad.
I did. Do you think you can get him to be a little more grateful?
He spent half the night threatening to get
my medical license revoked for saving his life.
Yeah, my dad's a little... set in his ways.
Um, he spent his whole life hating vampires.
So--
So he's not psyched about it being vampire blood that healed him.
Yeah, he made that clear.
I'm sorry.
My bedside manner sucks on no sleep.
Um, so, can I take him home?
I signed his discharge papers late last night,
just to shut him up.
Oh, I...
He didn't call or anything.
That's got to be hard.
When your dad hates the one thing you can't change about yourself.
I make it my business to know who the vampires are in this town.
Medical curiosity. I don't blab.
Yeah, we've had our ups and downs.
Tell your dad I said you're welcome.
Thanks.
That was fast.
Yeah, he's not here. He was already discharged.
And she seems perfectly nice, by the way.
A little intense, maybe.
But I think it's sweet you want to make sure
Alaric's not dating a total psycho.
He's my family. I have to look out for him.
Shh, shh, shh.
What?
I hear it.
Hear what?
My dad's phone.
Oh, my god! Dad! Daddy! Dad?! Oh!
Oh, my god.
Don't be dead, don't be dead, don't be dead!
Oh, my god!
Daddy!
Caroline...
He has vampire blood in his system.
What?!
This is the only grimoire you kept?
It was the only one I needed.
So...what is all of this?
Family history.
About a mother who loved her children so much,
she couldn't bear the thought she might lose them.
So she turned them into vampires.
One of them is Klaus.
The one you're trying to kill with whatever's in that coffin?
There's nothing in here that's going to help.
I've seen most of these spells.
What was this?
It's the spell I used to seal Mikael in the tomb.
I burned it, tried to get it out of my head.
Didn't work, though.
Wait...do you see this?
It's a sealing spell.
We're trying to open something. Not seal it shut.
No. Right here. On the side.
It's a blood knot. It means to bind it, you need two generations.
A bloodline.
Like, two keys to a safety deposit box.
So...
unbinding it
would reverse the spell.
Unseal it.
If we did it together.
Get dressed. We're going out.
Yeah, sorry, not interested.
I didn't ask. Elijah and I have
scheduled a very old-fashioned sit-down with you and Klaus.
I say go with the black.
Makes you look all villain-y.
Klaus won't make a deal, Damon.
He didn't have to.
All we're doing is buying a little time
to give our wicked witches a chance
to pop the top off the coffin.
So that's your, uh, your plan? Stall Klaus.
Well, if you hadn't gone postal on his hybrids,
then maybe I'd have some options.
So you unleash an original to help him out.
Undaggering Elijah was smart, Stefan.
Are you kidding me? After what Klaus did to him,
he's in vengeance mode. It's perfect.
Nothing smart about trusting Elijah, Damon.
He screwed us over the last time.
He promised to help us kill Klaus.
Yeah, the way you've been acting,
I'd trust him about as much as I trust you.
Hmm. Well...
Guess that goes both ways, doesn't it?
Oh, yes.
This is about me kissing Elena.
Just remember, if it wasn't for Klaus,
you wouldn't have become such a dick
and that kiss would never have happened.
So get ready and get happy.
We're going to negotiate a fake truce,
and I don't want your attitude screwing it up.
I compelled the nurse to stay out of this room.
You'll be safe here.
My wound has completely healed.
I need something to eat.
Daddy, why don't you just come lay down and just relax.
I can't. I'm too wired and my pulse is racing.
That's the effect of my body wanting to transition.
Well, maybe Dr. Fell could give you something.
She's done enough.
I called your mom.
Thanks.
Mr. Forbes, did you see your attacker?
I didn't see anything.
Tried to sneak out the back exit and someone came up from behind.
Look, we'll figure this out, but in the meantime,
we need to get you some blood.
I'm not going to drink any blood.
You have to.
You died with vampire blood in your system.
If you don't feed and finish the transition
into a vampire, then you'll die.
I understand how it works.
And that's what I'm prepared to do.
Now get me out of this hospital.
I smell blood everywhere.
What are you doing?
Taking inventory. Did you bring it?
You mean did I steal evidence from a crime scene?
Yes.
You're right.
It's a match.
This is from a crawl space in the foyer.
Which means Meredith knew where it was.
That doesn't mean she stole it.
This is from the loft.
These are from the duffel in Damon's car.
Identical to the one that killed Brian Walters.
Damon's car was at the Wickery Bridge Fundraiser.
So was Meredith. And that was the night
her ex- boyfriend, the medical examiner, was killed.
The one who called her psycho.
If she was trying to save Bill Forbes,
why would she turn around and try to kill him?
I don't know what to believe, either.
You know, but...
We'd be idiots to ignore all these facts.
So what should we do?
Get this to the police.
Then you should probably be with Caroline.
I'm sorry, Ric.
Please be careful.
Niklaus, our guests have arrived.
Damon. Stefan.
Elijah tells me you seek an audience.
Very bold.
Let's discuss the term of our agreement
like civilized men, shall we?
It's better to indulge him.
I didn't, uh,
come here to eat, Klaus.
In fact, I didn't want to come here at all.
But I was told I had to,
'cause you would hear us out.
Well, we can sit and eat,
or I can reach down your throats
and pull out your insides.
Choice is yours.
Thank you, love.
You lost your appetite.
Eat. I thought we agreed
that we would leave the grumpy Stefan at home.
That's the spirit.
Isn't this nice?
The four of us dining together.
Such a treat.
Is this what you had in mind
when you pulled the dagger out of my brother?
Well, I know what he felt about you,
so I figured, the more... the merrier.
Well, Elijah and I have had our share
of quarrels over the centuries, but we always make it through.
Kind of like, uh, you and Rebekah, right?
Where is she, by the way?
Last I checked, she was still daggered,
because you were afraid to face her.
If you're referring to the fact
that Rebekah knows I killed our mother...
I've already come clean to Elijah.
Hey, Stef, remember when you killed dad?
Might want to dial down the judgment till dessert.
We're here to make a deal, Damon.
Doesn't mean we need to kiss his ass for seven courses.
I'm just saying, we have a long evening ahead of us.
Pace yourself.
Did you hear back from Tyler yet?
No.
And I've left messages for him everywhere.
I...
So does Alaric really think that Dr. Fell did it?
He doesn't know what to think.
What about you?
I wish the girl Alaric liked
wasn't in the middle of all of this.
He deserves to be happy.
But, yeah. She looks guilty.
That's why I told your mom.
My mom's in there sitting with my dad.
And I don't think they've been in the same room
this long since I was 10 years old.
Is there any chance that Tyler did it?
What?
If Klaus was trying to mess with you,
and he's sired to Klaus, and...
he does everything that he's told...
No.
No, I don't think Tyler did it.
Well, I can't just let my father die.
I'm going... I'm going to force him to feed.
But he doesn't want to, Caroline.
The only thing your dad has...
is his choice.
I hated him so much for what he did to me.
So much.
Now all I want to do is save his life.
Well, of course you do. He's your dad.
What was the hardest part for you?
When you lost your dad?
Realizing all the things
that he wouldn't be there for.
The things that, um...
that you just need your dad for, you know?
Stefan. Where is the lovely Elena tonight?
I don't know. Ask Damon.
I'm sorry, you missed so much.
Ah, Trouble in Paradise.
One more word about Elena,
and, uh, this dinner is over.
You know what, probably best just to keep Elena
in the do not discuss pile.
You're probably right.
Yeah.
It's just the allure of the Petrova doppelganger is still so strong.
What do you say, brother?
Should we tell them about Tatia?
Now why should we discuss matters long since resolved?
Well, given their shared affection for both Elena and Katerina,
I think our guests might be curious to learn about
the originator of the Petrova line.
Well, we're not going anywhere, Elijah.
Please, do tell.
When our family first settled here,
there was a girl named Tatia.
She was an exquisite beauty.
Every boy of age desired to be her suitor.
Even though she'd had a child by another man.
And none loved her more than Niklaus.
Oh, I'd say there was one
who loved her at least as much.
Wait a minute, so you both loved the same girl?
Our mother was a very powerful witch.
She sought to end our feud over Tatia,
and so she took her.
And klaus and I would later learn
that it was Tatia's blood that we consumed
in the wine on the night where our mother
performed the spell which turned us into vampires.
Tatia wouldn't make a decision between the two of us,
so for a time, Niklaus and I...
grew estranged.
Harsh words were traded.
We even came to blows. Didn't we, brother?
But in the end, we recognized
the sacred bond of family.
Family above...all.
Family above all.
You're not trying.
We've been at this for over an hour.
The spirits are angry with me,
for leaving you.
Maybe they didn't want to me to have my powers again.
I had all those dreams for a reason.
The spirits wanted me to find you,
because you're my mom.
It's not them.
It's you.
You won't open yourself up to it.
Do you know dad never talked about you?
And neither did grams.
I had no memories of you.
So you know what I used to pretend?
That you were dead.
It was...easier to do that
than to wonder...
why you never came back for me.
There's no way I can tell you
how sorry I am for what I did.
Yes, there is.
You can help me.
It almost worked.
I have to call Damon.
Tell him we're getting closer.
I'll be right back.
Ok.
So why don't we move this evening along
and discuss the terms of this proposal?
Well, that's very simple.
Klaus gets his coffin back.
In exchange,
he, and the original extended family,
leave Mystic Falls forever.
Me, Stefan and Elena live happily ever after,
No grudges.
Deal sounds fair, brother.
I don't think you understand.
Elena's doppelganger blood
ensures that I will always have more hybrids
to fight those that oppose me.
I will never leave her behind.
Let's say I do leave her here,
under your protection. What then?
How long before one of you turns her into a vampire?
Or worse.
How long before she dies, caught between your feuding?
You see,
each one of you truly believes
that you're the one that can protect her.
And that is simply a delusion.
Gentlemen...
The worst thing for Elena Gilbert is...
the two of you.
I'm going to get some air.
Let me deal with this.
All this talk has made me thirsty.
What do you say, Stefan?
Can I interest you
in a little after dinner drink?
Thanks for walking me home.
Are you doing ok?
This has to bring up a lot for you.
We've all lost a lot.
It's this town.
It's messed up.
None of us should have to live this way.
That's weird.
The electricity must be out.
Here.
I think I have some candles over there.
Oh, my god!
What the hell?
Ric! Oh, my god! Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god!
Elena, leave it, he's lost too much blood!
I'm going to call 911.
Ric, look at me.
Who did this to you?
I don't know.
Oh, my god! There's a lot of blood, Matt!
I know! I know, Elena, I know.
You have to kill me.
What?
Elena, you--
you have to kill me.
Wait, wait, wait, Matt, hang up.
Hang up. He's right.
If he dies a supernatural death,
then he'll come to life and he'll be healed.
But how do you know who did this is supernatural?
That's what he's saying! We don't, but...
I'm a doppelganger.
That makes me... supernatural.
Elena, no! This is messed up!
He's dying, Matt!
Mmm. Delicious.
Aged to perfection.
Well, I guess the only reason
you agreed to this evening, Klaus,
is to drive a wedge between me and my brother.
Oh, no, you're doing that well enough on your own.
Because of Elena, you're going to lose your brother,
and you'll only have yourself to blame.
What do you say, Klaus?
It's time for you to put something on the table.
We've made our offer.
Now you counter.
Ok.
I offer Elena's future happiness.
You see, what she needs right now
is to be rid of you lot,
and to fall in love with a human.
Maybe that nice football player,
you know, the blonde one.
Matt Donovan? Really?
Yeah, why not?
They'll marry, live a long and fruitful life,
and pop out a perfect family.
And continue the Petrova bloodline.
Every few hundred years,
you'll have a new doppelganger to drain
and never run out of hybrids.
Right, Klaus?
Consider it a small return on my investment in her well-being.
See, after you hand me back the coffin,
I'll ensure her safety for the rest of her natural life.
You know it's what's best for her.
So...
What do you say, Stefan?
Do we have a deal?
What are you doing?
Nice try, Klaus.
But no deal.
What are you doing?!
Stop!
Now bring me my coffin
before I burn him alive.
I'll get it.
Go with him, brother.
You keep him honest.
When you return, I will make good on my promise to you
and I will hand over our family.
Your first state regionals.
Yep. And I was afraid to join the squad.
And you talked me into it.
You had nothing to be afraid of.
You were so much better than all those other girls.
How are you feeling?
I'm tired.
Can I get you anything?
Or... do you want me to call Steven?
No, no, we haven't spoken in a while.
Just...call him when it's over
and the dust has settled, would you?
Yeah.
Listen. Listen to me. Ok?
I know that you think you made your choice.
But you can change your mind, you know?
You are strong enough to handle being a vampire.
I mean, you're the strongest person that I know.
No, Caroline, my strength is all in my beliefs.
Becoming a vampire is wrong.
People aren't supposed to cheat death.
It's just...what I believe.
Please respect that.
How can you hate who I am so much?
No, no, no, sweetheart, I don't hate you.
I love you.
You're strong. You're beautiful.
You're good.
No, I'm not.
And even after everything that's happened to you,
you are exactly who your mother and I hoped you'd grow up to be.
Then please don't leave me, daddy.
Please...please don't leave me!
Daddy, just don't leave me.
Parents aren't supposed to outlive their children, Caroline.
It's ok.
This is life.
This is what it means to be human.
Go ahead, kill me.
I know you'll do it when he brings the coffin.
You really have given up, haven't you, huh?
Where's the fight? Where's the ripper?!
Elijah.
Why haven't you left?
Well, where are your manners, brother?
You forgot dessert.
What have you done?
What have you done?
See, I've learned not
to trust your vulgar promises, Klaus.
We're doing this on my terms now.
Kol.
Long time, brother.
Finn, don't!
Rebekah!
This is for our mother.
You're free to go.
This is family business.
He's still out?
Caroline called.
Her dad died.
Will you stay with me?
Until he wakes up?
Of course.
I can't lose any more family.
Well, you were right about Elijah.
Undaggering him was a smart move.
Wow, actual acknowledgment of a job well done.
You going soft, Stefan?
So I guess I shouldn't thank you
for saving me from Klaus.
Shut up.
You don't get to thank me till I pay you back
for all of those times you saved me.
You could have left me there.
Klaus would have killed me
and you would have had Elena all to yourself.
I didn't do that on your account.
I love her, Damon.
So do I.
I looked into it, Elena.
Meredith Fell was called into surgery six hours ago.
She's been in there ever since.
She has an alibi?
Iron tight.
An operating room full of witnesses.
Then who could it be?
I don't know.
But the attack on Alaric makes
this the third member of the founder's council,
and we just cleared our only suspect.
Let's hope big witch and little watch got that coffin open.
Something's got to make this night worthwhile.
Bonnie?!
She's still breathing.
Mama's still breathing, I can hear her.
Coffin's open.
Well, it's not going to do us any good.
Whatever's in it's gone.
I like what you've done with the new place, Nik.
I wanted it to be for all of us.
A place we could all call home;
a place we could all be a family.
None of us would ever have to be alone again.
You're right.
None of us will be.
You're staying behind.
We're leaving you, Nik.
Right after I kill that doppelganger wench.
And you will be alone.
Always and forever.
You run.
I will hunt all of you down.
And then you'll become everything you hate.
Our father.
I'm the hybrid!
I can't be killed!
I have nothing to fear from any of you!
You will when we have that coffin.
Mother?
Look at me.
Do you know why I'm here?
You're here to kill me.
Niklaus, you are my son.
And I am here to forgive you.
