You know how a computer is this big?
What if a computer was... this big?
The size of a man's hand.
And it had a camera in it and you could take self pictures
and it also had a phone?
So you could store it easily...
It's kind of a good idea.
Draw it up by noon.
Quit bossing me around.
This makes me impatient
and it makes me also so furious...
I need 45 minutes away from you,
and then we can be best friends again.
Don't follow me out.
今日
So, as you guys know, Schmidt and I are business partners.
We've been working on an idea we're very excited about.
We e-mailed our plans to a guy in China,
and the prototype is here.
And... we've got a pitch meeting set up
with Lori Greiner.
From QVC?
That the one.
That's right.
You know, Fawn and I were paired with her
in a charity golf tournament.
You know, they laughed at me for playing the ladies' tees,
but it paid off.
She's a shark.
A shark golfing.
Now I'd buy that T-shirt.
Friends, imagine yourself in this scenario.
You're at the local gymnasia.
You're schvitzing up a storm.
Suddenly, you get a text message.
There's an emergency wedding down at the town hall.
But what'll I wear? I mean, I'm sweating at the gym.
Huh, I don't know what's going on. I love this.
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present to you...
Game time.
The Swuit!
The Swuit!
The Swuit!
The Swuit!
It's a suit made entirely of sweat suit material.
Well?
This is it?
What do you guys think?
This looks like garbage. It looks like garbage.
I don't think it looks like... relax.
Nick, it looks like garb...
It's embarrassing. Put it away.
The bottoms aren't great, but the top...
Well, I like it.
I mean, I like you guys.
All right, I'm gonna go throw this out.
No, don't throw it away!
Why, you want to wear it?
No.
No, no, no, no.
No.
He said, "Do you want to wear it?"
No, I just...
I think... I was gonna put it
in the Goodwill bin at school.
As lining for the bottom.
Get rid of it. It's a piece of crap.
We're-we're screwed.
Guys, you're starting a business.
There are gonna be some setbacks.
We don't have enough time, okay?
I'm running out of vacation days,
and our pitch meeting with Lori is on Friday.
Friday?!
You never told me Friday.
He never told...
I told you a hundred times it was on Friday.
Guys...
That sounds like it could be right, yeah.
Could be Friday. Yeah.
Now we need another good idea in four days.
Ah, I can't work under pressure like this.
You know that I get nervous.
I am just a man. I am not a God.
Uh, I think we're all aware of that.
Why you talking like that?
Like what?
Well, we're all aware of that.
Guys, stop fighting!
You're upsetting Winston.
It's so early.
You made me swallow my night guard.
Oh, please, it's a paperclip with gum wrapped around it.
We're in a crunch.
Good morning!
Made you guys some brain food.
Ah, thank you.
I'm supposed to hang out with Kai later
and do nothing. This'll help.
No time. The pitch is on Friday.
I'm gonna need one good idea
every 20 seconds.
Oh, you're gonna time me now?
Yes.
It'll help you concentrate.
It's too beepy-boppy.
Well, it's brain music.
Go.
Look away.
This is exciting.
I feel like I'm in the garage at Cupertino.
乔布斯和合伙人也是在车库里发家的
This sounds like the video in middle school
that taught me about periods.
And time!
All right.
Let's see what you got.
"I am the Karduthian champion of... of dance."
"Beer bread."
Beard bread.
Bread that is in your beard.
That's an... that's an invention?
Or is that just something that happens to you?
You think Hewlett had to put up with this crap
from Packard? Again.
Oh, now I'm Packard? Enough!
You can't come up with a good idea being all loosey-goosey.
Why don't you tell that to Howard Hughes,
是个将神话与怪异集结一身的天才人物
the inventor of the Loose Goose?
That was the Spruce Goose, and it didn't work!
It did work!
It flew for over a mile at an altitude of 72 feet!
How on Earth do you know that information
and not know the name of it?
I don't want to stick my nose in someone else's rose,
but what I'm hearing
is two very passionate partners
with two totally different approaches.
You hit the nail right on the head!
That is a correct assessment
of what is going on right now.
And thank you for breakfast!
I'm gonna shove this bacon right in my mouth
and savor it for life.
That omelette was so delicious!
You know what, you guys are saying really nice things to me,
but you're both shouting...
Such a delicious omelette!
The presentation's fantastic!
One of the most delicious things I've ever had.
You've outdone yourself.
Definitely appreciated!
Don't follow me.
Don't follow me!
All they care about is who's the boss.
Of course that's all they care about, Jess.
It's a guy thing. It's in our DNA.
Look, Nick's not gonna let Schmidt boss him around,
and vice versa.
Don't get me started on the male power dynamic.
I will talk your ear off.
They're being such dudes right now.
It's, like, all about
who's got the bigger you-know-what.
Oh, I do know what.
What can we do to make them collaborate?
You can eliminate their you-know-whats.
That was a joke.
You want to hang out tonight and have ninja turtle sex?
What's ninja turtle sex?
Sex with backpacks on.
Oh, sex with backpacks on!
Yes, I would love to, but I can't.
I got to do some work, or Schmidt will put me
in the "Think Harder" box,
which is basically just a refrigerator box
that he hits with a baseball bat.
Gets me to think harder.
Talk later?
Yeah.
Great.
I really hope that you enjoyed your service today,
and please come back...
Okay.
Thanks a lot, big spender.
You should probably show some clavicle.
No. I need bigger tips.
They're raising my college tuition,
and if I don't come up with the money by Friday,
I got to drop out.
So I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Wow, Cece, look.
I mean, we're your friends.
If you want, I can give you money.
You can give her money.
I ain't giving her a damn thing...
I think what Coach is trying to say
is that he will also give you money.
Look, that's very sweet,
but the last thing I want is charity, okay?
And don't tell Jess, because she just
goes nuts anytime she thinks I need money.
So I don't think I can afford to go home for my aunt's birthday.
You need money? I'm selling my hair!
Oh! Hi. Hello!
You're a handsome fella.
Can I interest you in a drink or...
Oh, you suck!
We got to do something.
Winston, for the first time in my life,
I'm not 100% broke,
and you want me to give my money away?
No, sir.
She said she didn't want charity.
I ain't giving it to her.
Oh, crap.
Am I stuck doing another thing with you again?
It's a classic Winston and Coach mess-around!
All right. But don't say that.
What if I put your name first?
Let me hear it.
It's a classic
Coach and Winston mess-around.
Regardless, I don't like it.
Oh, okay.
Hey, Schmidt.
So I noticed you're having trouble working with Nick.
Well, you know what, he's got a real head
full of dog dirt.
So I noticed you're having trouble working with Schmidt.
He's a bossy old tuna.
Well, we both know you are the boss.
Thank you.
But we both know he's not the boss.
Exactly.
Maybe you could back off a little,
since Nick's been having, you know,
man problems.
"Man problems"?
Man problems.
Are we talking clog or leak?
He's got the wet Tuesdays?
You think it's 'cause of his tight denim pants?
Did the squirrels get to the tulip bulbs?
And that's why you have to make him
feel like he's the boss right now.
Yeah, of course. It's the least that I could do.
Well, I had no idea Schmidt had a cranky dank.
So, yeah, I'll let him be the boss.
I'm amazing.
What?
I'm amazing.
What?
What?
What?
This is a bit of an unprecedented group,
the three of us.
This isn't a social call, young lady.
Oh. This is strictly business.
Here's the deal.
You need money for college.
No. No, okay?
I am not a charity case.
This isn't charity.
No. No, we've gone through this.
This is an investment.
Nick and Schmidt are looking for investors,
so we thought it would be fun if we got into investing, too.
You're smart, you're driven.
We are confident in a very robust ROI.
ROI means "Return On Investment."
I know what it stands for.
I've been reading a lot
of Schmidt's investment books in the toilet.
Lifehack, the toilet paper makes for
a very, very handy bookmark.
Lifehack, read your phone
on the toilet like everybody else.
The answer is gonna be no, all right?
Because when you borrow money from friends,
things get weird...
N-N-No, do not mistake this
for friendship, young lady, all right?
As far as I'm concerned, you're just a walking treasury bond.
Within three years of graduation,
you will pay us back in full,
plus ten percent of the principal.
I really don't want to do this. At all.
But...
There's always a "But," Huh?
But I don't really have any other choice.
Yes!
You were right, man.
So I guess we're in business, boys.
Yes.
We wrote the check out to Cece.
We do not know your full name.
This is looking really good.
It's absolutely stunning.
This is... this is your vision from start to finish.
I might be the seed, but you're the farmer.
Hey, you two look like you're really getting along.
Yeah, well, you know what, who wouldn't get along
with this brave, masculine, healthy cowboy?
What you got there?
It's a camera attachment.
That keeps the attention of your dog
while you're taking its picture.
Oh. Schmidt came up with a great title for it.
It's called "Perfect Pet Pic."
This is just a prototype that dumb-old me came up with.
If he put it together, it'd be a lot better, I promise you that.
Now, of course, could-could you just hold some pet food
in your other hand? Sure.
But this is a lifestyle product.
That's actually really impressive.
I think Lori's gonna like that.
You know, I had a vision of what this product would look like.
And you carried it out and exceeded my expectations
in a way that... I don't know.
It-it's touching.
Sometimes I feel like you're my arms.
I'm really proud of the way that you're handling this.
I'm proud of the way that you've handled this.
What have I handled?
Y-Your man problems.
No, honey, you're the one with the man problems.
I don't have the man problems. I'm being so nice to you
because you're the one who has the man problems.
No, no, no, sweetheart, I'm only being nice to you
'cause you have man problems, and I feel sorry...
No, you have man problems
and that's why I'm being nice to you right now.
Honey, honey, honey...
What man problems did you think I had?
Something hangy.
Hang...? You think I had something hanging off...
What'd you think I had?!
I don't want to get too graphic,
but I... I was picturing something gooey.
Gooey's not the worst-- I've had gooey.
Oh, good God, what?
Simply ignore it.
Who told you about my man problems?
Who told you about my man...?
Look, the only reason why I did this
was to get you guys to stop arguing about who's the boss...
Don't you be sorry!
Jess, you did nothing wrong!
You're nothing but an angel!
You tried to help us, which is a sweet move!
You tried to help a situation...
You're yelling nice things at me again!
...which was at a boiling point.
It's very confusing!
This is his fault!
He's been bossing me around for ten years!
If I hadn't been bossing you around,
you would just be a bartender with a lot of ideas
and the ambition of a dead person.
I will never let you boss me around again.
Not even if the lives of 100,000 children depended on it.
Fine, if-if... I take that part back.
If a bunch of kids' lives depended on it,
I'd let you boss me around.
You went way too far
in that moment.
Fine, but you understand my point.
If there were five kids whose life
depended on it,
I wouldn...
Not even five kids.
Okay, I... No kids, I don't...
pretend I...
Just take the kids out.
I understand the point you're trying to make!
The company is dead! That's the point.
I'm going to that pitch meeting tomorrow
with Lori Greiner without you.
You know why?
Because a boss never breaks appointments.
You think I was born in the middle of the afternoon?
You're gonna go into that pitch and take all the credit?
Fine, go to that pitch together, and then me and you, we're done.
Fine, I'm done with you.
Don't speak to me until bedtime.
If you think we're gonna have a bedtime chat,
you're out of your mind.
We'll lay in beds, and we'll just over the day together
like we usually do and that's it!
No.
Fine, we'll do that for a little bit. That's it.
That's it.
Here, take it. I don't even need it anymore.
Bedtime chat's gonna be so short, you won't believe it.
Oh, I'll believe it.
You won't believe it.
Thought you might not show.
I drove you here, Nicholas.
Let's just get through this thing,
and then we can be done with each other, okay?
Okay.
And, by the way, stay out of my way in there.
I'm about to blow the roof off of this thing
with a little something I like to call the "Seven S's."
I bet you don't have any more than four.
Yeah? Watch me.
Go ahead.
Strategy, sizzle, Schmidt,
sex...
Go on.
Stop interrupting me. I got... I got more.
Salesmanship.
Something.
Synergy.
Boom. Nailed it.
Damn it.
That's seven-- how you like me now?
All right, that's really good, but it's not gonna matter,
'cause the only thing that matters is what I have.
A prototype.
So stay out of my way in there,
and let me just show her the prototype,
because that's all we need.
We don't need a prototype.
Did you forget the prototype?
No.
Did you forget the prototype?
No.
Did you forget the prototype?
Yeah.
Where'd you leave it, Nick?
I still believe in them though.
Part of me thinks that even though
they're mad at each other, they'll get in there,
and they'll figure it out.
I don't think that's the case.
Why are you being so negative?
'Cause they left their stupid thing.
What?!
Oh, crap.
♪ I'm delivering a prototype ♪
♪ And drinking a big coffee... ♪
Oh, crap.
Nick, what is the matter with you?
Well, I wouldn't have forgot it if you didn't bully me
to get out of the house an hour early!
It was too fast! I needed time!
You lay on the ground...!
You guys ready?
Yeah.
Yes, of course.
Absolutely.
I'm talking about postwar.
That's after the war.
Prewar would be something different completely.
I was in London postwar, post-postwar,
in '77, and, uh...
I caught a few shows.
The flights were...
Well, I think I spent two... maybe $250 to get to...
Guess who?
What are you doing here?
I'm just checking in on my investment.
Oh, my...
Hey, check it out.
I'm a campus cutie.
No, you are not.
What are we learning?
I am studying
Postwar British Art History.
What? Post Br-British who? What's that?
That's just a bunch of words that mean
"Screw you, investors." What else you taking?
Intro to Afrikaans.
What else? Astronomy 101?
That's next semester.
What you gonna do, Cece,
join the South African space program
and be the first woman
to put a David Hockney painting on the moon?
Who is David Hockney?
Excuse me, can I help you?
No, no, we're okay, sorry.
Yes, can you please, um,
tell my investment here
We're okay, we're...
that she can't make any money with art history.
That's not true.
Last year I made almost $22,000,
and my life is very hard.
You see that? You should be studying to become a doctor.
They make good money, they get respect.
Paging Dr. Cece.
A doctor? We wouldn't see a penny
for at least 12 years.
Here's what you should be focused on, okay?
Something with a low risk,
high reward, and that thing...
Do not say hotel management.
Hotel management.
Oh, my gosh.
Look, man, it is a secure living
and it's great way to meet people.
Do you mind...
telling me where I might find more information
on hotel management?
Uh, the dog, uh... the dog...
You put the food in the thing.
Uh, and then the dog sees it,
and, uh, the food's dangle-dang...
uh, it's dangling.
To, uh, do-do-do...
Dog...
Looks at dang-dang.
Tail wag-wag, uh, rev...
dog wagging the ta...
Um, whatever dog's name is.
Dog's name is Claire.
Claire come in.
Who-who's Claire?
Shh.
Uh, Claire sees dog food.
Pic, Facebook, like, like, like...
Sizzle...
Pet Pic...
strategy, sex, something.
Strategy, sex, something.
S-Something.
Something.
This is the worst pitch I have ever seen.
Sorry. Sorry to interrupt.
Gentlemen, your prototype.
Wait, what are you wearing?
This?
This is the Swuit!
It's a suit
made entirely of sweat suit material.
It was invented by Nick and Schmidt,
and like them, it's the perfect combination.
That one over there,
he's all creativity and ideas.
Thoughts and notions.
And this one's all data and numbers.
Six.
He can just keep going.
The Swuit goes from day to night and night to play.
Take my friend Nick here for example.
I mean, this is a man who would wear sweatpants to his wedding.
I now pronounce me comfortable.
Look, Lori, you get it.
Look, Lori, you get it.
Lori, you get it.
Do it together.
No one doesn't love the Swuit.
Don't settle for substitutes.
Swettle for swub-si-swuits.
No?
I've got to stop drinking on the golf course.
To the Swuit!
The Swuit!
Hey, how'd it go?
She like the Perfect Pet Pic?
Even better.
She hated the Swuit.
Yeah, she's got a similar product on QVC
called the Scruit.
It's a suit made of scrubs.
It was developed for prison weddings.
Yeah, paid us $10,000 to kill the Swuit.
Yeah!
Yeah!
So, Nick, are you finally free to do nothing?
Not so fast there, lady.
Uh, old Schmidty-bangs and I
have to get working on our next idea.
That is, if you'll still have me, buddy.
Come on, man.
Of course I'll have you.
Look at me.
Look at me.
I was looking at you the whole time.
Don't say anything.
When I say that, just let me say that
and take a moment where you're like,
"Wow, he's about to say something."
You kept... you kept saying it as if I wasn't looking at you.
But what I'm clearly doing
is saying, "Look at me."
And what you're supposed to do is be like, "Ah."
And then I'm gonna say something.
Look at...
L-Let me say it first.
All right, guess what? Gone.
Now. We back?
Of course, man.
Come here.
Ah, come on.
Come on.
Come on, come here.
Come on.
Come here.
Come here.
Just meet in the middle.
Dynamic duo.
Dynamic duo. Batman and Robin.
Yeah, I'm Batman.
I'm Batman, for sure.
You guys just made ten grand.
What are we doing drinking booze that you didn't buy?
Let's go.
Yeah!
Let's do it, all right! Yeah!
Hey, can we talk for a minute?
Yeah, sure.
Wow, that is some serious shade.
I guess we deserve that.
Yep. Cece, look,
I know I got carried away with the whole investing thing.
So...
I'm sorry.
Ooh, an Afrikaans dictionary.
Yeah, it was not easy to find.
Read the inside cover.
"Whatever drawings you talk about,
always shoot for the stars.
Winston and Coach."
It's very sweet, guys. Thank you.
That makes zero sense.
I know, it makes no sense.
Nick Miller,
friend, businessman.
This one's for you.
What is she doing now?
I think she's making herself some tea.
What's up? Are you okay?
Kai broke up with me.
No.
I'm sorry, dude.
I'm sorry. What happened?
She said she wants to be
with somebody who can just sit on the couch all day.
She said I'm too ambitious, she said I work too hard.
Nah, it was the...It's not funny.
It's just that when you said that out loud, it made me laugh.
I'm really sorry about Kai.
She seemed like a great girl, but on the bright side,
in all your years on this planet,
has anyone ever dumped you for working too hard?
No.
No, it's mostly 'cause I'm either too poor or too sticky.
So this is a big day then.
For the first time in my life,
I really want to do something with this, you know?
I really want to make this business work.
Schmidt, tomorrow, let's start bright and early, 7:00 a.m.
No, no, no, Nick, I want to do it your way.
Let's wake up at 12:00 noon.
Just said your way.
Hey, guys, how about 9:30?
Now that's a genius right there.
9:30, let's say 9:30. Let's meet in the middle.
What's that book?
Oh, nothing, it's not even a...
General artifact.
They're giving out books at the bar now for kids.
What is it, seriously?
It's mine.
Winston and Coach gave it to me.
They're helping me with money for my tuition.
You need money?
No, it's gonna be fine. Jess...
Oh, my God, I'm selling my car.
No, Jess, no, look, it's gonna be...
It's gonna be fine, okay?
I guess we have to listen to this whole song.
Not a fan.
Kill me, please.
The worst.
*Taking care of business*
*Taking care of business*
*Taking care of business*
*Taking care of business*
*And working overtime, work out!*
Hey, guys, we're in a bar. We're not in the loft!
You're right, you're right, calm down.
