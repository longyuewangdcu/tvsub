why are you shaking your head , mr. gross ?
i don &apos;t know , the usual reasons :
disbelief , incredulity , disappointment .
ah , i must be endangering the future .
no , just being a bit melodramatic .
so , you never tweaked the algorithm ?
chummie the squirrel just acts on his own ?
no , i didn &apos;t say that .
but you said you couldn &apos;t impact the results .
yes , but the algorithm needs
almost daily attention and , uh , revision .
i see . and why would you revise it ?
for one thing , to avoid spam .
spammers are constantly trying to game the search results .
so we adapt the algorithm to avoid that .
deena lampard .
it should only take a minute more .
i recognize you both from the trial .
you work for neil gross &apos;s law firm ?
yes . he hates you guys .
may i ask you ... why are you here ?
good question .
why are we here , dad ?
i &apos;d rather wait for the lawyer .
she &apos;s a lawyer , just like me .
my dad likes male lawyers .
my daughter likes acting like i &apos;m not in the room .
mr. lampard , hello .
ms. lampard .
i &apos;m david lee , family law .
i see you &apos;ve met alicia and kalinda .
how may we help you today ?
here , help yourself .
thank you , no .
uh , well , let &apos;s see .
uh , my daughter needs a second opinion .
regarding ?
okay . what is it ?
it &apos;s a prenup .
i see .
and who is your daughter intending on marrying ?
neil gross .
neil gross , president of chumhum ?
yes .
the ninth richest man in america .
yes .
who gave you your first opinion , deena ?
you said you wanted a second .
longcraine &amp; church .
mr. gross &apos;s law firm .
yes , and my firm . they thought i should sign it .
yes , of course they did .
we &apos;re middle @-@ class people , mr. lee .
we don &apos;t have much money .
and deena is paying off her student loans .
dad , it &apos;s not about that .
i know . but i want you protected .
well , that &apos;s why we &apos;re here :
to protect you .
it &apos;s a travesty .
if they divorce , she gets nothing
and she has to immolate herself
on an altar of chumhum &apos;s choosing .
there &apos;s no contingency here ?
no , but she &apos;s marrying the ninth richest man in the country .
we do right by her , we get the business .
gross will never bring his business here .
he &apos;s made that clear .
no , her business .
we write this up correctly ,
and we &apos;ll get some kind of bill &amp; melinda gates charity in her name .
she &apos;ll bring it here .
is that what she wants ?
she &apos;s 28 . she doesn &apos;t know what she wants .
she &apos;s in love .
well , not to put too fine a point on this ,
but , time &apos;s up in bankruptcy court
and we &apos;re only halfway to the $ 60 million we need .
if we want to argue for an extension ,
we need to show the court some progress .
well , the fiancé of the ninth richest man is progress .
i &apos;m doing my job .
you two do yours .
alicia , do you mind ?
could you close the door ?
why don &apos;t you go ahead and sit .
if this is about the extension work , it &apos;s ready .
no , no , no , we &apos;re ... we &apos;re fine .
sorry to be so melodramatic , but , um ...
do you want to ?
no , go ahead .
jonas stern , about a lifetime ago ,
sat me down in a room , not unlike this one ,
and offered me a cigar .
i said no , of course .
but then he said the following--
unfortunately , i can &apos;t do his voice .
thank god .
anyway , he said ,
&quot; after i tell you what i &apos;m about to tell you ,
&quot; i want you to go home , take your phone off the hook
&quot; and sit for a moment .
&quot; and feel proud of yourself .
&quot; and then i want you to go out and get drunk .
&quot; or do something you would never do :
&quot; buy a sports car , go sailing ,
go to the track . &quot;
i did go to the track , by the way .
i went windsurfing ... unsuccessfully .
anyway , this moment is your moment , alicia .
we want you to join us as an equity partner .
oh , my god .
yes , what you &apos;ve done here is extraordinary .
you &apos;re ...
you &apos;re kidding .
no .
we want you to join the ranks of our highest echelon .
i ... i don &apos;t know what to say .
say you &apos;re happy .
i &apos;m happy .
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m relieved .
you don &apos;t know what a roller coaster this has been .
and for the firm as well .
oh , i thought this would take years .
it &apos;s a credit to you , alicia .
you &apos;ve been amazing here .
anyway , think about it .
no need to rush into it .
take until the end of the week , and then say yes or no .
does anyone ever say no ?
i don &apos;t know . i can &apos;t remember
the last time we sat an associate down .
well , i &apos;m not going to say no .
well , give yourself until the end of the week .
and good luck with this mrs. gross case .
sounds promising .
thank you .
thank you so much .
ouch .
alicia , are you heading to bankruptcy ?
what ? i don &apos;t think so .
is everything all right ?
yes .
we have cut our debt in half , your honor .
in five months ,
we have gone from owing $ 60 million
to owing now only 30 .
29.5 .
that is the difficulty here , your honor .
we have a trustee who thinks of us as a decimal point .
okay , thank you .
mr. gardner , ms. lockhart ,
you &apos;re looking for another five @-@ month extension ?
not another five @-@ month extension ;
a single five @-@ month extension .
but yes .
mr. hayden , tell me why i shouldn &apos;t
extend this fairly arbitrary deadline .
well , i didn &apos;t think of it as arbitrary .
and i would like the creditor to advance
his own argument .
mr. canning .
your honor , hello .
i &apos;m louis canning .
i , uh , would like to thank you for ...
taking the time to listen to me today .
i &apos;ve been in other courtrooms
where the voice of the handicapped is often shunted aside and ignored .
but not here .
that &apos;s the great thing about america .
dear god .
these movements that you see
are called tardive dyskinesia .
your honor , excuse me . relevance .
ms. lockhart , please .
i think we can tolerate this purely as an explanation .
thank you , your honor .
i would argue against this extension
for one simple reason :
the money that i collect from lockhart / gardner
will go directly to neurological research into syndromes like my own .
so , every day payment is delayed
is another day that a child
wakes up without a future .
your honor , mr. canning should be
rejoicing in our resurgence .
if we &apos;re liquidated today , he &apos;ll only
receive 50 cents on the dollar .
in five months , he &apos;ll get his full 100 % .
that &apos;s only if the debt is repaid in full .
yes , which is why we intend to present evidence
showing our obligations can be fulfilled
in five months time .
i agree .
please have your arguments ready by tomorrow .
look who &apos;s working together .
i just want to ask god for one thing ...
... be true , let our minds be clear .
and as we discuss these candidates ...
there .
what there ? there &apos;s nothing there .
everyone &apos;s head is bowed except for maddie &apos;s .
come on , this is not the south .
doesn &apos;t have to be the south for it to resonate .
voters don &apos;t like radicals .
they don &apos;t like rudeness .
that is rudeness ,
and it plays downstate .
eli , is peter here ?
oh , no , we had to send him downstate
at the last minute . what do you need ?
ms. florrick , hello .
hello .
could you have him call me when he gets in ?
sure . is everything all right ?
yes .
alicia , uh , could i ask you a quick question ?
when you were friends with maddie hayward ,
did you ever talk about religion ?
did we ever talk about religion ?
belief in god .
what &apos;d she say ? she an agnostic ?
oh , i don &apos;t know if i feel comfortable with this , eli .
oh , she &apos;s used stuff you told her
in confidence against peter .
yes , but i ...
she &apos;s an atheist .
she told you that ?
it &apos;s not that weird , eli .
oh , i know . i &apos;m not saying anything .
but she told you she was an atheist ?
yes . why ?
no reason .
i &apos;ll tell peter you came by .
ah , there you are .
i was wondering where you wandered off to .
just went on a lunch break ,
and bought a few things .
how nice for you .
deena signed on .
gross and his lawyers are coming over tomorrow
to start negotiating .
good .
and another thing-- i heard
will and diane sat you down and had the talk .
congratulations . good news .
thank you .
it was unexpected .
yes , well , now , here &apos;s the thing :
they might not have talked to you
about the capital contribution .
it &apos;s required of all equity partners .
$ 600,000 .
and i know that sounds like a lot of money ,
but we have reasonable terms .
usually 50 % up front
and another 50 deliverable upon bonuses .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry . what ?
the capital contribution .
it &apos;s your investment in the firm .
every equity partner has to throw into the pot .
that means you &apos;re invested in the firm ,
the firm &apos;s invested in you .
sorry ... $ 600,000 ?
yes , i know .
it sounds like a lot of money .
my god , when i was a fourth @-@ year ,
it sounded like all the money in the world .
but you only need to put up half .
the other , with interest ,
is usually payable within three bonus cycles ,
maybe more , depending on how we &apos;re doing .
so ...
any questions ?
six ... hundred ... thousand ?
yes , membership has its privileges ,
but first , you need to be a member .
any other questions ?
i ...
no .
good .
again , congratulations .
kalinda , just give us a month . that &apos;s all .
no . thanks , though .
we &apos;re cash @-@ poor at the moment .
if this bankruptcy extension goes our way , we won &apos;t be .
it &apos;s good . but , in the meantime ,
i was promised a promotion and a five percent increase .
you really think this is going to work ?
excuse me ?
look , nothing your firm does in that room
is going to convince me to hire you .
mr. gross , maybe you didn &apos;t notice ,
i &apos;m in a meeting .
you are not gonna get my business ,
and if you do anything to come between me and deena ...
i &apos;m in litigation , not family law .
i didn &apos;t solicit your wife &apos;s business ,
nor am i involved in her negotiation .
so get the hell out of my office .
you got your raise .
keep track of that .
happy to .
ah , here &apos;s the groom .
can we start now ? is everybody happy ?
ecstatic .
are you okay with this ?
we just need to go through the motions .
yeah . i know it makes sense .
i just ... i want you to be comfortable , baby .
deena , why don &apos;t you have a seat here ?
no , no , babe , sit here .
i &apos;m okay here .
we just have a few amendments to make
to the fine work done by your firm , rochelle .
we would suggest
redrafting pages two through ,
let &apos;s see ... 68 .
we &apos;re fine with the cover sheet .
we wanted to redraft anyway--
we feel like mr. gross is being far too lenient financially .
our first concern is jurisdiction--
texas ?
mr. gross has a ranch outside of austin .
and chumhum &apos;s technical support facility is there .
but mr. gross isn &apos;t-- he hasn &apos;t been there
since the two @-@ hour stopover at dfw en route to paris , march 2009 .
that &apos;s not dispositive .
but this is .
the couple will be domiciled in mountain view , california ,
which is the location of chumhum &apos;s headquarters .
california law is friendlier
to the more dependent spouse .
texas is not so friendly .
actually , mrs. florrick , why don &apos;t you tell her
the real reason you want california law
it &apos;s the seven @-@ day rule .
what &apos;s the seven @-@ day rule ?
both parties must have
the final agreement in hand for seven days before signing .
or it &apos;s unenforceable .
the prenup is voided .
our wedding &apos;s in nine days .
exactly . so we have 48 hours to hammer this out .
then let &apos;s make a deal .
48 hours-- god made plants and animals in 48 hours .
they are trying to hold a gun to our head , deena .
it &apos;s a gun to both of our heads .
it &apos;s equal pressure on both parties .
yes , but which party suffers
if the prenup is altered ?
both parties suffer , given that mr. gross
and deena want a mutually satisfactory agreement .
we don &apos;t have the time to hammer it out .
we &apos;re here to represent ...
this is absolutely ridiculous .
mr. connolly . yes .
$ 600,000 . i know .
the question is : can i borrow against my mortgage ?
a cosigner
who &apos;s the cosigner ?
oh . no , i forgot .
mr. florrick .
look !
look , this is academic .
we are never going to get a divorce .
&apos;course not .
no , we share your optimism ,
but this contract is about worst @-@ case scenarios .
if texas law governs ...
it &apos;s okay .
texas law is fine .
let &apos;s just move on .
perfect . shall we move on to spousal support and maintenance ?
uh , yes ,
but , uh , it &apos;s almost noon .
why don &apos;t we pick up after lunch .
that concession was damaging .
we can &apos;t afford any more giveaways .
david , she &apos;s a woman in love--
it &apos;s gonna be hard to motivate her .
do you need dirt ?
yes .
but that &apos;s the challenge about prenups-- you need
to throw enough dirt on the spouse to get something ,
but not too much to kill the wedding .
i &apos;ll be delicate .
lyman nordquist .
i am the ceo of loc pharmaceuticals .
is that loud enough ?
it is . thank you for speaking up .
so you funded mr. canning &apos;s trust , ansanil equity .
the one that purchased all of our firm &apos;s debt .
is that correct ?
yes it is .
now , help me out here .
why would a billion dollar conglomerate
want to control the debt of a chicago law firm ?
i renew my objection to this witness , your honor .
a creditor &apos;s motive is not relevant ;
only his debt is .
mr. canning is the one who brought up motive ,
your honor , by suggesting this debt
was for afflicted children .
are @-@ are you all right , mr. canning ?
i am now , sir , yes .
mr. gardner , you &apos;re arguing that the creditor
has a biased motive for resisting your extension ?
yes , clearly .
well , then , unfortunately , mr. canning ,
i have to overrule you .
so , mr. nordquist ,
why fund the purchase of our debt ?
mr. nordquist ,
i must compel you to answer .
lockhart / gardner brings
costly nuisance suits against us .
ah ... so this isn &apos;t about handicapped children .
there is nothing either illegal or unethical in our actions .
but mr. canning would never support an extension of our debt deadline ,
even if it was one week .
objection . beyond the scope .
that &apos;s all right .
i think it &apos;s clear why mr. canning doesn &apos;t want our extension .
what was that ?
what was ... mr. nordquist ?
he &apos;s the money who wants what we both want .
&quot; we &quot; ?
when did we become a &quot; we &quot; ?
you &apos;re right ; i &apos;m being presumptuous .
lockhart / gardner is a good firm
with good people who are being mismanaged .
now , if you agree with that , then we are a &quot; we . &quot;
i &apos;m not here to destroy it .
i know .
you &apos;re here to make sure the firm &apos;s creditor--
myself-- gets paid ,
and to put a good firm on firmer footing .
that &apos;s what i want , too .
you intend to be a lawyer , mr. hayden .
is that right ?
yes . why ?
have you passed the bar ?
i take it next week .
illinois .
that &apos;s a tough exam .
struggled with that one myself .
what do you intend to do afterward ?
practice the law . why ?
we should talk .
you &apos;re kidding .
congratulations .
thank you .
i &apos;m ... stunned . i wasn &apos;t expecting it .
i was ; just not so soon .
this is one for the history books .
fourth year .
how much is the catch ?
well , the capital contribution is $ 600,000 .
wow .
yeah .
but i can borrow against the mortgage .
i just need you to cosign .
why cosign ? i &apos;ll loan it to you .
you ...
no , peter , i haven &apos;t even decided if i &apos;m gonna do it .
why wouldn &apos;t you ?
well ... the firm , its situation .
i think i want to see where things fall .
okay . well , that &apos;s smart ,
but when you decide , i &apos;m fronting you the money .
it &apos;s a business decision , alicia .
it &apos;s like taking out stock , nothing else .
thank you . that means a lot to me .
hey , alicia .
hi .
i &apos;m jordan .
i know .
you walk fast .
i &apos;m in a hurry .
just need a minute with the god question .
the god question ? uh , the question of belief .
what do you believe ?
uh , i believe your father was politely anglican
and your mother was politely nothing .
am i being too personal ?
you &apos;re being something .
we &apos;re making an issue of
maddie hayward &apos;s religious beliefs ,
which means she &apos;s gonna make an issue of yours .
and how is she gonna do that ?
at the leadership forum tomorrow ,
we have a surrogate who &apos;ll hit her with the atheism thing ,
so you may be asked , too .
so , if you don &apos;t mind , what do you believe ?
okay . we &apos;ll talk later .
go ahead , cary .
you &apos;re the one who discovered it .
uh , actually , kalinda did .
actually , i don &apos;t care . someone tell them .
the shares of chumhum
that neil gross offered you in the prenup ,
they &apos;ll be worthless if you divorce .
why ? what do you mean ?
the prenup has no non @-@ dilution clause .
meaning that if the shares aren &apos;t fixed at a percentage of the company &apos;s value ,
neil can keep issuing more stocks and more stocks ,
and poof , millions become pennies .
i don &apos;t care .
deena , i think you should listen .
no , dad .
neil and i had lunch .
we &apos;re ready to put this stuff behind us .
in my professional opinion ...
i have made my decision .
i won &apos;t let money guide me .
please shut it down , mr. lee .
thank you .
we &apos;re not shutting anything down .
she just needs a good dose of reality .
she said she won &apos;t let money guide her .
yeah .
so don &apos;t go after money .
okay .
good .
we &apos;ll make sure gross and his lawyers
give her a good dose of reality .
gross and his lawyers ?
live and learn ,
young protégé , live and learn .
ms. lockhart ,
the $ 30 million you raised ,
does that include the firm &apos;s take on the 16 cases you settled ?
yes .
in the previous ten years ,
what percentage of litigation
did you settle rather than bring to verdict ?
objection . only the firm &apos;s conduct since bankruptcy
is relevant here .
overruled .
ms. lockhart ?
i wouldn &apos;t know offhand .
i would .
less than 30 % .
yet , since the firm declared bankruptcy ,
it &apos;s settled 100 % of its cases .
objection ! attorney is testifying .
here &apos;s some testifying ; they &apos;re reducing
the debt on the backs of their clients .
your honor ...
it &apos;s immoral . it &apos;s unethical .
excuse me , your honor . mr. canning has not ...
if he wants a war , he &apos;s got one .
diane ... no . we &apos;re not gonna let a mercenary
like canning get away with smearing
our reputation like that !
the thing is , we may have exposure here .
will ...
we have never sold out a client .
never once .
i agree . but if he has evidence
contradicting your testimony ...
what evidence ?
the spence west nile case .
we wanted $ 15 million ; we dropped our ask to 12 .
for a very good reason .
we needed the money .
no .
that was a good settlement .
and if he puts someone on the stand who contradicts us ?
someone who will tell the truth , even if it hurts ?
who ?
alicia .
yes ?
you &apos;ve been subpoenaed .
we give up .
really ?
that &apos;s a first .
my client is amenable to mr. gross &apos;s positions
on all financial issues .
great .
we should do this more often with the clients out of the room .
my office will prepare the paperwork ,
and we &apos;ll get it to you , yes ?
actually , there is just one thing .
i thought it was too easy .
ms. lampard would like the document to address
a number of personal cohabitation expectations .
within reason , we &apos;ll listen . what are they ?
relationship maintenance .
ms. lampard requests a date night each week ,
preferably on fridays ,
to last no less than four hours door to door .
consecutive hours ?
yes .
and also mr. gross is required to spend 600 minutes
away from work each week .
inclusive of the date ?
no . in addition .
that could be problematic .
we &apos;re open to negotiation .
children .
ms. lampard insists
that any children will be brought up christian .
no , deal breaker .
mr. gross is jewish .
oh , come on .
we made movement on the money .
can &apos;t give on religion . what else are you after ?
sexual maintenance .
number of times a week ?
yes .
we can horse @-@ trade on that .
good .
i thought we were shutting this down .
we were .
we tried . they asked for some additional items .
cary , why don &apos;t you ?
mr. gross wants you to stipulate
that your children will be raised jewish .
what ?
yes .
we were surprised .
we never discussed religion .
not once .
his lawyers also insisted
on a few relationship bullet points .
sexual maintenance .
at least twice a week ,
though mr. gross reserves the sole discretion for more or less .
he asked for that ?
his lawyers did .
look , when you said stand down ,
his lawyers pressed their advantage .
that &apos;s the problem with standing down .
we can push back , deena ,
or you can just sign this prenup and hope for the best ,
but i would push back if i were you .
push back .
push back hard .
nicely played , cary .
thank you , sir .
you &apos;re gonna make a hell of an equity partner .
now , you two get moving on gross &apos;s asset assessment .
they offered you partnership ?
uh , i know , it &apos;s funny , right ?
me , too .
yeah ?
i was wondering if they did .
congratulations .
i think they were counting my years before i left ,
not just the last seven months .
yeah , you &apos;re probably right .
so ...
congratulations , partner .
alicia ?
do you have a moment ?
any idea why you were subpoenaed ?
no .
we were wondering if it was about the west nile case .
canning faced you on that .
maybe .
well , the recession has worsened this past year .
even clients with good cases have had cash flow issues .
meaning the percentage of cases we &apos;ve settled has increased .
which leads to the absurd suggestion
that we pushed our clients to settle so we could get paid .
we just want to make sure we &apos;re all on the same page
with our testimony .
i think so .
good .
good . that &apos;s all .
oh , and did you go out and do something special ?
celebrate ?
yes , i did .
so , where are you on belief in god ?
what ?
it &apos;s for the campaign .
yes , i know .
your friend , jordan , already asked me .
he was here ?
no , at the campaign bus .
oh . what did you say ?
i said it &apos;s personal .
for him , right ? but not for us .
great .
thought so . do you have a minute ?
so , that &apos;s almost a belief in god .
how is that almost a belief in god ?
i have a husband who believes in god
and a daughter who might ...
yes .
and what about zach ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i don &apos;t .
but the point is
you could believe in god .
but i don &apos;t .
yes , but if jesus were to show up in your office right now ,
you &apos;d believe in him , wouldn &apos;t you ?
no .
yes , you would-- if he performed a miracle .
well , if jesus walked into my office
right now and performed a miracle , then yes ,
i would believe in god .
good . see ?
you &apos;re a seeker .
alicia , i know this sounds stupid ,
but voters hate atheists .
they think they spend all their time fighting mangers outside city hall .
they want people who are open @-@ minded ,
and you are open @-@ minded .
okay , is that what you want me to say ?
i want you
to be saint alicia .
it &apos;s a selling point for peter ,
and voters don &apos;t want to think saint alicia &apos;s an atheist .
okay .
so diane and will negotiated in good faith ,
cary is as deserving as i am ,
and god might exist .
i &apos;m good .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what that was about , but ...
yes !
jordan ...
what did you think of him ?
he &apos;s ...
awkward .
he is , isn &apos;t he ?
not a bad thing to mention to peter .
okay .
just one scripted line per day , please .
right , okay . i &apos;m out of here .
oh , my god .
well , if he &apos;s not going to do it ,
at least memorialize his intent !
he &apos;s not memorializing anything .
except outrageous personal demands .
david , this is not an ipo , it &apos;s a prenup .
what , do you think i &apos;m an idiot ?
of course it &apos;s not .
the point is my daughter is entitled to protection .
you shouldn &apos;t even be in the room .
please do not talk
to my client &apos;s father .
my god , this is so silly !
deena , i &apos;m not gonna dilute your stock options .
and when did you start worrying about stock options ?
wait a minute , when did you ?
i &apos;m talking to my fiance .
look , this is contract language , baby , that &apos;s all .
it &apos;s about precedent .
if i give you more ,
then every future contract will ask for more .
you mean every future prenup after you divorce me .
you know what , that &apos;s it .
we &apos;re done .
that &apos;s fine , neil .
you never loved me .
all you wanted me to do was spread my legs twice a week
and breed your children .
okay , okay ,
everybody sit down .
would you go after her ?
the point is you love him .
don &apos;t you love him ?
but everything he &apos;s done-- the stock options ...
but you said you don &apos;t care about the money .
i don &apos;t , he does . that &apos;s the point .
it &apos;s not what i care about , it &apos;s what he cares about .
you know what i think , deena ?
i think you should go to him .
no .
yes . just call him ,
say you want to have dinner ,
no lawyers in the room .
all of this was moving too fast .
the more neil spends time with you ,
the less he &apos;ll care about the money , i promise you that .
and we &apos;re the ones who are pushing the money .
you two ,
you need to pull each other past it .
hello , mrs. florrick .
hello , mr. canning .
we recently faced each other
in a case involving the west nile virus , didn &apos;t we ?
we did . good to see you again .
and you .
seems we all made it back okay .
my client settled that , didn &apos;t he ?
he did .
$ 12 million dollars .
and to your knowledge , was the decision by your firm
to settle that case driven at all
by its need to raise capital ?
it was driven by our client &apos;s desire
to avoid protracted litigation .
so that would be a no ?
that would be a categorical no .
a categorical no ?
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s a really big no .
the biggest .
and to your knowledge , has your firm ever settled any case
in the past five months with the reduction of its debt
as a consideration ?
no .
mrs. florrick ,
did you meet with mr. gardner
and miss lockhart in preparation
for your testimony here today ?
objection .
i &apos;ll allow .
yes ,
but only to discuss my responsibility
to answer your questions truthfully .
mrs. florrick , are you aware of any schemes
perpetrated by your firm to reduce its debt ?
objection as to vagueness .
i &apos;m quite certain mrs. florrick knows
what &quot; scheme &quot; means .
i &apos;ll allow .
i &apos;m aware of no such scheme .
you were recently offered a partnership
at lockhart / gardner , is that right ?
yes .
and how much will that cost you ?
objection ! relevance .
overruled .
my buy @-@ in to the firm
is $ 600,000 .
you &apos;re a fourth @-@ year associate , is that right ?
correct .
does it seem odd to you
that a fourth @-@ year associate should be offered a partnership ?
yes .
and isn &apos;t it odder still
that five associates at lockhart / gardner ,
all fourth @-@ year associates , should be offered partnerships ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . you weren &apos;t aware .
five associates at lockhart / gardner
were offered partnerships .
is that your question ?
did i know that ?
for a start , sure .
no , i did not know that .
and were you aware that your firm
is trying to raise millions of dollars to pay off its debt
by naming five partners ?
objection ! asked and answered .
sustained .
there &apos;s no scheme , mr. canning .
unless you consider the promotion of someone
who has billed thousands of hours
and helped win dozens of cases a scheme .
i have nothing further .
mr. gardner ?
witness may step down .
alicia , there you are .
you look fantastic .
thanks .
you okay ?
is everything ... ?
good , yeah , great .
just let me know when you want me
to say i believe in god , eli .
uh , okay ,
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s quite the way to handle this .
alicia , i think we should become friends .
why ?
political wives tend to like me .
i keep them in the loop .
do you believe in god ?
do i believe in god ?
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t know . why ?
that seems to be the question du jour .
i believe in rainbows and little kids &apos; smiles .
that help ?
hi , maddie .
alicia , it &apos;s been a long time .
yep .
you have any new friends ?
just so you know , alicia ,
i didn &apos;t break off our friendship ,
and if you could let go of this victimhood pose
that you &apos;re hanging on to ...
you know what you can do with your vic ...
hey , there you are .
hello , peter . how are you ?
good .
looking like one debate , i see .
looks like it .
everything okay here ?
just grand , darling .
you know , i would love to get you in the bathroom and ...
mr. state &apos;s attorney , hello .
any reservations about sharing the spotlight
with miss hayward in another campaign event ?
none at all .
and by the way , this is not a campaign event .
i &apos;m here to honor the 20th anniversary
of the leadership forum .
it &apos;s a campaign event .
miss hayward , how do you respond
to the controversy over your actions
at last week &apos;s benediction ?
my actions ?
you mean the video on the web of me not bowing ?
yes , during prayer .
there &apos;s been some chatter
about your insensitivity .
well , i apologize if it seemed insensitive .
i was just trying to avoid being hypocritical .
i am an atheist .
really ?
don &apos;t you worry about how that will play
in a state where only 15 % call themselves nonreligious ?
i worry about everything , um , but i am who i am ,
and i don &apos;t think you should run away from that .
let &apos;s just let the voters decide .
and what about you , mr. state &apos;s attorney ?
i respect maddie &apos;s point of view .
but you don &apos;t share it ?
well , it &apos;s different .
i was in prison .
belief means a great deal there .
in fact , sometimes it was the only thing we had .
and your wife ?
oh , well , i ...
i think my wife can speak for herself .
i &apos;m an atheist .
nothing in chumhum &apos;s 2011.10 @-@ k , either .
check the footnotes .
accountants , they hide problems in their footnotes .
footnotes .
i heard that you were offered partnership .
yeah .
me , alicia and three others .
well , congratulations .
what ?
they need the money .
they &apos;re just handing out partnerships like popsicles .
popsicles ?
i don &apos;t know ; it &apos;s late .
so , you going to take it ?
the popsicle ?
if i can get the draw together , sure .
oh , you just feel sorry for yourself
because you were offered something .
hey .
what ?
check out the 2010 expenditures .
the footnote , under &quot; miscellaneous , &quot; there .
you see the off @-@ balance @-@ sheet joint venture for $ 112,000 ?
it &apos;s in the 2009.10 @-@ k , too .
well , there &apos;s your dirt .
i &apos;ll tell david lee .
mr. hayden ?
cary .
may i help you ?
no , uh ...
i don &apos;t know .
no , i ... i ...
no .
are you sure ?
i don &apos;t like mess ; i like precision .
i know .
this is mess , and i &apos;m not sure how to handle it .
what is ... what is mess ?
this , this ... business with louis canning .
hey , you have the bar exam this week , don &apos;t you ?
yes , i do .
good luck .
thank you .
but i don &apos;t know , i &apos;ve come to not like the law .
it &apos;s not very precise .
it can be ; it just depends on the way you practice it .
you &apos;re right .
it can be .
mr. hayden ...
i &apos;m sorry .
about before , testifying the way i did ,
against you , in that bankruptcy mediation , i just ...
why ? it was the truth .
i &apos;ve been subpoenaed in court .
i appreciate that we &apos;re all back at the table .
mazel tov .
but i &apos;m not sure what the point is ,
if he &apos;s not willing to negotiate .
maybe you could ease up on some of your demands .
mmm . deena , mr. lampard ,
would you mind stepping out a moment ?
why ?
believe me , sir ,
it &apos;s in your daughter &apos;s best interest .
i don &apos;t mind .
don &apos;t get lonely .
i won &apos;t .
okay , what have you got ?
i was reviewing chumhum &apos;s sec filings ,
and there &apos;s a recurring joint venture expense ,
hidden in a footnote , for $ 112,000 .
i take exception to the adjective &quot; hidden . &quot;
a valuation challenge for 100 grand ?
david , seriously .
the joint venture
is a rhode island llc called jc partners .
and its one beneficiary is jacob carlisle .
that &apos;s the four @-@ year @-@ old son of dara carlisle ,
the woman that mr. gross had a one @-@ night stand with ,
in greensboro in 2008 at a shareholders &apos; meeting .
so what &apos;s the threat ? cough up the money ,
or you &apos;ll tell your client ?
we don &apos;t know . we thought we &apos;d discuss it .
extortion ? not even you would sink that low .
sure i would .
i &apos;m going to call the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
you &apos;re going to forfeit your license .
rochelle , just stop .
neil , no .
that &apos;s ... this ...
i &apos;ll give ...
give them what they want .
isn &apos;t that sweet ?
young love .
so , mr. hayden ...
you probably had the best available view
of all the shenanigans at lockhart / gardner ...
objection .
as to shenanigans ...
i &apos;ll rephrase .
you had the best view
of all the goings @-@ on at lockhart / gardner ?
well ... i was the trustee .
were you aware of the decision
to offer partnerships to five associates ?
yes .
and were you in agreement with that business decision ?
mr. hayden ?
i was not .
financial commitments to partners
are one of the causes
of the firm &apos;s bankruptcy .
minting new partners is not a solution .
they were doing it to raise money .
objection .
sustained .
let me try it this way :
if each of those new partners met
their capital contribution obligation ,
how much money would lockhart &amp; gardner raise ?
$ 3 million .
so , if allocated towards repayment of the debt ,
it would give the illusion of financial progress , right ?
yes .
so the large number of offers can only
be explained as a ... as a pyramid scheme .
wait , no , no , strike that .
in this context , how would you characterize
the offer of employment in exchange for money ?
your description , while crude , is apt .
it &apos;s a type of pyramid scheme .
and isn &apos;t a job being dangled
in this quid pro quo sort of way ... extraordinary ?
no , i &apos;m afraid not .
it &apos;s not ? why is it not ?
well ... just the other day ,
you offered me employment in exchange ...
let &apos;s move on .
objection .
let the witness answer .
the answer is irrelevant .
the answer was incomplete .
when it is complete , the judge can decide if it &apos;s relevant .
ms. lockhart , please let me do my job .
go ahead and complete your answer , mr. hayden .
i was saying , just the other day ,
you offered me employment , mr. canning ,
in exchange for continued help in these proceedings .
move to strike as nonresponsive .
overruled .
i think it was perfectly responsive .
under oath , sir ,
did i ever make an offer of employment to you ,
contingent upon your assistance in this hearing ?
no , but the clear import was that ...
no further questions .
what , exactly , did mr. canning offer you ?
he intimated there would be a job for me at his law firm
when these proceedings were over .
and , uh , just prior to that intimation ,
did he ask you for assistance in this matter ?
yes .
he requested detailed information about cases .
thank you , mr. hayden .
you &apos;re welcome .
five @-@ month extension .
that gives us breathing room .
and mrs. gross is thinking about assigning us
her entire midwest book of business .
the tide is turning .
the vultures from real estate are hoovering up all the shrimp .
mr. gardner , ms. lockhart .
mr. hayden .
we don &apos;t know what to say ... except thank you .
though i confess i don &apos;t understand your motivation .
well , i don &apos;t agree with how you run your business ,
but you paid me the compliment of not assuming i was for sale .
good luck with the bar next week .
thank you .
it has been interesting here .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ll miss it , but i &apos;ll ...
no , i won &apos;t miss it .
and they ate and drank and made merry .
all save poor little cinderella ,
who toiled amidst the reverie .
mr. canning ,
i thought you &apos;d be off somewhere , licking your wounds .
i &apos;m a quick healer .
no , i just came by to sign the extension .
mr. canning , you &apos;re not here to sign any extension .
you know what the best thing about monopoly is ?
the &quot; get out of jail free &quot; card .
i used to love hoarding that card
&apos;cause you never knew when you might need it .
mr. canning , please .
i hate these stories .
whatever it is you need to say , just say it .
i don &apos;t need the story .
this ...
is your &quot; get out of jail free &quot; card .
what did he want ?
mr. canning ?
it was a personal matter . nothing important .
well , i &apos;m here on a professional one .
your absence from the festivities
is sending quite a message to the partnership .
uh , what message would that be ?
that you &apos;re not vested in our little enterprise .
you &apos;re pouting .
it &apos;s unbecoming .
no .
i &apos;m working .
you know why i was made partner ?
jonas stern was sued for sexual harassment ,
and he needed to show that he had a female partner .
that &apos;s all .
when the door that you have been knocking at
finally swings open ,
you don &apos;t ask why ; you run through .
that is the simple fact .
no one is here to make it comfortable for you ;
no one is here to appreciate your moping ,
so this is my advice to you :
take a minute for yourself ,
put on your best gracious voice ,
find a way to wear a smile ,
and then come into the conference room
ready to thank the equity partners
for giving you this opportunity .
because what is given can quickly be taken away .
thank you , will .
thank you , david ,
for giving me this great opportunity to become a partner .
i won &apos;t disappoint you .
we know you won &apos;t . you &apos;re welcome .
just you remember one thing :
it &apos;s all about client maintenance .
thank you , diane , for thinking of me for this position .
i won &apos;t disappoint you .
good .
well , you haven &apos;t in the past ,
and we know you won &apos;t in the future .
