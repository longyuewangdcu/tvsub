Criminal Minds S05E14
Lorraine.
There you are.
I'm sorry that I'm late.
I was about to call you.
I should know better than to keep a beautiful woman waiting.
Oh laying it on thick aren't you?
Oh I've been looking forward to this.
Got a prospectus for you.
Food first.
Do you like crab louie?
I do.
It is so good here.
They use stone crab fresh from the bay.
The filet is wonderful
if you're in the mood for meat or the osso bucco.
Henry.
Hello.
Sorry. Um...My head is still at work
making sure I deposited a check for a client.
Well I'm a client too.
And you're on my time now.
You have my full attention.
I better.
I have something you want.
This is all you have on him?
We have the back of his head from a few cctv angles
nothing that helps.
He's careful to avoid being seen on camera.
Out of all my cases this guy was never flagged
as top priority
But this murder changes everything.
You were right to call us.
We'll explain why.
Everyone this is agent Russell Goldman
from the San Diego white collar team.
You've already met agent Hotchner.
These are agents Rossi Morgan
Prentiss and Reid.
A pleasure.
So we're working a white collar case?
Not exactly.
I've been following a con artist for 5 years.
Two nights ago I think he killed someone.
Carla Marshall of miami was found dead in her home.
Asphyxiation by strangulation.
She also had trauma wounds to the head.
Why do we think the con man killed her?
Last week Carla contacted a fraud website
to report a scam. The complaint ended up
on Goldman's desk.
We spoke on the phone at length.
Her story matched my guy to the "t."
She planned on confronting him that night.
I told her to cease all communications
and wait for me
I'd fly to Miami and set up a sting.
But that never happened.
Do you have physical evidence
confirming it's your guy?
No but for her to be murdered the night that we spoke
I don't think it was a coincidence.
There was no sign of forced entry theft
or sexual assault.
And judging from the M.O. the motive was personal.
What's his hustle?
Investment fraud.
Basically he's a smaller Madoff.
To give you an idea of how convincing he is
this is a sampling of his work going back 14 years.
He's prolific.
He's scammed hundreds of thousands
of dollars from people but he's never been violent before.
Con men usually don't murder
but when they do
it's to conceal their crimes.
Con man's a nice name for these guys.
They profile as psychopaths.
They see their cons as theater and themselves
as a sort of puppeteer.
They have to have absolute control
over their victims and their cons.
Maybe that's why he starting killing
because he lost control?
The question is how out of control is he?
Well if he's spiraling
he's a danger to everyone around him.
And because he's so charming
the victims never see it coming.
Who do I make it out to?
Grant Dale investments inc.
Hunter Portland advisors incorporated.
Henry Moffet hedge funds incorporated.
Henry Moffet...
Hedge funds...
Inc.
This is a lot of money.
It'll be the best decision of your life.
"If I am what I have "
"and if I lose what I have "
"Who then am I?"
German psychologist Erich Fromm.
I can't believe you guys have your own jet.
We take turns piloting. You want to give her a try?
Really?
No.
What kind of forensic countermeasures does he use
to hide his trail?
Fake I.D.S disposable phones
Prepaid credit cards foreign bank accounts.
You can't track his accounts overseas?
We can but it takes months to get the records
and it only takes him seconds
to transfer money again and again.
By the time you figure out it's in the Bahamas
he's already moved it to Switzerland or somewhere else.
I've always been too far behind him.
Well we're a lot closer now
because of Carla.
What made her suspicious in the first place?
She needed to get her father into a retirement home
and when she called this guy Grant Dale
to free up her money
He never returned her phone calls.
A con man's first instinct is flight
not fight.
What makes him kill though isn't financial
it's psychological.
That's what we need to concentrate on
why Carla and why now?
Morgan and Prentiss go to her house.
Agent Goldman why don't you join them.
I sent his case files to the field office.
Shouldn't I stay with you and help you sift through them?
I'd like to go through them independently
come up with our own theories
see if any behavioral patterns emerge
that'll help us get ahead of him.
Agent Goldman's files are in that room down the hall.
Thank you.
Let me know if you need anything.
Thank you.
You're kidding me.
We have to go through all of this?
White collar cases often come down to a paper trail.
Maybe it won't be so bad.
I mean at least it's well organized.
That's his job.
He sits at a desk all day
And accumulates paper evidence.
All right. Dave you work victimology.
Reid see if you can find anything in his travel patterns.
She was a real estate agent.
She was doing well for herself until William came into her life.
Why do you call him that?
He introduced himself as Bill Billy
or Will
Several times in his early cons.
My guess is that his real name
May be some form of William.
So most of his victims were very wealthy right?
You should see some of their mansions.
Well I'm looking around this house and it's nice
But no mansion.
She didn't invest as much as his other clients either.
I wonder why he targeted her.
She may have been useful to him in some other way.
Hey Goldman.
What was the alias he was using with Carla?
Grant Dale.
Come check this out.
He set up a website.
Why didn't the detectives find this before?
The locals wouldn't know to look for it.
Well it's only one page.
Generic investment information.
I mean there's no contacts there's no picture of himself.
No just photos of nice cars and houses.
So he's selling the fantasy of success.
His web design is pretty basic.
I mean it's like a standard template.
It would be fairly easy to set up.
Maybe he created others.
I'm gonna call Garcia.
Hey baby girl it's me.
You're on speaker.
Oh sug I don't care who hears it.
It's always been you.
Listen I just emailed you a link.
Got it.
It's the unsub's website.
Do you want me to find out how he paid
For his hosting services track him down that way?
We'll run into the same backstopping trail.
Oh you are right. that's untraceable.
All right we'll forget that.
Can you do a search for websites
Containing the same content?
And searching... and searching...
There are 1.2-- 9 identical websites
Same written content same pictures
Just different names.
These are all new aliases.
And he's never had 10 at once.
This is all new.
I'm Henry Moffet.
You lied to me about everything.
What are you talking about?
Your name is not Grant Dale.
God why are you doing this to me?
Just calm down. listen to me.
No just leave.
You're not giving me a chance to explain.
Leave or I'll call the police!
Grant...
Grant...
Grant...
I'm Henry Moffet.
Henry Moffet.
The CIA assigns an agent 2 or 3 aliases at most.
Any more than that
And it's difficult to keep the names straight.
This guy's juggling 10.
Being all these people that's gotta start fracturing him somehow.
If his memory is strained it could be causing him to lose control.
We have the current aliases.
We just need to know who the clients are.
Got Carla's phone records.
She made several calls to an unknown number the night she died.
I tracked the number.
It was a disposable phone
That hasn't been used since.
That's gotta be the unsub's number.
He tossed it after he killed her.
Over the past few months
She routinely called this number really late at night.
How late?
Like bedtime late.
You don't do business with your investment manager at bedtime
So when are we gonna do this again?
My husband's coming home so...
I won't see you for a while.
I'll miss you...
You lied to me Grant.
About everything.
Leave or I'll call the police!
Grant are you ok?
Henry are you ok?
I'm gonna miss you too.
So Carla never mentioned anything about an affair with him?
No but it's always been a challenge with fraud victims
to be totally forthcoming.
They're so embarrassed about being duped
They don't tell you everything.
Detective Goldman.
We'd like to compare notes.
Shoot.
I'm looking at the victimology.
We say affinity groups. Same thing.
It refers to victims with shared interests.
Ok. we're in your world we'll use your terms.
Your files point to specific affinity groups he targeted
in the first few cities.
Does this look accurate to you?
Yes it does.
Once he got beyond San Diego
his victims are all over the place. No shared interests.
I came to the same conclusions.
So he stopped using affinity groups
And found his victims somewhere else.
Where I don't know.
That's where we start.
I'm randy. Randy.
Randy.
I'm randy summerland.
I'm randy summerland.
Make us some money ok?
I can do that.
Now how do I spell your name again?
M-o-f-f-e-t.
Henry moffet hedge funds incorporated.
Who is henry moffet?
Randy...
Who is henry moffet?
It's my partner.
You didn't mention anything about a partner.
I didn't?
And this isn't who I made the check out to last time.
He's been my partner for years.
Then why am I making the check out to him?
There's a simple explanation.
So the unsub and the vic are having drinks.
The vic has a checkbook and pen out
Check's dated but that's it.
The unsub got that close to getting his money
Somehow failed and then did this.
And this is overkill.
He bashed his head in.
He's completely unhinged and devolving fast.
Only he doesn't know that.
He's still trying to go to work
And he doesn't know he's in danger of losing it at any minute.
Like a functioning alcoholic.
The unsub channels all of his energy into these cons
And when the con falls apart
This is how he handles it.
How long have you known randy?
We spent a lot of time with him
In the last couple of months.
He was helping us invest.
How much money did you give to him?
He just kept saying we needed to be aggressive in this market.
Oh my god
This is all my fault.
What do you mean?
I met randy.
I brought this man into our lives.
Mrs. Mckelson
Is there anything more to your relationship with randy?
We're gonna find out eventually.
Find out what?
Randy wasn't who he said he was.
Randy wasn't even his real name.
What?
We think this man is using his looks and his charm
To target women.
So there's others.
I laid in bed next to the man
Who killed my husband.
Did they have transgressions?
She's pretty beat up over it.
Randy who is henry moffet?
Daddy?
You're home!
Hey good morning buddy.
let me look at you.
You're a handsome devil you know that?
I missed you.
I missed you too.
Bill when did you get in?
Just now.
How was your trip?
It didn't really pan out.
Sorry. What happened?
Can we uh talk about this after j. D. Goes to school?
I want pancakes.
Really? You do?
Well then pancakes you shall have.
You're not enjoying this are you?
I like a good paper trail. I find it meditative.
Is it really that hard for you to be normal just one time?
He just burned another alias.
You know if this guy's on a mission
To eliminate all these aliases
He's gonna systematically assassinate his victims.
Carla lived in miami.
This victim frank mckelson lived north in ft. Lauderdale.
The victims could be anywhere in south florida.
If he's working harder because of the economy
It makes sense that he would expand his operating zone.
Prentiss and rossi are on their way back. We need to give the profile.
There's something else about san diego.
I noticed in his earlier crimes he only stays in each city
An average of 14 to 18 months.
Then he's in san diego for 3.1/2 years
And then never in the same city for that long again.
All right so what is it about san diego that made him stay longer?
Keep following that reid. See where it takes us.
Are you sure?
I wouldn't be doing this if we didn't have to.
J.D. Was just starting to make new friends.
What do you want me to do? The money has dried up here.
Maybe you could take a break
Spend more time with j.D.
Ok then how am I supposed to raise a family
If I don't have enough clients?
Baby I hate seeing you so stressed out.
All right now this economy is killing me.
I can get a job too.
No. No I can take care of us myself.
Well we have to figure something out because I don't want to move again.
Listen we are moving to boston.
End of discussion.
Honey what happened?
Now start packing.
This unsub is a white collar con man
Who embodies what behaviorists call the dark triad--
Narcissism
Machiavellianism
And aberrant self-promotion.
What that means is that everything revolves around this guy.
He manipulates and exploits others using dishonest tactics
And he's become a menace to society.
Hunter.
Hunter.
Hunter.
I'm hunter portland.
He's also what we call a casanova con man.
He seduces women to get to their money.
It's standard behavior for him
To have casual sex with multiple partners
And then use that as a weapon
to accomplish his goals.
We have his sketch.
And here on the board are his aliases.
He frequents high-end venues--
Country clubs hotel bars and membership-only establishments.
And notify the banks.
He's constantly moving money
Opening and closing bank accounts.
He's active in miami and ft. Lauderdale
But he could be in other wealthy communities too.
Look at places like boca raton
Or coral gables.
He has too many aliases in his head right now
And it's causing him to fracture mentally.
And it's this loss of control
That triggers his violence and makes him dangerous to be around.
And any additional stress
Will make him more likely to attack.
I don't have to go this long without seeing you.
I could fly to wherever you are.
you would just distract me.
We'd just be spending all day in bed together.
My husband's gone for a week.
Why don't you stay tonight?
Um...I--I can't gorgeous.
I got to deposit your check in the bank before the market closes.
Do you think that we could be happy together?
What?
I could leave my husband.
Um...Slow down.
Hunter. Hunter not now.
I gotta--I gotta take this.
Hello?
Don't be mad at me but I want my check back.
What?
I got another call. Uh don't go anywhere.
No--
Bill--
Yes I'm here.
I need you to pick up j.D. From tod's
And drop him off at piano.
No I can't.
My car broke down. Help me out here.
Fine.
Hello.
Henry I'm really sorry I just--
I don't want to move forward.
Look I can guarantee your money.
Why what do you mean?
Well I don't do this for just anybody
But since it's you I can uh protect you from any risk.
I'll pick you up in a little bit and we'll talk about it ok?
Ok henry.
Hunter?
I need you to listen to me.
Ok.
I'm pregnant.
It's yours.
Grant dale.
Bill.
Agent jareau said you have something.
I spoke to his victims.
Before san diego they described him
As driving exotic sports cars.
After san diego they described him as driving
Larger sedans and suvs. Before san diego
He lived in condos referred to them as bachelor pads.
After san diego spoke of living in gated communities
With large yards.
What forces a man to stay put in one place for a while
Downgrade his car upgrade his house?
You think he has a family?
These are lifestyle changes a new dad would make.
Why would he start a family?
Because he wants to appear normal
And a family does that for a psychopath.
Wives usually serve a purpose
As a caretaker or homemaker.
They value their offspring
As an extension of themselves
And it also feeds their narcissistic ego.
These are interesting theories
But how does this help us?
As a forensic countermeasure
Con men put everything in their wives' names.
Bank accounts cars homes.
And if his wife isn't complicit in his crimes
She'll still be using her real name.
If we find the wife
We can find the unsub.
Thank you for the drink
And for guaranteeing my money.
It's all gonna work out.
I just got scared.
I understand.
You pressed the wrong button.
Dad?
Daddy?
Hey that's me.
Can I talk to you about something?
Yeah of course buddy.
Do we have to move again?
I like it here.
You know I'm really disappointed in you.
Sorry.
I'm really disappointed because you didn't say something sooner.
You know if you want something in life
As a man you need to ask for it.
Now let that be a lesson.
Ok.
So you really like it here huh big guy?
Yeah.
Well I think I may have found a way
For us to stay for a while.
Serious?
yeah.
I just need to dump my client list and start over.
So we can stay?
I'd do anything for you kiddo.
What is that?
Just hang out here for a sec all right?
Watch your video.
What is it?
Spare tire came loose.
Don't worry.
I'm fixing it.
Massive blunt force trauma to the head
Same as the others.
Does it make sense for him to dump her like this?
He's killed 2 people in 2 days.
His fracturing is intensifying.
When a criminal devolves like this
They're capable of anything.
Jj said a man reported his wife missing last night.
Description matches the body. Name's lorraine horton.
Do we know anything about her investment history?
The team's looking into it right now.
Ok so he killed his first victim in miami and then left town
Came to ft. Lauderdale killed his second victim here
But he didn't leave town for his third.
Is there a significance to him staying in ft. Lauderdale?
Guys what if his family lives here?
That's why he's trying to eliminate threats to himself here
'cause this is his home where he needs to protect his identity.
Hey garcia.
Em I feel like I've been sent on a wild snipe hunt.
Do you have any idea how many women in south florida
Lease luxury cars and rent mansions?
I will answer. Too many. That's how many.
Ok narrow the search down to ft. Lauderdale only.
Look at women who moved here 8 to 12 months ago
See if any of them have any history with san diego.
Ok. I'll call you back when I find the elusive snipe creature.
This is gonna be good for us.
I don't understand.
I thought you would be happy.
Just yesterday you were hell-bent on moving us immediately.
Yeah and then you and j.D. Both said you wanted to stay
So I found a way to make it happen.
How?
I just did.
What is going on with you?
You know what?
I thought I was doing you a favor.
I don't have time for this.
Good afternoon.
I'm stuart. You asked for the bank manager?
Agents rossi and jareau fbi.
We need some information on a client named lorraine horton.
Is ms. Horton ok?
Can you check her recent banking activities
See if there's anything unusual?
Maybe a check written to a person's corporation.
I know she recently came into more money.
Her mother passed. They sold the house
And she got a pretty good sum for it.
She sold a house?
Yes sir.
Wasn't the first victim in real estate?
We've been asking ourselves
How he finds his victims now.
We just found out lorraine got a large windfall
From selling her mother's house.
Carla marshall the first victim
Was in real estate.
When you sell a house your property becomes public record.
Your name goes on these lists.
Lists compiled by lead brokers
And sold to the real estate companies.
Hey pen.
Oh man it is raining snipe all up in here.
Did you know that your boat owners frank and dina mckelson
Sold a house in hawaii about 8 months ago?
Do any of them have a direct connection to carla marshall?
Ah carla generated these letters
Advertising the swanky beachfront condos
Her company sells-- stay with me--
Lorraine horton the lady who was murdered this morning
Her address along with the mckelsons' address
Are buried in a spreadsheet in carla's laptop.
That's how the unsub found his victims.
He used carla to get her leads.
That's why he targeted her.
She gave him access to a list of people
With a large amount of liquid assets.
We need that list.
Already flying to you.
But that is not all folks.
I think I may have found the wife.
I did a search on women who've lived in ft. Lauderdale
For the last 8 to 12 months
Who rent houses and cars and have a history in san diego.
Came up with about a dozen names but...
Ooh la la only one of them works in real estate.
Who?
Her name's rebecca hodges. She has a 9-year-old son
John davison hodges born in san diego
Father on birth certificate
Listed as william hodges.
William.
I got the address of the house she's renting too.
Let's head over there. Morgan pull the son out of school.
Jj and reid go over the list of potential victims.
If anybody knows the unsub send units to them.
Ok so I'm gonna go deal with this client.
Will you call me later?
Yeah I will.
Did you forget something?
Are you a client of bill's?
Who?
Don't do that. I saw him leaving here.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You should leave.
I saw you with my husband.
Do you know we have a son?
His name is j.D.
You didn't know bill was married?
I didn't know his name was bill.
Again this is agent jareau.
It's very important that you call me back.
Thank you.
Thank you. Yeah thanks so much.
I just confirmed another potential victim. I sent a unit over.
I can't get ahold of this one couple
Hector and brooke sanchez.
Hurry up.
Dad where are we going?
We're going to get mom. It's a surprise.
What kind of surprise?
We're going to boston.
But you said yesterday--
Just get in the car ok?
Hurry up.
Do you know you pick your nails when you're anxious?
I've never been in a bureau car chasing a killer before.
You ready to meet william face to face?
It's about damn time.
Dad where are you going?
Quiet. Just shut up and let me think.
Daddy...
I'm sorry kiddo. I didn't mean to yell at you.
Where's mommy?
That's a good question.
That's him calling.
Well don't answer it.
We need to talk.
I am pregnant.
It's his.
Oh my god.
Come on pick up.
Ok we're going to uh...
go hang out somewhere
and wait for mommy to call back all right?
Ok.
What about that one couple from earlier?
His office said he's out of town.
I haven't been able to get ahold of her yet.
It's Morgan. Hey Morgan.
Yeah Reid listen I'm at the son's school.
Principal says that J.D. Hodges
was pulled out of class 45 minutes ago.
By who?
The unsub.
They're in the wind kid.
He's gonna try and leave with his family.
All right thanks I'll let everyone know.
Garcia?
What up JJ?
Can you find out if Rebecca Hodges has a cell phone?
We want to try and track where she is right now.
Uno momento.
Something's weird.
What?
The wife has 2 cell phones listed in her name.
One could be hers one could be his?
He put them both in her name.
Yeah but they're both active in the same quadrant right now.
Where?
Some posh Ft. Lauderdale neighborhood.
Wait a second.
A couple on our potential victims list lives in the same area.
Hector and Brooke Sanchez.
That's the woman I can't get ahold of.
Hotch.
Ok got it Reid.
Direct everyone to the Sanchez house.
Thanks.
What's the wife doing at a victim's house?
Were we wrong about her?
Do you think she's complicit?
I don't think so. If she was he'd use her in the con.
He told me his name was Hunter Portland.
How long have you been seeing him?
We vacationed in St. Croix together.
What? When?
Last month.
He said he was in Boston on a business trip.
Brooke you here?
You must think I'm an idiot.
It's not true.
How could you do this to your family?
I provide everything for my family.
Were you just after my money this whole time?
No. No I told you I was gonna take care of you.
All those times you traveled for work--
Are there other women?
God what are you even doing here?!
Daddy?
I told you to wait in the car.
J.D. come here.
Please just let him come here.
You think that I would hurt my own son?
Well you're obviously capable of anything.
Please Bill he doesn't need to see this.
How long did you think you were gong to
get away with this Hunter?
Bill let's just leave.
Just stop talking both of you!
Bill.
Shut up!
We got a car down the street and one in the driveway.
Both plates match the wife's name.
Remember there's a 9-year-old boy in there
and I wouldn't put it past him to hurt his own family.
or himself.
Ok we'll take the back. You ready?
Bill!
You really are a son of a bitch Hunter.
Bill--
Whatever!
Bill. Let's just go.
Randy. Hunter.
Let's go!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Daddy!
Stop. No.
J.D.!
FBI. Put your hands in the air.
Oh my god.
Please step back.
Bill let him go.
Let the boy go to his mother and put your hands up.
You must be tired keeping up with all these lies.
You don't need to do this anymore.
Let him go.
Bill please let him go.
Daddy...
J.D...
Go to your mom ok?
Go to your mom.
Sweetie come here.
Put your hands up.
Put your hands up.
Don't do that!
Take your hands out of your pockets!
Don't!
"Oh what a tangled web we weave
when first we practice to deceive."
Sir Walter Scott.
Do you think my husband did all this?
I'm afraid so.
The man I lived with for 10 years
was loving and gentle.
He isn't capable of this.
There's more about him that we don't know.
You should be prepared.
You're going to be interviewed in detail.
Right now I want to take my son home.
Ok. I'll have someone drive you.
Mommy!
Oh mommy's here baby.
You know your daddy loved you more than anything right?
I know.
So where do you want these?
I don't care.
Are you ok?
I thought he had a weapon.
Yeah. That was a justified shot.
Why did he do that?
He had a wife a son.
A guy like that
He likes his car his house his lifestyle.
He knew he wasn't going to do well in prison.
So he decided his own fate.
I never even found out his real name.
