Ready?
Oh, yeah.
She's beautiful.
She was.
Can you make it radioactive?
What do you think that was?
Joke.
Yes. Cesium-137, just like you want.
How long before it's ready?
48 hours.
I need it in 36.
第一季 第六集
第152号
Are you telling me that
you have known about this?
Yes! I found it!
When?
When I was cleaning up your blood.
Liz, that was weeks ago.
What else are you not telling me?
What am I not telling you?!
What the hell is this, and why is it in our house?
I mean, there's a gun in here, Liz, and there's --
there's passports with my face on it and, uh, these names.
Who the hell is Anton Piere Louis?
Do you really expect me to believe
that you've never seen any of this before?
And how much money is this anyways?
I mean, this is a fortune.
Are you serious about all this?
Is this you?
Are you interrogating me now?
This -- it's a picture of you at the Angel Station Hotel in Boston.
Yeah. So what?
There was a murder there
that matches this gun --
an agent named Victor Fokin,
a Russian agent who was in the process of defecting
when he was killed before he could say anything.
Are you telling me, like, what --
like, you think that I murdered a KGB defector, like I'm Bond?
I'm Tom Bond,
and I just, uh -- between social studies and recess,
I go around assassinating people.
I had my job interview there, Liz, at the coffee shop.
That's enough.
Some of the dates on these passports --
You know, I can't believe that you're accusing me of this,
because your job is the reason
that a man came in here and cut me in half!
No. March 12, 2011.
Your bachelor party.
In Las Vegas.
I've never seen pictures.
You never will!
I was gone for 36 hours!
You can get to Paris and back in 19.
I'm not gonna sit here and...
Your job -- anything that is evil or bad --
it comes from what you do, not what I do!
It's not my picture on these passports.
Okay!
If you think I am guilty,
then why don't you do something about it?
Why don't you call the FBI?
Fine.
Do it. Go ahead. Do it.
You think I'm kidding? Do you think I'm kidding?
Liz, it's -- it's me.
I don't know what's going on,
but I know that this is a huge misunderstanding.
Make -- make the call.
They'll separate us.
They'll dig through your life, my life,
with a fine-tooth comb.
They'll...
Our entire lives will be up for grabs.
I got nothing to hide.
Let them.
Identification, please.
Agent Keen, 1212-654 White bear.
I need clearance for an incoming client.
Client?
Thomas Vincent Keen.
My husband.
Was that necessary?
I thought we were going to the FBI.
I don't work at the FBI.
What do you mean, "Black site"?
I don't understand. Where are we?
This is where I work, Tom.
Mr. Keen, I need you to come with me.
Wait.
Make it quick.
You're gonna be okay.
Just tell them what happened. Tell the truth.
Okay.
Where are they taking him?
If I were you, I'd worry about myself.
I'm looking at it right now.
It's beautiful.
What? Oh, the blues?
Well, the blues look...
Blue.
Green and gray, the gaping maw of the ocean.
It's mesmerizing.
I don't know why the hell I'm doing this.
This painting should be hanging in Boston.
No, I know.
My man in the port of Dubai
says payment was sent last week.
The painting will be in hand well before the wedding.
Yes.
Hakim, remember me to your wives -- all of them.
What is it?
It's about Agent Keen and her husband.
When this all started,
when Reddington turned himself in and asked for you,
I was skeptical, suspicious.
But I'll be honest. You've done good work.
And I've come to believe that you were just as surprised
as the rest of us when he picked you.
But now this.
I need you to help me understand what's going on here.
The gun, the money, and passports were in my house.
A hatch in the floor.
The gun was used in an unsolved homicide.
Yes.
You pulled a ballistics report.
Tom is my husband.
I brought him here, to you, for help, to find answers.
I want to know who killed that FSB agent as much --
More than you do.
If we can solve that murder --
We're not gonna do anything.
Until this matter is resolved, I'm putting you on leave.
What?
No. Tom is here.
Agent Keen...
Go home.
Oh, thank you very much.
Meera Malik.
Tom Keen.
But, uh, you probably already know that.
Look, I-I came here voluntarily, so...
Where should we start?
I just want to know the truth.
Tell me about the murder.
People think it matters who occupies that house.
It doesn't.
Multinational corporations and criminals run the world.
I thought we were here to talk about Tom.
You've obviously heard of corporate espionage --
Companies trying to beat other companies to be the first hand on the dollar.
But what if it were taken a few steps further?
In 1982, seven people in Chicago were killed
by an over-the-counter drug laced with potassium cyanide.
The company's market share went from 35 to 8.
It was never determined how the drug was poisoned,
but I will tell you someone was hired to do that.
Remember those tire recalls, Chernobyl?
Deliberate and malevolent actions taken by corporations
to protect their vital interests.
Nothing happens by chance.
That's why I'm here, Lizzy.
Because there's a woman --
Gina Zanetakos.
I don't know who that is.
Gina Zanetakos is a corporate terrorist.
And frankly, she's the best of the bunch.
Lizzy, if you want to find the truth about your husband,
then you need to find Gina.
Why? Does she know Tom?
Because she's Tom's lover.
I fail to see how suspicions about her husband
affect our arrangement.
Agent Keen is on leave.
Well, then, lives will be lost.
What if I were to deliver to you a terrorist,
not your run-of-the-mill ideologue
answering to bearded men in caves,
but someone entirely different --
less predictable and far more dangerous.
I'd say delivering criminals to me is your job.
My job is my business, Harold.
Delivering criminals to you is a hobby, a diversion,
one that may become tiresome,
in which case we could always reminisce
about that unfortunate incident in Kuwait.
Are you threatening me, Red?
I am.
Hardly the time to let morals stand in the way
of your upward mobility, Agent Cooper.
I had a job interview. I am a teacher.
Fourth grade.
I got a call from the Rothwell School in Cambridge.
Who called you?
Uh, Walter -- Walter Burris.
He's the headmaster.
He said he saw my application and, uh, he was impressed
and would I mind coming in for a meeting.
Lizzy and I decided to make a weekend of it,
so we got a room at the Tellamy Cove Inn.
We got in Friday night.
We had dinner at the restaurant next door,
which you can verify, because I used my credit card.
And then the next day,
I met with Burris at the Angel Station Hotel.
Not the school.
No, he called me that morning,
and he said he was already downtown on some other business,
and would I mind meeting him at the hotel.
It's bad luck, right?
Excuse me?
Your meeting gets changed
to the exact location a man is assassinated.
What would you call it?
Yesterday, I would have called it a coincidence.
Look, I don't belong here.
Just call Walter Burris, okay?
He'll verify everything I'm telling you.
Where are we on the contents of the box?
Still working on those passports and tracing the money,
but ballistics did confirm
that it was the gun used to kill Victor Fokin.
The good news -- we actually did find
a partial on one of the casings in the magazine.
But it's not Tom Keen's,
and there were no hits on it through AFIS.
Give me updates as soon as you have them.
Meanwhile, there's been a development.
Reddington's brought us a case.
It's about time he realizes that he has to talk directly to us.
He won't.
Sir, I think it's entirely inappropriate
that Keen is on the case
when her husband's being investigated for murder.
There's been a change of plans.
According to Reddington, her real name is Gina Zanetakos.
Nearly a year ago,
she reached out to him as Shubie Hartwell.
She wanted Red to broker a deal to assassinate
a Supreme Court judge who was the swing vote
in a case that could have cost her corporate clients billions.
Custom documents indicate
Shubie Hartwell entered the country yesterday.
We've got a credit card in her name
that was last used under an hour ago.
Purchased two cocktails at the bar in the Quay Hotel.
Call the hotel manager.
Have him start pulling security tape.
See who she was having drinks with.
Agent Keen?
I feel like... I've seen her before.
Show me.
Come on. I already told you I have it.
I have to pick up my son from piano in an hour.
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
Got confirmation yesterday.
On its way. It's official.
It's official.
What the...?
Too much?
Be careful. No, be careful.
If Melinda sees any more marks on my neck,
she's...gonna...
Gonna what?
Mr. Burris, thank you again for meeting with me.
Tell me, is this the man you interviewed
for a position here at Rothwell?
Did the two of you meet in the coffee shop
of the Angel Station Hotel?
Meera, it's Liz.
Give me a call as soon as you speak with the headmaster.
I'd like to know how things are going.
She's not calling you back.
This is the door? I'll take the key.
Step back, please.
She shouldn't even have told you what she told you.
And why is that?
Because you could be an accessory for all we know.
FBI.
Check him.
Clear. I'm headed down to security.
Call an ambulance.
Girls, come on.
Hold on, hold on!
Come on. Everybody in.
Wait up!
Christina, come on. Move your can, please.
Mobilize D.C. Metro.
Have teams lock down the Quay Hotel and a two-block radius.
No, no, no.
I'm headed down to the security desk now to pull footage.
It's gonna be room 1232.
And make sure that ambulance shows up now.
Let's go. Let's go.
Gina?
Hardly.
Ressler? Why do you have her phone?
Wh-- did you find her? Did you stop her?
Not exactly.
Okay, we're working on a current address for Zanetakos.
Her phone provided a treasure trove of messages.
She was in frequent contact
with a multinational company called the Hanar Group.
But more worrisome
is a message that came in today around three hours ago --
A call that originated from Berlin.
Change of plans.
Had to use cobalt 60.
Still good to go. Best guess --
4:00 p.m. Central.
Cobalt 60?
They're talking about a dirty bomb here.
But what's the target?
We believe Zanetakos is planning to detonate a dirty bomb
somewhere in the central time zone of the United States.
Why would she want to do that, Lizzy?
Somebody hired this woman.
She killed a man today -- Nadeem Idris.
He was an attache at the Turkish Embassy.
Looks like they were having an affair.
We suspect it was a means to an end.
Have you found the connection to your husband?
We have looked through all of Zanetakos' phone messages,
all her records.
There wasn't a single message from Tom.
Perhaps they exchanged letters.
There's nothing between them.
My husband is innocent.
Did you talk to Burris?
Please take a seat.
He backed me up, though, right?
Okay, who is this?
You don't know?
No.
That's Walter Burris,
the headmaster at the Rothwell School.
W-w-what is this, some kind of trick?
Did this guy say he met with me?
Because I didn't meet with him.
And if he says that he met with me,
then he's lying. He is lying to you.
Because I've never seen this guy before in my life, not once.
He's being set up.
Look, uh, I met with a man who --
who claimed to be Walter Burris.
For 45 minutes, he interviewed me.
Look, is Lizzy back there?
I need you to stay seated.
Look, I didn't do anything, okay?
You have to believe me.
All I did was walk out of a hotel,
and someone took a picture, okay?
Someone is doing this to me!
The picture.
Look, I-I don't know what you think I did
or who you think I...
FBI!
Clear!
Ressler.
Victor Fokin, the FSB agent.
She was watching him.
So she could kill him, not Tom.
She's an assassin.
Guys, you might want to check this out.
Found this by her bed.
Give us a minute.
This is evidence.
Listen, Keen, whatever you think this may mean,
I admire what you're doing, standing up for your husband,
but...I think we both know
it's time for you to protect yourself.
I didn't know where else to go.
We found a picture of Tom in her house.
He said he doesn't know her, but clearly he does.
So much is happening,
and I just don't know how to process it all.
I mean, a part of me thinks
that you're manipulating this whole thing
and you're trying to ruin my life.
But that's just a part of...
But if I'm wrong about Tom...
If he isn't who...
I don't think I can handle any of it without him.
I feel like I'm drowning,
like I don't know what's real or who I can trust.
You can trust me.
I needed you to be wrong about him.
Your husband may have been connected to our primary suspect.
If I let you into the field and you discover
some incriminating information on him,
I have no reason to believe you won't suppress it.
But circumstances require your continued involvement.
We found something on Zanetakos' hard drive --
Money she wired to a dummy corp in Berlin.
Interpol says the funds are linked
to a man named Maxwell Ruddiger,
a bomb expert operating out of Europe.
And you need me because you need Red to find this guy.
Ruddiger's our best connection,
not only to Zanetakos, but your husband.
Find him.
No. Hakim, that is not the problem.
Listen to me. Shipping is my business.
Once I receive payment, the merchandise ships.
That's the deal.
According to my man in Houston, the payment's not there.
It's been diverted to New Orleans,
which is entirely unacceptable.
Well, I don't care if the wedding is Saturday.
All I care about is my payment.
Hakim, this conversation is over.
Hello, Lizzy.
What can I do for you?
Maxwell Ruddiger. Tremendous bomb maker.
Haphazard as hell, terrible drinker,
but he gets the job done.
Zanetakos made a wire payment to him a few weeks ago.
So he's the link.
Ruddiger can get you to Zanetakos,
and she'll get you to Tom.
Can you help me find him?
I hear you're using cobalt 60 in the device,
and you know as well as I
there's only one reputable supplier on the market,
and that's our friend Yuri.
Now, I like Yuri.
I floated in the Dead Sea with Yuri,
climbed Masada with his wife.
But if your device goes off, they'll be looking to him.
And if they look to him...
they'll look to me.
Because Yuri talks faster than a cheerleader
after a nooner under the grandstands.
Probably not a metaphor you understand.
But you do understand my position.
So...
I need your help, Max.
I need to know about this device you've made for Gina.
Red, I'm sorry.
I can't.
Just like I wouldn't do the betray to you,
I can't do that to her.
That's unfortunate.
I'm in the middle of negotiating something very interesting,
something unique in Syria.
I'll be playing all sides.
I thought there might be a place for you at the table.
Another day.
I know that you're in there.
I know you're in there.
I know you're watching, and I didn't do anything.
Lizzy...
Honey, please. I didn't do anything.
It's a sedan.
The car is the bomb.
Contamination radius of over five miles.
When will it detonate?
19 hours.
Don't know where.
Then we'll have to ask Gina.
Call her.
I just need to know where she is.
This will never come back on you.
I know you want to get your hands around her neck.
But when you do, don't kill her.
Kill her? I want to talk to her.
All right, let's go. Huddle up.
All right, let's make this quick and clean.
Once you get a visual I.D. on Zanetakos, call it.
We'll move in. We'll take her.
No shots fired.
Let's not make the 6:00 news, all right?
She's moving north.
Copy that. All units converge on my go.
I've got her. East green, moving.
She's making a break for it.
Keen, talk to me.
No! Call medevac!
We need someone in here now.
Don't die.
What the hell did you do?
Excuse me?
Calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down!
Agent Keen
That woman was the link!
She was the only proof that my husband is innocent!
And now she's what? Dying?
Lying unconscious in some hospital?
She's in surgery.
Have we forgotten that there's a bomb out there?
I haven't forgotten anything. I've been here for seven years.
You've been here for seven weeks.
We have less than four hours.
You think we don't know that?
What, is Zanetakos gonna come out of surgery by then?
Because that was the only lead we have!
I told you to calm down.
The bomb -- what do you know?
We know what you know.
It's built into a car, German-made. It's dirty.
Well, do you know why Zanetakos killed Nadeem Idris in that hotel
or how the Hanar Group is connected,
who their enemies are?
The investors.
What do you mean investors?
The company stock is at an all-time low.
They're in trouble,
dragged down by a 48% drop in the market share
of their largest division.
What division?
Shipping. They operate a port in New Orleans.
New Orleans -- what do you know about it?
Quite a lot. What do you have in mind?
You were on the phone.
That guy -- someone was getting married. You were talking
something about New Orleans and the ports.
Yes.
You told the man on the phone your payment was diverted. Why?
It happens every once in a while, but this was unprecedented.
An associate of mine in New Orleans
was advising illicit traffic in the gulf
to be rerouted to New Orleans.
The Hanar Group hired Zanetakos.
They're a majority owner of a port in New Orleans.
Where was your payment diverted from?
Houston.
That's the target.
New Orleans and Houston are the two biggest ports in the gulf.
If Houston were to close...
because of radioactive contamination.
All traffic would have to be diverted to New Orleans.
Hanar's profits would soar.
They'd be the only game in the gulf.
That's my girl.
The port of Houston.
You need to halt all cargo traffic headed there right now.
That's the destination.
The Hanar Group hired Zanetakos to bomb the port.
It could be anywhere.
Your girlfriend's been shot.
What are you talking about? Liz?
Her -- Gina Zanetakos. - Who?
The one who helped you kill Fokin.
I didn't kill anyone.
What do you know about the bomb?
What do you know about the ship?
What ship?! I don't know what you're talking about.
How about a manifest, a crate number?
Help me, Tom!
Why don't you help me? Because I didn't do anything.
I don't know who this woman is.
I don't know anything about a bomb or a boat.
I don't know why there was a gun in my house
or money or passports.
All I know about is this. You think I faked this?
You think I invited a psychopath
into my house to gut me?
This is real.
In less than an hour, a bomb is gonna go off,
and people are gonna die.
We've been through five sections and found nothing.
This port is 25 miles long.
It will take us weeks to inspect it all.
We've got less than an hour.
We're missing something.
The Hanar Group -- they hire Zanetakos.
She contracted Ruddiger to build a bomb. But...
something's missing.
Nadeem Idris.
What ships have been in or out of here in the last week from Turkey?
None.
Why would Zanetakos need
a low-level Turkish diplomat
to get a car bomb into the country?
Because it's illegal to search diplomatic cargo.
With his help,
Zanetakos was able to get the car in without inspection.
It's on one of these ships.
Check the manifests for all incoming ships
for any items signed by Nadeem Idris.
Security, check all the shipping logs.
It's re-fabricated.
I've never seen anything like it.
The bomb's not just inside the car.
It is the car.
Well, we've got minutes here.
What we've got is a big-ass problem.
There's over 2,000 people who work in this harbor.
It will take hours to evacuate.
We've only got 10 minutes.
Can I explain something? This thing is radiological.
When it detonates,
it will go airborne,
and everything within a five-mile radius will be contaminated.
My suggestion is you take the last 10 minutes
and get the hell out of here.
What if we put it in the water?
The radiation can be contained underwater.
How do we get this off the ship?
We crane it off.
This isn't gonna work.
It'll work.
It's not gonna work. We got less than a minute.
We're running out of time.
Move! Come on. Get out.
Because there was no airborne exposure,
the NRC is saying that contamination was contained,
which is the only reason
why the U.S. Attorney is considering a plea agreement
in exchange for your cooperation --
Your full cooperation. Is that clear?
Yes.
Your prints are on a nine-millimeter
used to assassinate Victor Fokin in Boston last June.
Did you kill him?
Yes.
Why?
Someone didn't want him to talk.
Go on.
He was a Russian agent defecting to the U.S.
Somebody didn't want him spilling secrets.
What secrets?
Fokin had information
about the route Chechen guerrillas were using
to move their supplies to their soldiers on the Russian border.
The guy who hired me was making millions providing those supplies.
His name is Raymond Reddington.
Do you know Tom Keen?
We found this picture of him in your apartment.
Never seen him before.
Tom?
That's him --
who I met with.
That's the guy who interviewed me for the job.
Please do come in.
You and I -- we're done.
I heard about Tom.
Yeah. Zanetakos confessed.
Or took the fall.
The passports? Forged.
The money in the box?
Traced to an offshore account of yours.
I can only lead you to the truth. I can't make you believe it.
The truth is that you're a sick, twisted man.
This, your obsession with me --
You put Tom's picture in Zanetakos' apartment.
No.
You hired her to kill Victor Fokin.
You set my husband up by having your errand boy lure him to Boston.
Is that what Tom said?
I don't understand why you would do this, any of it!
Go to hell.
Oh, the one night you're on time.
I was really looking forward to the make-up sex.
Do you believe he's innocent?
It can't be that simple, right?
The only thing that's clear to me
is that he doesn't work for Reddington.
Well, then, who the hell does he work for?
