Good evening
Tonight we review to you the fate of Ned and Edna
I devote my summer to a more meaningful task
salvaging Mr. Poppers' Penguins on line
2011年美国喜剧电影
Anyway, the answer to Ned and Edna
is carefully hidden in tonight's episode,
like a bread crumb lodged inside my stomach crease.
Enjoy.
第二十三季 第一集
What the...?
Quiet steps are what I take
Sneaking in at noon
Just in time for my lunch break
Got my fork and spoon
Time the cameras just right
Duck in the bathroom
Hi, Homer!
I'm still drunk from last night
Got driven home
I don't know by whom
Some may say
I don't deserve any pay
But hey
I came up with '60s Day
Last May.
While I'm here, I might as well pre-punch out.
Hmm, we've had a lot of bills lately.
Better put in some overtime.
Larry, my man!
Hey, you're not Larry.
How come you're not Larry?
I wouldn't know, sir.
Uh, listen, if you could indulge me,
Larry and I fist-bump every morning.
Like that.
The warmth of human contact
with a manly whiff of violence.
Not interested.
Hey, what's with that new security guard?
He's acting all aloof.
Uh, by the way, that's my word of the day: "He's."
Maybe I was a little hard on him,
expecting him to be Larry right away.
By the way, where is Larry?
Crazy house. Violent ward.
Good ol' Larry.
Say... Wayne,
I couldn't help but notice
that your breath doesn't smell like alcohol.
You want to go grab a beer after work?
I prefer not to have social interaction with coworkers.
It, um, hasn't worked out for me in the past.
Well, maybe he just doesn't like fist-bumping.
Hey, Wayne.
As God as my witness, this fist will be bumped!
Put that fool thing down.
We now return to
Master Chef: Extreme Snack Edition.
Marge, your ratio of peanut butter
to cracker was spot on.
And I loved the addition of the thin slice of apple.
This was a great plate of food.
Thank you.
This is my third favorite reality cooking show.
For your prize, you have won a brand-new kitchen,
which I will now become.
I miss my soul patch.
Kids, enjoy your extreme snack.
Wait, this tastes different.
I put a slice of apple in it.
Gross.
You know I hate surprises.
You tricked us.
I like routine. I like routine.
Did you have a hard day, too?
Ah, a guy at work seems not to like me.
I guess it's not much
when you look at real problems in the world,
like Major League umpires not using instant replay.
It's big to you.
Would you like a get well pork chop?
I love you so much.
Potatoes and gravy on the side, please.
Charlie, want to grab a beer?
No, I was tipsy last night when a telephone survey called,
so I told them to call back tonight
for more accurate answers.
Oh. Okay.
Wayne!
Want a ride?
I can walk.
All right, Homer, you win.
You know,
I just got a little chill when you said my name.
Every town I go to,
I run into some guy just like this.
Look, I'm not weird or anything,
I just like to feel like I'm friends with everybody.
Homer, you're a nice guy.
I'll have one beer with you.
After that, we will have
a courteous professional relationship, and that's it.
No secret Santa, we're not trading lunches,
And I don't want you
calling me at home and saying "Turn on channel six."
But what if the weather girl...
I don't care!
Wow, I can't believe Homer bagged the tiger.
Excuse me, I need to use the...
Men's room!
Oh, my God.
We're completing each other's...
Completing each other's...
sen... ten... ces...
Totally surprising entrance!
Hand over your cash and jewelry.
Pronto.
Okay, now, don't want no trouble.
Let me just get my cash out of my cash drawer here.
Just, uh, lining up all the presidents, nice and neat.
Ain't trying to be no hero.
Uh, here you go.
Thanks for the upgrade.
Wayne?
Stand back, Homer!
I know what I'm doing.
Well, we all know what we're doing.
The question is,
is it an appropriate reaction to the situation?
My fresco!
That's coming out of your stealings!
Wayne, maybe it's the me being still alive talking,
but I think you're awesome.
I'm just a guy who saw what needed to be done and did it.
Oh, speaking of which,
let's get these eggs back in a jar.
Wow, that's the farthest that one of my eggs
ever made it down someone's throat.
It's great to have a home-cooked meal.
Well, if anyone saves my Homie's life,
they get a free meal.
Which actually comes up about once a week.
So, Wayne, how'd you learn
all those cool self-defense moves?
I had training.
Special training.
The kind they're not allowed to give anymore.
Sorry.
I have to go.
Oh, come on, stay for dessert!
Hey, Simpson,
you want to hear about the big change in my life?
Sure, why not.
I started drinking orange juice with pulp.
I asked the Reverend, and he said it was okay.
Then he hung right up on me.
That man is cranky at 3:00 in the morning.
And here he is, this week's Noble Nobody.
What the...
A quiet, unassuming security guard
who foiled a robbery at a local tavern,
as seen in this Taiwanese animated dramatization.
Please, sir, just let me do my job.
Pish tush.
Wayne, as a reward for your valiant fisticuffery,
I hereby award you
the Springfield Nuclear Plant Silver Safety Hat.
Thanks to you, Wayne,
we did not lose the visible half of the moon.
Just doing my job, sir.
All too well.
I'm afraid that protocol demands
that I totally erase your memory.
Die, you fascist bastard!
Mother, is that you?
Wayne, stop! That's Mr. Burns!
I expect insolence, but rank insolence?
Off with his job!
Damn it.
Why don't you come stay with us
till you can get back on your feet?
Really? Are you sure?
Of course.
I mean, how long could it be?
I don't know.
I've got no job, no references, can't afford my apartment.
It's best to concentrate on what you do have.
I have reoccurring flashbacks to a nightmarish past.
That's funny, because I have
reoccurring flash-forwards to a nightmarish future.
Unfair! Unfair!
That robot took our jobs!
He said it.
Or, uh, maybe it was him.
Man, this robot really gets me.
My nightmares are real.
Your voice is so gravelly,
just like Lauren Bacall's.
If you don't listen to me, Senator,
there's not going to be a Fourth of July!
Don't you get it? He used the governor's eyeball
for the retinal scan!
That's ten members of the electoral college
dead in one day!
If you don't give me those launch codes,
you'll never be able to make the "Okay" Sign again.
I know the map is inside your eyelids,
and I will turn them inside out if I have to!
If you move that little top hat to St. James Place,
we'll all be blown to kingdom come!
Bring me every fish in that aquarium!
One of them is lying!
I'm sorry I have so many nightmares.
I've done unspeakable things,
from Buenos Aires to the Ukraine.
Well, what brought you to Springfield?
Was it our Frito-Lay distribution center?
I needed somewhere to lie low.
Your town appears on no maps or charts.
Yeah, they couldn't find a Google map photo
without me naked or urinating.
And when there was a mapmaker's convention here,
they all got Lou Gehrig's disease.
Not the one you're thinking of...
there's another one.
So, Lisa, if you press on Bart's elbow,
here,
he'll tell you anything you want to know.
I admit it! I let Milhouse
lie down in your bed!
Kids, can I talk to Wayne alone a minute?
Remember everything they say,
and tell us later in rattle code.
What do you mean, "no"?
I don't know if you should teach our children
advanced interrogation techniques.
I'm sorry, Marge.
Sometimes I forget where I am.
Apology accepted.
Now, could you teach me a couple little driving tricks?
We'll see who gets their pick
of pizza pockets!
Give us your lunch money!
What gives, man?
Where'd you learn that stuff?
If I told you, I'd have to kill you.
Can I tell you?
No! I won't listen!
We can't keep serving the same thing every day.
These kids have mashed potatoes coming out of their ears.
Point taken.
Oh, my God. That song.
I can't live in the real world anymore.
This is the real world?
Hallelujah! I'm still alive!
Ha-ha! And I'll appreciate every moment!
Except the ones that aren't as good as they used to be.
Which is all of them.
Oh, someone kill me.
Ah, junk, junk.
Beyonc confirms she will play at my daughter's sweet 16 party.
Humorous YouTube sent by my brother.
Mildly funny, at best.
Eh, sometimes they are good for giggle.
"Auto-tune disaster victim."
"Crazy man attacks boss."
It's him.
American agent who caused the death of everyone I loved!
You want to give it zero stars?
No! We will go to...
Springfield, America,
and kill this man.
But first...
Out the dog poo
Sure beats picking it up
Flanders' driveway
Is my goal
I am looking for a man named Wayne.
Oh. He's gone. I don't know where he went.
Are you friend of his?
He has no friends.
Except me!
I see you are tight like borscht and beets.
Tell me, if we kidnapped a friend of Wayne's,
would he attempt to rescue that friend?
Well, I suppose if the friend was being horribly tortured...
H-Hey, wha? Wha? Wha?
No! Not the middle seat!
This just in: a local man has been kidnapped
by Ukrainian gangsters.
We've received the following video.
Death to America!
Stick to script.
Fine.
I am being held somewhere in the Springfield area.
Turn the card.
Hold up today's newspaper.
What will you guys use when there aren't newspapers anymore?
Perhaps we will be living
in a world where there'll be no need to kidnap.
Oh, well, way to make me feel obsolete.
Oh, look-- here's a coupon for scissors
that you have to cut out! Thanks, geniuses!
Shut up.
Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing!
This is no way to treat the talent.
Shut up!
Oh, God.
I know that voice.
Viktor?
Darling, I told you to stay in your room.
I told you the bedspread smells funny.
Nyet...!
Marge...
I'll get your husband back.
How are you going to find him?
Homer is implanted with several highly powerful tracking chips.
How did that happen?
I left that out in a bowl and he ate them.
I'd take a moment to enjoy those store names
if I didn't have a job to do.
Get out of here!
Aah! I won a silver medal in Nagano--
ow!-- and now this!
Oh... cold...
so cold...
So, Wayne,
once again you crash my party?
So cold! Warm me up!
Stop it!
Just let me put my hands
under your armpits.
So much violence on the surface world.
I'm going back.
Cold... so cold...
Now you can see why I can't stay in one place.
Not here, not anywhere.
How about living on a train that's always moving?
You ever eat on a train, Marge?
What they call a steak
is barely a hamburger. Now, Homer,
there's one more thing before I go.
That's what I call closure.
Good-bye.
Yes, Maggie, we will have a use for you soon.
Stay close to your busy box.
Wait!
I know a place you can go!
A place where a sadistic man with government experience
can feel right at home.
Sir, this is the wrong form.
Can you hold my space while I go get the right one?
Nobody held my space when I was in a North Korean prison
being forced to write a musical about Kim Jung Il
with a car battery hooked up to my nipples!
词曲 韦恩·斯莱特
Well...
Pardon me, sir,
can you tell me where palace is?
What business do you have at the palace?
Why, someday I'm going to be dear leader.
You? You are too benevolent to be dear leader!
Let's see what they think.
K" Is Korea, just the north par
"I" Is for the Internet he bans
"M" Is for the millions that are missing
J" Is for a human-tasting jam
"O" Is for oh, boy, we love our leader
"N" Is for the best Korea, North?
"G" Is for gee whiz, we love our leader, mmm...
We just wanted to give you all a big thank you from Team Nedna.
It's nice to know people still believe in love.
Now, wait just a minute--
how come I wasn't an option in this contest?
Typical Seymour!
Waits till the polls have closed
before throwing his hat in the ring.
I agree with America: you'll never give me a grandchild.
Thank you.
