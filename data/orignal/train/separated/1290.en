I won't let you down! You can count on me!
Thank you! Thank you so much!
Yes!
yes!
Yes! Oh! Yes!
Life is good! Oh, yeah!
Go, Lianne! Uh-huh!
Life is good!
This is terrible.
Oh, my god, Jane.
Don't panic.
Too late.
I need to see it again.
Wait, no.
Too much screen time is bad for you.
Take a break. Go cut open a body.
Okay, they said your apartment burned down
Because of faulty wiring.
They did.
But this is arson.
It was.
And you're not worried?
Somebody picked my very good lock.
Look, if -- if they wanted to hurt me,
They would have broken in when I was home.
And these are the thoughts that give you comfort?
Yeah.
So, what about the hacking?
Or the -- the damage to your credit
Or the accounts being closed?
They are open again, and I have a shiny, new credit card.
Maura...
Jane, someone burned down your apartment!
Yes. And then they told me about it.
Okay, so, what else are they gonna tell you about?
Well, I don't know, maura, but I'm sure it's gonna be worse.
Isn't that what you're thinking? 'cause that's what I'm thinking.
That's what I lay awake thinking about every night!
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jane.
I did not -- i did not mean to upset you.
No, I'm already upset.
But I'm not gonna quit my job. Then the bad guy wins.
This is just...
It's a horrible burden on you.
I... I'm sure for angela.
No. No, no, no, no, no, no,
She can't know anything about this.
Well, you have to tell her.
No, I don't.
And neither do you. And you're not going to.
That's why I'm showing you this now so you can get ready.
Well, I can't lie.
Yes, you can.
That's the beauty of the new you.
I can try.
I have confidence in you.
Isles.
On my way.
homicide.
Hey, h-hold the elevator! I'll get my jacket!
Well, you're not going anywhere.
What?
Start pulling files of anybody that may have a beef with you.
Okay, I can do that when we get back.
You put a lot of people away. It'll be a big pile.
Korsak, I don't need to --
Stop. Desk. Go.
This is interesting.
Last thing I expected to hear here.
What would you expect?
Sad story.
Well, this is interesting and sad.
She's got track marks, but they're old.
Scars have healed.
It's possible she stopped using some months ago.
What's that?
A tattoo of a butterfly.
Beautiful. And it's recent.
Junkie gets clean,
Comes here, tries to start a new life.
Gets a hopeful tattoo, falls off the wagon.
Well, it's a quick and violent death.
The foaming around the mouth indicates a drug overdose,
Probably from cocaine.
Well, she had plenty of cash for a party.
There wasn't one, though.
There were no drugs, no paraphernalia.
And no cocaine residue around the nose.
Perhaps she was injecting someplace
the supervisors of the halfway house wouldn't notice.
Hey, doc, could you give me an estimate of the victim's shoe size?
7.
That's a man's 12.
Maybe he brought the party.
Let's find out who was here.
And not invite him to my party.
Almost done.
She said that half an hour ago.
Maybe I'll save time and write out my 10-page paper by hand.
Can you do that when you're unconscious?
Jane, I found something interesting.
Yeah, me too.
People are impatient.
What's all this?
Uh, Korsak's having me print up
All the threatening e-mails I've received.
That's a lot.
Yeah, and this is just from this year.
Trying to figure out how to sort them --
Chronological order, type of threat...
Overuse of block letters.
When you're done, meet me in BRIC.
Okay.
It's all yours.
What's going on?
I've been working on the video your apartment arsonist sent.
Ooh, does it end differently?
Kind of.
Really?
Okay, I'm listening.
Digital cameras shoot raw images.
They're high-quality, uncompressed files,
Which the camera's software edits into a standard frame.
That's what you see in the image viewer,
But the full image still exists.
If you can access the raw data,
You can see outside the frame.
Isn't that cheating?
Yeah. That's why it's fun.
Watch.
that's the standard image.
Here's the raw.
You're amazing.
Okay, run a search on
all arsonists with butterfly tattoos.
I already did. Nothing came up.
Okay, let's get this to every local tattoo artist.
If we can find the artist, they can lead us to the arsonist.
Wait, is that Lianne Sampson? What?
Uh, the victim from the scene I just came from.
She died of a drug overdose.
She had a tattoo of a butterfly on her left wrist.
That's my murder victim.
No, that's my murder victim.
This threatening pile of e-mails is all from women.
There's no Lianne Sampson.
Anything mention arson or hacking?
Maybe she used a different name.
I have a "You're dead, bitch."
"Dead" Is spelled d-e-d.
I feel pretty good about eliminating her.
Yeah.
As a suspect or a spelling-bee contestant.
Well, you don't need to be a good speller
to burn something down.
No, but you do need some degree of competence
if you're gonna hack into all my accounts.
She could have hired somebody to do that.
Yeah.
Lianne Sampson was paroled two months ago
for petty theft.
Petty theft.
Lots of petty theft.
No, I've never had any contact with this woman.
Throwaway kid in and out of group homes,
becomes a drug-addicted adult.
But she's been sober for the last six months.
Not so sure about that.
Part of her parole was that she was tested every week.
As of last Thursday, she was clean.
What's her connection to Jane?
There is none. She burned down my apartment.
Yeah, there's that.
We'll keep looking.
Okay. Maybe somebody hired her.
Would explain all the cash in her apartment.
A junkie will do a lot for 5 grand.
Yeah. Yeah, I like that thinking.
I mean, I don't like that thinking.
I got it.
Okay.
Nina just cracked Lianne's phone.
There are lots of texts from a Tom Hobert.
Every other word is "Baby."
So he was her boyfriend.
Oh, yeah. There are months of these.
But they end four weeks ago.
Oh, right before she torched my apartment.
Okay.
So, we need to talk to Mr. Hobert.
It's Maura.
Okay, I'll be right down.
‭We'll take care of Hobert.
Okay, thanks.
You have an address for this Hobert?
Working on it.
You rang?
Ish.
I have a surprise for you.
Oh, no, Dr. Frankenstein, you shouldn't have.
The fire inspector
still had your door in the evidence locker.
I was thinking about what you said
about having a very good lock, so I brought it here,
and you did, and it was picked.
Well, they had to get in somehow.
The teeth are even.
They bumped my lock?
They struck the lock.
They withdrew. They repeated.
They struck again until all of the tumblers were open.
This is a very sophisticated lock-picking technique.
Which rules out a drug addict with no B&E priors.
Yeah, but we're dealing with
someone smart and motivated, jane.
I'm worried about you.
I'd worry about the person who bumped my lock when I find them.
Jane...
Nobody bumps my lock, Maura.
Thanks for coming.
I'm kind of curious why
you didn't want Jane to know I was here.
I've drawn up a psychological profile
on the person who's after her.
The arsonist?
The person who hired the arsonist
and possibly the hacker.
You've ruled out Lianne Sampson?
Yes.
So, this individual has access to money.
They're very good at manipulating people,
very smart, and very unpredictable.
You think Jane's in danger?
I think jane needs a bodyguard,
which I will pay for myself.
Have you told her that?
No.
Look, Maura...
I understand your concern. I share your concern.
Excellent. So, this is the list of
bodyguards that come highly recommended.
They killed Lianne Sampson.
Yes, and Jane is my best chance of finding them.
I'm not taking her out of commission.
That would be counterproductive.
Thank you.
How did you meet Lianne?
We started dating in rehab.
You're not supposed to date people from rehab.
You're not supposed to step on a crack
'cause you'll break your mother's back, but you do.
We were good together, you know?
She was an all-right chick.
Then what?
There was a new guy, some dick.
But with money.
Boyfriend?
Lianne said she was working for him.
You didn't believe her?
She wouldn't tell me what she was doing for the money.
She wouldn't even tell me his name.
Did she tell you what he did or how he looked or where he lived?
No.
Not a curious guy, are you?
Doesn't matter, all the details.
She was gonna start using again.
You know what you call an ex-junkie with cash?
A junkie.
Hobert?
This was fun. Let's not do it again.
Hi, ma. What's up?
You tell me.
I do not have the time for this today.
Something wrong?
No, nothing's wrong. I'm just busy.
Uh, y-you didn't call me.
I'm sorry.
Uh, I-I didn't know that you called.
Jane, you know what the silver cord is?
If I pull it, will you disappear so I can go back to work?
Ah, you're funny, Jane.
No, it's the connection between
a mother and her child that's always there.
Right.
Yes, I remember seeing something about that on a show...
or a birthday card.
Mm. It lets a mother know when there's trouble -- like now.
There's no trouble.
No?
No.
It's Maura. It's important. I got to go.
Yeah, sure.
Okay, I'll just worry for the both of us.
Okay.
I love you.
I love you, too, ma.
There were five balloons of cocaine
in Lianne Sampson's stomach.
So she was a mule?
Maybe.
No room for "maybe."
I took pictures of the balloons, and I had them blown up.
Unusual.
All five balloons had
a perfectly cylindrical puncture under the lip.
So they were supposed to leak?
Yes.
Well, there are easier,
less-expensive ways to kill someone.
It appears the person who killed her doesn't care about money.
That's strange. Especially for drug dealers.
Even stranger, there was a sixth balloon with less cocaine,
but it made room for the watch.
"The watch"?
A small watch for a girl or a woman,
and the battery was removed.
So it could be set for a specific time.
5:26.
Doesn't tell us much.
Well, it's within a half-hour of my estimated time of death.
It's clever, but still...
There's also a date -- the 26th.
That's tomorrow.
And this is my watch.
We have until 5:26 p.m. tomorrow.
Finding whoever killed Lianne Sampson
is your first priority.
It's your only priority.
This watch is a ticking clock.
Non-ticking clock.
It's a message.
Whoever put this in Lianne Sampson's stomach
wanted us to find it.
Nina?
Detective Rizzoli's apartment burned down.
Then someone accessed her financials,
but they didn't steal anything.
They just used that crime to send us a video,
which showed that the apartment fire was arson.
Lianne Sampson is murdered,
and we're given a watch with a time and a date.
Every piece of this, we've been one step behind.
That stops right now.
Nobody goes home. Nobody sleeps.
Every lead, every thought, every whisper comes through me.
That clear? Is that clear?
What the hell's going on?
I am not gonna be pushed out of
an investigation that involves me.
It's because it involves you that you can't be involved.
That doesn't even make sense.
Look, I can't conduct an investigation
into whoever's targeting you
and keep you safe from them at the same time!
I never asked you to keep me safe!
Well, you should!
This guy is willing to kill an accomplice
just to leave a clue as to what might happen next!
Which could be anything!
It's your watch, Jane!
Excuse me. We're in the middle of something here, all right?
So is he.
Detective Jane Rizzoli, this is your bodyguard.
Boris Martin.
Oh, come on!
Normally, a cop's in danger,
I put them in protective custody.
Whoever's targeting you -- they're anticipating normal.
The department is paying for a bodyguard?!
You have a bodyguard. Focus on what's important.
Nice to meet you.
Take her home, Mr. Martin.
Oh, come on!
Really?
Hi, Gary.
Tell me about your living arrangements.
I, uh, live with my brother.
It's temporary.
Well, he'll have to move till this is over.
Finally, some good news.
You okay?
Yeah, fine.
Look, you don't have to save Jane by yourself.
You didn't have to pay for that bodyguard.
Tell me -- tell me how the, um, investigation's going.
Well, I-I questioned every resident in that halfway house,
and it's just like the scummy ex-boyfriend said.
Lianne Sampson had a new guy, but no one's seen him.
He's a ghost, so dead end.
Oh, a-and the balloons
that you pulled out of Lianne's stomach...
...are from a shoe store that closed down eight years ago.
I-I keep running headfirst into a wall
and hoping the wall gives.
Well, you're doing the best that you can.
That's not enough.
He could still get to Jane.
No, he won't.
Yeah, but he might.
I have to figure out something else to do,
but I don't know what that is yet.
‭I don't know. Maybe, um...
Maybe he's not a he.
Maybe.
Wait.
Yeah.
If that's true, there's one place I haven't checked yet.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
What are you doing?
Uh, I was just cleaning out the room for you.
Just one more trip, I should be done.
Thank you?
I can protect you better in there.
What, from light, from air?
Someone is trying to disrupt
your normal patterns of behavior --
Where you live, how you spend, how you work.
In this apartment,
I can create a bulwark of stability and predictability.
Huh, just what I've always wanted.
This will pass.
I'll make sure you're around to achieve your dreams,
whatever those are.
‭Thanks. I appreciate that.
What are you doing?
I'm making my dreams of a pizza a reality.
It was thwarted earlier today.
No deliveries.
But I'm hungry.
I'll cook.
Pizza?
Dreams die hard.
Frankie!
Hiya, son.
Hey, ma.
Hey, I, uh... I got to go.
I thought your shift was over?
Something came up.
Something with Jane?
I can't talk about it.
I do have a gun.
So?
Ma...
Someone's after Jane, but it's okay.
I'm on it. We're all on it.
You all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I-I'm okay.
I got to go.
There's nothing good in here.
Don't read the front page. Go to sports.
I started with sports.
How's the pizza coming?
It's been over 15 minutes. It should be free.
Grilled Moroccan chicken.
It smells like angels.
I hope you like it. It was simple, really.
I found a chicken breast in the fridge
and combined some spices from the pantry.
It tastes like...
I don't want to say that I would eat an angel.
But if it tasted like this, I could live with myself.
Thank you!
You're welcome. I love to cook.
This job is so unpredictable -- the hours, the personalities.
I like the measured predictability of cooking.
I like it, too -- very much.
Jane?
Who is it?
Very dangerous. Don't let her in.
Jane?
Who is it?
My mother.
Hello? Jane?
Who are you?!
I can't protect you.
Open up!
Hi. Come on in.
I'm Boris, a work friend of Jane's.
Hi. Angela Rizzoli. Nice to meet ya.
Hi, ma!
Hi.
I know you got that work thing going on,
so I just came to drop this off.
I thought you might be hungry.
Yes! We are.
Thank you.
It smells fantastic.
Lasagna -- my mother's recipe.
It'll make that six-pack into a five.
I'm in. I like her.
Oh, I-I do, too.
Ah, so, I-I'm sure you -- you have a few questions.
About what?
Oh, about that secret work-operation thing?
N-no, I've learned it's none of my business.
R-really? Well, um,
'cause -- 'cause, you know, everything's fine.
Oh, well, I figured.
Oh. Yeah, um, you good?
Good.
She's good?
Great.
Everything's good!
Okay, so, you can put that in the fridge
and heat that up later, and Jane?
It'll go very nicely with a glass of red wine...
and don't forget the napkins.
Yes, ma'am.
‭Can't wait to try the lasagna.
Yeah, good.
Boris, work friend of Jane
if something happens to my daughter, I'll kill you dead.
Now, give a kiss to mama.
Give it up.
Is she gone?
Yeah.
She really is something, though, isn't she?
Yes, she is.
You didn't answer the question.
What was the question?
How is this you staying out of the investigation?
Because I'm not asking about the murder.
You're asking about people who might be following you.
Nina...
Tell her.
I pulled BPD surveillance footage from before the fire,
like you asked.
The same guy was right behind you when you left BPD --
twice.
Send me a screenshot.
Just did -- to your phone.
He works in the building.
His name is Frank Conte. He's a good guy.
Sorry, just --
Grasping at straws?
It's all right. We all are.
Get some sleep, okay?
I plan to -- around 5:27.
If she asks about anything more,
you might want to let Korsak know.
Sure.
I figured.
So, you don't know of any women who knew Lianne Sampson?
I wish I could be of more help.
My interaction with individual inmates is limited,
unless their stay here is problematic.
Lianne Sampson was a model prisoner.
But here's the man who can help.
Hi. Joe Harris, prison psychiatrist.
Detective Frank Rizzoli.
Joe, please assist the detective any way you can.
You can talk here.
Thanks.
I, uh...I heard about Lianne's death.
Tragic. She seemed to be on such a good path.
Uh, she was your patient?
Yeah, more for counseling than anything.
She wanted guidance on how to live a better life.
And you gave that to her?
It's part of an inmate's preparation for release
if they request it.
I listened.
I helped her let go of her past,
steered her towards books and support groups.
Then she was gone.
Did Lianne have any regular visitors?
You can check the logs but none that I know of.
Ties to any guards?
No.
And what about other inmates?
No, Lianne stayed mostly to herself.
She had been here before.
She was determined never to come back again.
Uh, one more thing.
Did she ever mention a detective Rizzoli?
No.
But why would she mention you?
No reason.
Thanks for your time.
Sure.
Thank you all for your cooperation.
We'll get you back in your apartments as soon as we can.
I have an area set up over here.
They're moving Frankie's neighbors.
Gonna be so popular in this building.
Get away from the window.
Hey. My phone died.
What are you doing?
Charging your phone with my car.
This car has a special feature --
Yeah, I'm so glad. Tell me about it later.
Bomb-sniffing dog.
Sure everyone feels safe now.
Window!
All right!
Circle around the back.
How you doing?
Now I know what a prisoner feels like.
Yeah, time goes slow when there's nothing to do.
Be over soon.
I've got 5:25.
Me too.
Me three.
Where's Korsak?
5:27.
Yep.
Jane...
And that's correct. I synch to greenwich mean time.
In an hour, I think we can have you out of here.
But I don't want you leaving the ap--
Wait a minute.
The numbers are digital.
Yeah?
They look like letters.
Or a code.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where are you going?
No, no, no, I got to get to BPD.
No. The watch is not a clock.
It's not a clock. I got to get to BPD.
Jane!
I'm on my way.
Whoa, whoa. Wh-- hey.
No. No, no, no, no, no, no!
Korsak, I got to get to the station.
Back inside.
No, listen to me.
526, okay? It's -- it's -- it's a message.
Nothing this man has done has been straightforward, all right?
When he burned down my apartment,
he didn't leave a message.
He left it buried in some computer file
that Nina had to find, okay?
The watch is not a ticking clock!
What is this -- a mixed metaphor?
A simile? I'm a little tired for wordplay.
5-2-6.
It's not a time. It's a code or a message.
Okay, I'll get everybody to work on that.
Would you please escort her back upstairs?
No! Kors-- wait a minute!
Hold up, hold up.
No! Listen to me!
It is a message, and it is a message for me!
Please!
It's 5:29.
He'll be expecting her guard down.
Please.
All right, let's get her back to the station.
She's the worst client ever.
What do you see?
Somebody...
trying to rip apart my life.
What do you think the watch means?
526 -- street address on 26th street?
Maybe an area code?
Well, then what does the 26 stand for?
There's no 526.26th street in Boston.
Surprise.
Code for a safe?
But where's the safe?
Could be map coordinates.
Or it could be nothing.
There's got to be something to this --
All this work, a woman killed to set a deadline.
Which passed, and then nothing happened.
How do we know nothing's happened, Frankie?
Nobody's told us anything.
All right, quit throwing up roadblocks.
You don't want to be here, then don't be here!
I'll follow up on all these combinations of 526 and 26.
Okay.
I'm gonna grab a coffee. You want anything?
No, thanks.
Hey, ma!
Hi.
What's going on?
Nothing.
Not even a sip?
Something's up.
This whole thing with Jane, it...
No, I shouldn't. Forget about it.
No, you should.
You should talk about it because if you don't, I will.
And if I start, I'm never stopping.
I've been taking every available shift
just to keep my mind off of it.
Jane doesn't realize how worried I am about her.
Well, you don't know how to be when you're scared for Jane.
Exactly.
And Jane doesn't know how to be when she's scared for Jane.
Yeah.
Look, you're all under a lot of pressure.
I got to go.
I'm on triple platinum overtime from all these shifts.
Finish your beer, relax, and then just get back at it.
I'll trade you for a cup of coffee.
You got it.
You look tired.
You want to rest on my couch? I can go work in the lab.
No, no, no.
I'll just lay here and think.
About?
Oh, I don't know.
Hate letters and...
Revenge e-mails and...
Arson and hacking and murder and a watch and...
I don't know.
Well, take a guess.
Don't be me.
I just don't know if it's worth it, you know?
Putting together the clues?
No. The -- the job.
Your job?
Yeah, just...
...the stress of it all for everybody, you know?
Me.
Ma, frankie.
Don't you ever feel like doing something else?
Something that doesn't involve dead bodies?
Sure, I'd like to get an engineering degree
and work for Elon Musk on SpaceX.
Or move to Maine and write mystery novels.
Sometimes I imagine being the person who makes up
the names for colors in the J.Crew catalogues.
You know...
faded ebony
or dusty cobblestone, neon persimmon.
You?
No, I can't think of any other life.
Well, that's not true.
It is.
I mean, I could always see more Red Sox games, but...
I can do that now with better planning.
You're in the middle of a crisis.
And contrary to the world view
of romance novels or Elizabeth Gilbert,
right now is not a good time to make decisions.
Who's Elizabeth Gilbert?
"Eat, Pray, Love."
Oh, God.
Maybe it would help if you lean into the discomfort.
In the same way you lean into your stilettos?
Yes.
Except for, the leaning in you're about to do
doesn't make your butt look great.
It doesn't make anything look great.
Okay.
I will let you get back to work.
No, Jane. Come on. Stay.
No, I'm good.
Jane?
I'm okay.
Really.
What are you doing?
Everything else is in the past.
So is the watch.
Yeah, but it means something with the 5-2-6-2-6.
5 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 6?
5-2-6.
Dash 2...
Nina, in the bottom-left drawer, there's -- there's a bible.
Can you grab that for me, please?
Oh, beautiful.
My mom got me one like this when I got into the academy.
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua,
Judges, Ruth, 1 and 2 Samuel,
1 and 2 Kings, 1 and 2 Chron --
No, it, uh -- it would be in the New Testament.
Matthew, Mark, Luke, John,
something -- something like, uh,
like you would hear in church.
You know, something, um...
Matthew5 verse26.
"Truly I tell you,
you will not get out until you have paid the last penny."
That's what this is about. It's about revenge.
That's why he's taken everything.
The question's still, who?
And w-what?
He's taken everything. There's nothing left to take.
You're safe here, Jane.
No one's gonna get to you.
The watch.
Uh, the watch...
watch was a gift. On the back of it...
was engraved "Love, Ma."
It's going to voicemail.
I'll call the Dirty Robber.
Tell them I'm on my way.
Okay.
Hey, Janie, I'm glad you called.
Ma's the target!
What?
Get to the Dirty Robber!
I-I'm here. She went home already.
Okay, um uh,
go to Maura's house, but take the route that she would take.
And if you see her, stop her and stay with her.
Ma, it's me. Call me when you get this.
‭We got to get to Maura's. He's after Ma.
How do you know? - Uh, 5:26 is a --
it's a bible verse about taking everything.
And what if you reverse it? 26-526.
That's the penal code for kidnapping.
Isles.
Homicide?
I'm on my way.
Ma?
Ma?
Oh, my!
It's okay! It's okay! It's me!
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
You almost gave me a heart attack!
I've been calling you!
I was running a bath!
What is going on?
Somebody's been harassing me.
Yeah, I-I know.
What do you know?
Frankie told me.
Okay, you know what?!
He shouldn't have done that, Ma!
No, he had every right.
He was worried, and...
