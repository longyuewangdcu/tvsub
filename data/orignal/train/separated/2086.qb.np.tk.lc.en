dad .
seriously ?
it &apos;s , like , 6 : 00 in the morning .
well , it &apos;s 6 : 15,
you said you wanted to get up early to study ,
so this is me waking you .
yeah , early ,
not the butt crack of dawn .
where are you ?
oh , we talked about this , bud .
i have a big meeting this morning .
oh . right .
okay . you know , everyone &apos;s been asking me
if i &apos;m going on the kahana camping trip .
evan , i don &apos;t know if i feel comfortable you going
camping without supervision .
jordan &apos;s uncle &apos;s gonna be there .
well , i don &apos;t know jordan &apos;s uncle , evan .
dad , he &apos;s a librarian .
how dangerous can he be ?
okay , i &apos;ll tell you what .
you ace this test , and then we &apos;ll talk
about kahana valley , okay ?
you &apos;re such a dictator .
i know . i &apos;m the worst dad ever .
dad ?
tell me what &apos;s that ?
talk to me , dad . what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s that noise ?
what is that ?
no ! no , no , no !
dad ?
when he was five years old ,
i asked my son steve what he wanted to be when he grew up .
he said , &quot; i want to be a cop , dad , like you . &quot;
i told him to be anything but that .
the life of a cop is ... is not easy .
it &apos;s not that i &apos;m not proud of the work that i did ,
but more than anything , i have , uh ...
i have regrets .
the toll that it took on my family , the way it hurt them .
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s something i think about every day .
now i &apos;m , uh ...
i &apos;m alone here .
losing my wife was almost unbearable .
but giving up my kids , that , uh ...
that just broke me .
i &apos;m so proud of them ,
but they &apos;d never know it .
i &apos;ve missed so much of their lives , you know ,
watching them grow up and all .
i guess that &apos;s the way it has to be ,
till i figure this out .
what is it with you and walking into people &apos;s houses ?
well , i knocked .
i didn &apos;t hear you knock .
well , i did ,
i knocked , and then i saw you through the window
and i thought you nodded .
didn &apos;t nod .
would you like me to leave ?
depends . what &apos;s in the bag ?
oh , those , doughnut @-@ looking things they sell around the block .
malasadas ?
yeah , whatever they are .
they &apos;re fried and they taste good . you want one ?
no . not without bypass surgery .
and you can stay .
just don &apos;t eat near my stuff .
can i have a napkin ?
yeah .
what was that look ? what , they teach you
how not to spill in the army ?
it &apos;s the navy , okay ? the navy .
it &apos;s not the spill .
it &apos;s the tie .
no one in hawaii wears a tie .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , i like to look like a professional .
professional what ?
okay , this is my favorite tie .
grace gave me this tie for father &apos;s day .
oh , and also , so you know , back in jersey
and every normal city in this country ,
this is what a detective looks like .
really ?
yeah , really .
yeah , shirt , tie , doughnut crumbs .
you missed a spot .
look , you &apos;re never gonna fit in here
looking like you &apos;re from the mainland .
who says i want to fit in ?
i don &apos;t want to fit in , i want to look like
i &apos;m from the mainland . okay ?
i got 87 homicide cases
under my belt looking like this .
not in 110 @-@ degree weather , you don &apos;t .
i &apos;m just saying .
i &apos;m not taking off the tie .
fine .
so leave it alone .
okay .
okay ?
you want to discuss my shoes ?
well , now that you mention it ,
patent leather loafers ?
will you , uh , do me a favor , please ?
just let it go .
is that your dad &apos;s stuff ?
yeah .
you get anything from it ?
more questions than answers .
talk to the coast guard ?
yeah .
uh , they didn &apos;t find victor hesse &apos;s body yet .
that does not mean that they won &apos;t .
what if he &apos;s alive ?
you emptied a mag into the guy .
right .
he &apos;s fish food .
look , admiral shepard knows that this is
the guy that killed your father .
he &apos;s got crews on it 24 / 7 .
they will find hesse &apos;s body .
yes , governor .
kidnapping victim &apos;s name is roland lowry .
his car was t @-@ boned an hour ago .
gunshots were exchanged , passengers were killed .
this all happened in broad daylight .
well , that seems like a pretty messy grab
just to yank an ordinary guy off the streets .
this guy &apos;s not ordinary .
lowry &apos;s ex @-@ nsa .
he used to have top @-@ secret security clearance .
which means his abduction could be
a serious national security threat .
right .
what else the governor say ?
she said , &quot; find him . &quot;
hey , got your message .
good . come on , let &apos;s start processing .
governor &apos;s task force . we &apos;ll take it from here .
chin , kono , stay on the suv . danny and i are on the van .
officer lee .
north winds must be coming in early ; i just got a chill .
you know , i trained that guy
and now he can &apos;t even look me in the eye .
forget him , cousin .
my police academy graduation dinner &apos;s
at haleiwa joe &apos;s , 7 : 30 .
can you make it ?
i &apos;ll try .
car was a rental .
come on , you &apos;re gonna make it
to my graduation , right ?
you know , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s such a good idea .
between our family and hpd ...
i don &apos;t care what they think .
you &apos;re the reason i became a cop .
well , a ceremony doesn &apos;t make a cop .
doing the job makes a cop .
i want you there .
no , you don &apos;t . they think i &apos;m dirty , kono .
they &apos;re gonna paint you with the same brush .
i &apos;m doing this for you .
stay on the car . i &apos;m gonna go pull the footage
from that traffic camera , see if it got anything .
ss @-@ 190 armor @-@ piercing rounds .
these guys were definitely well @-@ backed .
definitely not a local job .
what do you got ?
this van-- reported stolen two days ago .
two dead guys in the suv ,
hired muscle from bruddah &apos;s private security firm .
that &apos;s interesting .
why &apos;s it interesting ?
this is density @-@ layer ballistic glass ,
laminated onto a shield of resilient polycarbonate .
why can &apos;t you just say &quot; bulletproof &quot; ?
i mean , how hard is that ?
get chin to call
the security company , find out where they were going .
guys , roland &apos;s last call was 6 : 15 a.m.
same time he was abducted . who did he call ?
his son , evan .
we got a witness .
evan , do you know where your dad was going this morning ?
no .
i mean , he probably told me , but i was only half listening .
it was some big meeting .
do you know what it was about ?
look , we don &apos;t really talk about his work .
did your dad ever have any disagreements with anyone ?
is there anybody that you can think of
that &apos;d want to hurt your dad ?
no . i &apos;m telling you , he &apos;s the most
boring person you &apos;ll ever meet .
what about your mom ? where &apos;s she ?
she died when i was seven .
all right , buddy , look .
there was two other men with your dad this morning .
they were bodyguards .
you have any idea why he would hire bodyguards ?
seriously ?
yeah .
bodyguards ?
n @-@ no , i have no clue .
i can &apos;t believe it .
that could &apos;ve been the last time i ever talk to my dad .
and i called him a dictator .
evan .
you all right ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
you okay ?
god , you must have been so scared .
i can &apos;t even imagine it .
you know , you &apos;re gonna come and stay with me
until they find him , yeah ?
okay .
who &apos;s that ?
name &apos;s natalie reed . she &apos;s roland &apos;s girlfriend .
she have any guess who &apos;d want to grab her boyfriend ?
no idea .
all right , stay close . if this is a kidnap and ransom ,
then the abductors might try to make contact ,
and if they do , i want someone who can run the trace .
okay .
hey , listen .
give us a couple hours , we &apos;ll run down some leads .
we will relieve you .
i promise you , you won &apos;t miss your graduation .
it &apos;s cool , brah .
grabbed the video footage from a traffic cam near the crime scene .
i &apos;ll mine it , see if there &apos;s anything
on there that can help us identify the shooters .
did you get in touch with the security company
that roland hired today ?
yeah , i spoke to the owner .
turns out , roland hired the bodyguards
for an appointment he had this morning .
where were they going ?
hickam air force base .
you know anyone at hickam ?
a stupid question . of course you do .
roland became paranoid .
firing off memos in the middle of the night
directly to the joint chiefs of staff .
which pissed off his immediate superiors to no end .
what were the memos about ?
he was constantly telling us how vulnerable we were to attack .
in fact , he moved to hawaii not to retire ,
but to carry on with his work .
he felt this is where he could do the most good .
what does that mean ?
hawaii &apos;s in a strategic position in the global theater .
and that the united states pacific command
is directly responsible for 150 million square miles .
literally half the earth .
why do you think pearl harbor was a target ?
is that why he wanted to see you ?
&apos;cause he felt we were still vulnerable ?
and he said he was working on something that could prove it .
okay , what was it ?
he didn &apos;t feel comfortable talking about it over the phone ,
so he was bringing it over today .
so roland was about to expose some serious threat to the island .
that &apos;s why i took the meeting .
that &apos;s why he was kidnapped .
mcgarrett .
steve we &apos;ve got a wounded runner
injured in the gunfight .
the tape shows he was hit in the grab
and he went into the kahiko on kalia road .
hotel security cameras show
he went up the elevator on the right .
he was shot . knew he couldn &apos;t go to the hospital .
he &apos;s looking for a place to hide and heal .
i got blood .
he went up .
he &apos;s on 36 .
uh , we &apos;re cops . don &apos;t worry .
you like hippos ?
i like hippos , too .
i got a daughter-- she loves hippos . everybody likes hippos .
he &apos;ll be okay .
go . go .
you have an amazing way with children .
what ?
here ! here !
clear .
clear .
he &apos;s on the roof .
found him .
is he dead ?
not yet .
have a nice nap , princess ?
who are you ?
huh ?
the man asked you a question .
where &apos;s roland lowry ?
what do you want with him ?
hey , you know , i &apos;ve been shot , too .
yeah , you really ought to get that looked at .
what &apos;s it been , an hour or two since you got hit ?
what &apos;s gonna happen is bacterial infection is gonna set in ,
and trust me , you do not want that .
it goes straight to your bloodstream .
sepsis , organ failure . next thing you know ,
they &apos;re yanking out your kidneys .
and from what i hear ,
dialysis is , um , it &apos;s not fun .
let me ask you a question .
your buddies really worth all that trouble ?
huh ? i mean , you guys couldn &apos;t have been that tight , right ?
they left you behind .
danno , move .
chin , hold him down .
what are you doing ?
what is the matter with you ?
give me a piece of paper .
run that print .
let &apos;s go .
hey , hey , steve , what do you think you &apos;re doing ? hey !
are you out of your mind ? !
you want to play , huh ?
let &apos;s play .
this is not guantanamo .
you can &apos;t hang a guy off the roof .
all i &apos;d have to say is that you came at me with a gun ,
we struggled and you fell .
what do you think of that , huh ?
hey , hey , hey !
hey , listen to me , listen to me .
if a suspect dies , he no longer has the ability to speak .
ergo , he &apos;s useless to us .
you think anybody &apos;s gonna care ?
you just killed two people , buddy .
i &apos;d be doing the world a favor .
that &apos;s enough !
ladies ...
you can stop now .
i got a fingerprint match off an interpol database .
ergo ?
you and i are going to have a long talk
later , you understand ? get him up !
the guy &apos;s name is sergei ivanovich .
serbian national with a rap sheet a mile long .
he &apos;s part of a gang who pulled mostly bank jobs , jewelry heists .
smash and grab type stuff .
thieves . thieves take things , not humans .
maybe they graduated to kidnapping .
or maybe they knew what roland wanted to show the general ,
and they want to get their hands on it .
either way , take this guy to the office , throw him in a hole .
then i want you to run deep background .
find out when sergei got to the island , where he &apos;s been ,
all known associates , the whole shot .
got it .
where you going ?
we are going to roland &apos;s house , okay ?
these guys are thieves-- i want to know what they were after .
that way , you &apos;re going ?
shut up .
let it go . just let it go .
please do not speak to me right now .
okay , so we &apos;re gonna do that whole thing again ? why do we ... ?
will you zip it for a second ? i &apos;m gonna speak now .
it is my turn .
sergei ivanovich-- he is a suspect .
that means we treat him as a source of information
and then we book him , okay ? torturing and killing
is not part of the job description .
i wasn &apos;t going to kill him .
why are you talking ?
i &apos;m just trying to explain ...
why are your lips moving ? !
go ahead .
i know the governor gave you a free pass , okay ?
but immunity and means does not entitle you
to hang a guy off a roof .
all right , i was going to break ivanovich .
i just needed a little time to get into his head .
that is how police work is done .
is that too theoretical for you , huh ?
can i speak ?
please !
okay .
that guy was only going to talk out of fear of death .
fear of death ?
fear of death .
what does that mean , fear of death ?
people will tell you anything under fear of death .
that doesn &apos;t necessarily make it true .
did you see the tattoo on his hand ?
what ?
the blue star-- did you see the blue star tattoo
he had on his hand ?
that &apos;s a new belgrade serbian mafia tattoo .
these guys are not smash and grab types .
they kill kids .
they slaughter families .
that boy &apos;s going to lose his father .
is everything going to become a personal mission for you ?
you hang a guy off a roof because you lost your father ?
danny , you know what ... ?
no , no , no , no , no . i swear to god , i just want to know .
i want to know , because if everything is going to become
a personal mission to you-- okay , i count my odds
at job security , not to mention survival ,
pretty slim .
okay ? we are partners .
so if you are going to be the shoot first
and ask questions later type of a guy ,
i would at least like to be consulted
so i know when to duck .
okay .
okay .
just for the record , i wasn &apos;t going to kill him .
well , that is good .
got security cameras , double dead bolts ,
two separate entrances .
where &apos;s the automatic gun turrets ?
evan was right .
roland does take his personal security seriously .
yeah , well , it &apos;s living proof-- just because you &apos;re paranoid
doesn &apos;t meant they &apos;re not out to get you .
all right , we &apos;re looking for files ,
notebooks , his computer .
oh , thank you , inspector obvious .
i &apos;ll check the back .
fall asleep with your eyes open again ?
that &apos;s funny . this wall seem weird to you ?
i &apos;m not an architect , but there should be another room here .
this is slightly above my level of expertise .
what are you doing ? no , no , don &apos;t touch it .
don &apos;t ... no , no , no .
good . you just put a blip in the matrix .
we need to find someone who can make sense of this .
you were naval intelligence .
none of this looks familiar to you ?
no , i ... look , i &apos;ve seen super @-@ grade level cryptography
before , but this isn &apos;t it .
this is-- this is something else .
this is like off the grid hacker world .
hacker ? i think i know a guy
who can help us .
you know a guy ?
yeah , i know a guy . i know people , too .
okay .
you got any cash on you ?
how &apos;d you say you know this guy ?
his name is adam charles .
first case i worked when i got here six months ago ,
he got busted hacking into atms
all around the island . basically a good kid .
he just got caught up with some knuckleheads ,
and they were using him for his skill set .
right , and your heart just bled for him ?
no . i , uh ... just put a good word in with the judge .
i mean , this kid had a scholarship to mit ,
the whole nine .
he &apos;s really a ... a genius--
at least 42 minutes of the day .
what about the rest of the time ?
baked like a potato .
ah . pakalolo .
yeah , he says it helps him
see patterns , and all codes are basically patterns .
oh , my .
dessert before dinner .
hey , jersey .
aloha .
toast .
you &apos;re looking all kama &apos;aina .
it &apos;s the tie , right ?
really sells it .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
uh , we need a favor , toast .
grab your stuff . we &apos;re going for a ride .
evan , you got to eat something .
hey , kono . we found one of the men who grabbed roland .
he give you anything ?
no , but we found out he &apos;s part
of a gang of serbian thieves .
i &apos;ll e @-@ mail you a picture .
listen , you think you can talk to evan ?
ask him if he knows this guy
or anything about his dad &apos;s business .
international contacts , overseas phone calls ,
anything that might be able to tie roland to the serbs .
yeah , sure , i &apos;ll try .
how &apos;s the kid doing ?
about as well as can be expected , considering .
how about you ?
i &apos;m fine . why ?
well , you &apos;re cutting it kind of close .
you might miss your graduation .
no worries .
you become a cop by doing the work ,
not walking across a stage , right ?
good news is , you &apos;re off the hook .
you don &apos;t have to be there .
well , good luck with the kid .
thanks .
any news ?
nothing concrete .
he won &apos;t eat . he won &apos;t talk .
i &apos;m really worried about him .
do you have any paper ?
oh , your kidnapped dude &apos;s got a sweet setup .
yo , take your time , toast .
i mean , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s ... it &apos;s just national security .
i &apos;ll take my time and do it right .
can i smoke in here , guys ?
no .
no .
harsh .
no way .
this is unreal .
like unicorn style .
i mean , i &apos;ve heard rumors about this guy online ,
but i thought it was all just urban legend .
he really did it .
did what ? what did he do ?
okay . he built a skeleton key .
it &apos;s basically a worm
that can bypass asymmetric encryption
on high @-@ grade security networks ,
and also allows remote access to infrastructure systems .
great .
you want to dumb it down for my friend here ?
just look .
wait , wait , wait .
that &apos;s a rendering of the power grid
of the entire island of oahu .
and the radar array for honolulu international airport .
what did roland do ?
i don &apos;t know .
but you &apos;re talking about places with heavy @-@ grade
asymmetric encryption , and your boy here hacked them .
all with this computer , roland did that ?
no .
i mean , this is all just archives--
logs of what he did .
skeleton key &apos;s definitely not on these drives .
my guess is ...
it was right in there .
okay .
at least we know what he wanted to show general nathanson--
the skeleton key and what it could do .
okay , so hold on-- if roland can hack
into the island infrastructure ,
any government network computer ...
then whoever has him can do the same .
what are you making ?
a crane .
in japan , it &apos;s a symbol of peace ,
honor and loyalty .
i once had to make 1,000 of them
for my cousin &apos;s wedding in kyoto .
whoa . 1,000 ?
yeah . it &apos;s kind of a thing .
you ever , uh , been out of the country ?
no . we never go anywhere .
hawaii &apos;s the farthest from virginia we &apos;ve ever been .
do you , um ...
do you recognize this guy ?
no .
is he the man who took my dad ?
we think he &apos;s one of them , yes .
we got him .
and we &apos;ll get the others , i promise you .
do you think i could try to make one of those ?
i &apos;d love to teach you .
let me get a piece of paper .
sergei flew in from serbia two months ago .
alone ?
no .
he came in with a drago zankovic .
he &apos;s the boss , as far as i can tell .
he , uh , paid for the tickets .
they both traveled on doctored passports .
there were three guys on the traffic cab .
let &apos;s go a little further back .
show me all serbian passports in hawaii
in the last six months .
yeah , one sec .
hey , natalie , do you have another piece of paper ?
in the top drawer .
i just put some water on for tea .
do you want some ?
yeah , sure .
blow that one up .
nadia lukovic .
aka natalie .
everything okay ?
yeah , everything &apos;s fine .
evan &apos;s okay ?
yeah , he &apos;s hanging in there .
hey !
let her go .
i said let her go .
come on .
we &apos;re all going to take ride together .
turn left ahead .
you shouldn &apos;t have involved the boy .
well , you should have done a better job .
you could have convinced him to sell it on the open market .
more time ? it &apos;s been months .
he was about to hand it over to the u.s. military .
you &apos;ve been watching my dad for months ?
it &apos;s my boss .
if i don &apos;t answer ,
he &apos;ll know something &apos;s wrong .
tell him everything is fine ,
or the boy won &apos;t see his next birthday .
steve .
kono , am i on speaker ?
no .
natalie &apos;s working with the serbs .
we &apos;re on the way to her house . where are you ?
yeah , everything &apos;s great .
copy that . just stay on the line
as long as you can . we &apos;re running a trace .
this is chin ho kelly . i need a priority trace .
kono , can you tell us where you are ?
yeah , i may even take evan out to mokuleia beach for a swim .
okay , you &apos;re headed north .
exactly .
i know what you &apos;re doing .
now , take a hard left .
dad !
evan .
no , dad !
natalie .
what are you doing ?
she &apos;s one of them , dad !
no .
no , no ! no , that can &apos;t be !
oh , shut up !
you see , your father has not been very cooperative ,
but now , with you here ,
maybe you can talk some sense into him , huh ?
tell him to do what we ask .
all right , all right .
all right , all right . you win .
i &apos;ll do what you want .
just please , don &apos;t hurt my son !
dad !
leave him alone !
shut up !
sit down !
okay . okay .
come on .
okay , okay .
come on .
now , get to work .
no , no , no , no , no .
yeah , toast , what &apos;s up ?
jersey , look ,
i don &apos;t want to freak you out , but ...
ho , ho , ho , ho , ho . take the lollipop out of your mouth .
i can &apos;t understand a word .
look , i don &apos;t want
to freak you out , but it looks like
the skeleton key just went live .
okay . what does that mean ?
someone &apos;s using it , dude .
no , no , no .
that &apos;s problematic .
what is problematic ?
the radar just went down .
can we trace the hack ?
no , i can &apos;t pinpoint the origin .
whatever it is just took down
the honolulu approach radar .
why do that ?
so someone can fly in or out undetected .
make sure the radar is down until they land .
got it ?
what are they making him do ?
as soon as he &apos;s done ,
do you think they &apos;ll let us go ?
hey . i told you to be quiet .
hey , leave him alone .
leave him alone , scumbag .
nah , not yet . she &apos;s a good hostage .
my hostage !
get her back in the chair .
hey , get back to work .
you &apos;re dead .
it &apos;s just a matter of time .
sorry .
did you catch that ?
yeah , no markings , no tail number .
you were right . not one of ours .
okay , so where the hell did it come from ?
i don &apos;t know , but i think i know where it &apos;s going .
there &apos;s a skydiving school around here .
skydiving ?
that &apos;s right , there is .
it &apos;s gotta land somewhere , right ?
dillingham airfield . that &apos;s where they are .
where is it ?
let &apos;s see the money first .
looks ... looks like it &apos;s all here .
this way , gentlemen .
how are we taking the building ?
what do you think ?
i think if we can get our eyes on our people , we go in hot .
is that what you would do ?
yes , that is what i would do .
see ? this is a partnership .
it &apos;s like pulling teeth ,
you know that ?
come on .
let &apos;s go .
here it is , as you requested .
dad ?
yeah ?
i &apos;m sorry i called you a dictator .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
hey , both of you .
hey , listen to me . get ready
to hit the ground .
when ?
you &apos;ll know when . just do it .
you want to take her out ?
take her out .
everybody out now , now , now , now !
let &apos;s go ! let &apos;s go !
hey , hey !
eddie , eddie , eddie ,
i got you .
i got you .
hands up . hands up .
stand up .
hands behind your back .
i got you .
you had me worried
for a second there , cuz .
i had it all under control .
book him , danno .
really ? i mean , is that gonna be a thing now ?
you don &apos;t like it ?
don &apos;t like it .
i think it &apos;s catchy .
what are you looking at ? what &apos;s the matter with you ?
go ahead , walk , right this way .
a kel @-@ tec nine @-@ mil .
very nice .
makes for a good backup weapon .
keep it in your belt , your ankle strap .
doesn &apos;t need a separate holster .
thanks , boss .
i &apos;m sorry you were put in danger today .
we care for each other like a family ,
so please know we &apos;ll always do everything we can
to protect you .
he &apos;s the patron saint ...
... of law enforcement .
i &apos;ve seen cops wear &apos; em .
pretty sure with that
roundhouse kick you &apos;re never gonna need it .
my sergeant gave me one when i graduated from the academy .
i &apos;ve always kept it on me .
it &apos;s always kept me safe .
that is , until i met him .
