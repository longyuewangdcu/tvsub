第一季第二集
what is that , three in a row ?
that would be four , actually .
oh , god .
come on . what do you say , we go five outta nine ?
so you can keep abusing me ?
no , thank you . i &apos;m done .
oh , come on . i &apos;ll spot you three .
game time &apos;s over , wyatt . they &apos;re here .
they &apos;re here ?
you can set up in the conference room .
yeah . no , i &apos;m just ...
get set up in the conference room .
you did let him win , right ?
it wasn &apos;t easy .
the guy has the coordination of a two @-@ year @-@ old .
i know , the last time these venture capitalists came in ,
i took him boxing to calm him down .
i basically had to punch myself in the face to let him win .
i don &apos;t get it . i mean , if he &apos;s such a genius ,
why does he get so nervous around a bunch of investors ?
eh , you spend two years working on
a satellite phone that fits in your pocket
and then bet the company on it .
you &apos;d be a little nervous too , i think .
the prototype ...
i can &apos;t find it . i don &apos;t know where i--
you mean this ?
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;d do without you .
fail miserably .
i would .
is that the ...
$ 20 million prototype , yes .
and you don &apos;t even get to look at this bad boy
until after we close the deal today .
wow , they &apos;re like storm troopers .
storm troopers don &apos;t write checks .
now all you gotta do is walk in there ,
show them how the phone works ...
right , and suntech digital
will be a new force in global communications .
let &apos;s knock &apos; em dead .
all right .
wait , wait . where do you think you &apos;re going ?
into the room with the people .
wrong , that &apos;s the adult table in there .
and you haven &apos;t earned the privilege yet .
but i played air hockey with him--
you need to go back to the office
and file a patent for the phone .
a patent ? i don &apos;t know how to file a patent .
figure it out .
can &apos;t we do that after--
no , and you keep talking , i &apos;m gonna start billing you .
and my time runs $ 1,000 an hour .
but isn &apos;t this our time , mr. hand ?
i stand corrected .
your fast times at ridgemont high quote ,
that proves you belong at the adult table .
hey , that &apos;s a great movie .
and it spoke to a generation ...
hey , you busy ?
okay , have you ever filed a patent before ?
i just got back from this meeting with harvey
and he wants me to file this patent ,
but i have no idea what that paperwork looks like .
so ... any help in this arena would be re--
did harvey call you and tell you to do that ?
if it isn &apos;t the golden boy .
you &apos;re harvey &apos;s project , right ?
what &apos;s your name ?
mike , mike ross .
gregory boone .
so what are you doing here ?
weren &apos;t you signing some big deal this afternoon downtown ?
well , evidently i haven &apos;t earned the privilege yet .
get the adult table speech ?
yeah , instead of watching the deal close ,
i get to file the patent .
yeah , those suck .
wait , you-- you &apos;ve done one of these before ?
like 100 . why ?
now .
it &apos;s okay , you don &apos;t have to apologize .
i took care of it .
patent claim .
i negotiated a deal to get it done .
what are you talking about ?
gregory . he agreed to file it for me .
and all i have to do is proof his bainbridge briefs .
ah . that explains why he said to give you this .
and why he called you a sucker .
he called me a what ?
mike ross , allow me to introduce the bainbridge briefs .
which stack ?
all of them .
wait a minute , are these all--
still printing , yeah . i &apos;d give it about a half hour .
that &apos;s six printers , 23 pages a minute , 30 minutes .
that &apos;s 4,140 pages .
plus all this .
which means the next time you negotiate a deal ,
i would suggest to get your facts straight .
i am a sucker .
when did that happen ?
nice of you to join us this morning .
for your information , mr. sunshine ,
i &apos;ve been here all night proofing .
that belongs to-- okay .
where &apos;s my confirmation ?
what ?
the fact that you don &apos;t know already concerns me .
oh , you mean the patent thing ?
&quot; the patent thing &quot; is the only piece of paper
that &apos;s holding up our deal from yesterday .
where is it ?
it &apos;s on my desk .
well , if it &apos;s not on mine by the time i get back ,
i &apos;m gonna feed you to louis .
no problem .
please tell me that you filed that--
patent ? no , not yet .
i gave it to you yesterday .
at the same time i gave you my bainbridge briefs ,
which you haven &apos;t finished .
i was here all night , and i barely got through half .
and i was on hold for almost 11 minutes
before i gave up on your patent ,
so what &apos;s your point ?
i swear i will finish those filings ,
but you have to give me this patent confirmation
before harvey gets back .
sorry , golden boy . deal &apos;s a deal .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
uh ... i &apos;m proofing briefs . why ?
is there a problem ?
yeah , there is .
that &apos;s gregory &apos;s responsibility , why are you handling it ?
oh , i ... volunteered .
he didn &apos;t pawn it off on you ?
no . no .
i mean , he didn &apos;t even want me to do it ,
but you know , i @-@ i @-@ i had some extra time .
so i insisted .
congratulations .
you &apos;ve shown loyalty to your fellow associates .
i know gregory tricked you into doing his work .
i wanted to see how you react when pressed about it .
you held up .
i respect that .
thanks ?
see , but i don &apos;t understand something now .
if you didn &apos;t know how to file a patent ,
then why didn &apos;t you just run to harvey ?
he was busy .
but you see , mike ,
that &apos;s why you come to see me .
look , mike , i know ... i can come across a bit ...
prickly .
but we &apos;re a team here .
that means i &apos;m here to help .
okay , all right .
so can you help me now ?
i already have .
are--
thank you , louis .
donna , blue is your color .
is harvey back ?
no .
can i put this on his desk ?
yes .
will you tell him i put it there hours ago ?
what time you want me to say ?
11 a.m. ?
absolutely .
and then maybe i can use my access to his bank accounts
to buy myself a house in the hamptons .
2 : 15 ?
no .
you wanted to see me ?
sit down .
i looked through your work on the bainbridge briefs .
spectacular .
you caught the discrepancies between listed assets and potential assets .
that had a huge impact , mike .
yeah , i know . millions .
but anyone would &apos;ve caught that , right ?
um , out of the 50 associates that are under purview ,
not one of them would &apos;ve caught that .
you just have this eye for detail , mike .
i mean , no wonder harvey &apos;s so crazy about you .
it &apos;s amazing . i mean , i really ,
really , seriously appreciate that .
hey , thank you , louis .
that &apos;s nice .
you know that i pick a ...
pony out of the herd every year , don &apos;t you ?
a pony ?
oh , yeah .
someone who shows potential .
stamp my own little brand on him .
are you that pony , mike ?
i ... work for harvey .
as you should .
good .
well , listen , i have some work to get to .
so maybe we can meet for lunch tomorrow at the club .
1 p.m. ?
uh , you know , tomorrow ...
i know i just posed that as a question ,
but i really didn &apos;t mean it that way .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
we just heard from wyatt .
he got a response from the patent office .
and ?
it &apos;s been denied .
what ?
evidently , there was a similar claim .
wait , what do you mean ?
somebody beat us to it ?
no , someone beat you to it .
they filed less than 24 hours ago ,
which means you filed a day later than you said you would .
i tried to tell you that i didn &apos;t know how to do that .
and i told you to figure it out .
and i did , and it got filed .
after you lied and said you &apos;d already followed through .
okay , what &apos;s gonna happen now ?
i suggest you get on the phone ,
call the patent office , and find out who beat us to it .
then you &apos;re gonna have donna find any judge who will listen ,
so we can get an injunction ,
and stop whoever it is from launching their product first .
okay , got it .
now i &apos;ve gotta call wyatt and calm him down .
you think that &apos;s gonna be a walk in the park ?
hey , harvey ...
did you tell him it was me ?
why would i do that ? i &apos;m responsible for you .
it was me .
they signed the paperwork , wyatt .
they can &apos;t pull out .
the patent dispute is not an issue , okay ?
no , they cut the check . end of story .
i &apos;m in court right now , let me call you back .
so it &apos;s velocity data solutions .
did you serve them with notice of the hearing ?
they are a billion dollar company .
the bigger they are , the harder they fall .
did you not see the sign outside ?
i &apos;m just putting it away , your honor .
it should already be in your pocket .
but you were already running late , so perhaps that &apos;s why it wasn &apos;t .
let the records show that the counsel is fined $ 1,000
for failing to follow the posted rules of the court .
your honor , i didn &apos;t mean--
and for mouthing off .
mouthing off ?
another outburst like that , and you will be escorted out .
mr. salinger ?
your honor , this is a waste of your time .
the u.s. patent office is the only judicial body
that should be handling this dispute .
velocity data solutions requests dismissal .
your honor . if i may ?
this injunction request--
counsel approach .
that &apos;s the exhibit filing ?
why wasn &apos;t i given a courtesy copy ?
given the expedited nature of this hearing , i--
hand it to me . hand it to me .
and i would &apos;ve assumed that a lawyer appearing before a judge would come on time ,
with his mouth shut , and prepared with a courtesy brief .
my apologies .
request denied .
court adjourned for morning .
better luck next time , harvey .
from now on , i want him when i go against you .
wait here .
your honor , i have--
send him in .
counselor ?
you asked to see me .
you must have something to say .
excluding friends , associates ,
and the clients that i represent ,
there are very few people that i &apos;m on a first name basis with .
and i &apos;ve never had anyone ,
let alone a judge i &apos;ve never met ,
address me as harvey in open court .
but if you &apos;re gonna screw me ,
i guess it &apos;s only fair that you call me by name .
i could have you brought up on review
for talking to me like that .
then we can get it all on record .
get what ?
whatever it is that you seem to have against me for no apparent reason .
i have a solid argument
for any reasonable judge to grant my injunction .
so solid it begs the question ,
why do you have it in for me ?
and i don &apos;t even know your first name .
really ?
my wife never mentioned it ?
your wife ?
the woman you had an affair with last month ?
wait , what happened in there ?
donna , the address for that fundraiser at the gallery last month ,
i need you to text it to me , and clear my afternoon .
hey , where are we going ?
you &apos;re going back to the office to file
an interference claim with the patent office .
okay . wait , what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s how they determine who wins these situations .
it &apos;s not always who filed first ,
so we have a chance .
so why didn &apos;t we do that in the first place ?
because it takes longer ,
and i wanted to head velocity off at the pass .
hey , where you going ?
to iron out a wrinkle .
if you &apos;re really interested , come back tomorrow around 1 : 00 .
the afternoon light really makes this canvas come alive .
pardon me .
i was wondering , would i get a discount for being the guy
you cheated on your husband with ?
can you excuse me for a second ?
what are you doing here ?
i had a hearing in front of the judge this morning ,
it didn &apos;t go very well .
why did you lie to him ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i mean , i recall you being tipsy that night ,
but i &apos;m finding it hard to believe that your memory is so cloudy ,
you forgot i sent you home in a cab .
after humiliating me .
i was the perfect gentleman .
yes , exactly .
i fall all over myself making a pass ,
and you do the right thing and send me home .
i &apos;m sorry you felt humiliated ,
but i told you , i don &apos;t sleep with married women .
right . the moral code .
no . it &apos;s too big of a pain in the ass
as evidenced by my experience in court this morning .
what do you want from me , harvey .
i need you to tell him the truth .
i can &apos;t .
yes , you can .
why didn &apos;t you just tell him ?
he &apos;s never gonna believe me .
and what makes you think he &apos;ll believe me ?
because he &apos;d want to .
our whole marriage ,
donald &apos;s only cared about one thing .
his sterling reputation .
never overturned .
i was ... when he found out you and i had ...
he changed .
he looked at me for the first time again .
like i mattered .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t tell him .
no , this is a request from the applicant for--
yes , but i have up to a year before you--
hello-- no , i can &apos;t hold ...
you ready ?
i can &apos;t go to the club ,
i have to do this for harvey .
yes , the person before you said
that i had to file the blue form--
no , no , no , no . we have a court reserved
in 30 minutes , we have to go now .
yes , i &apos;m trying to file the oral hearing .
but what you people keep doing is trans-- hello ?
hello ?
you work for me , too .
and that means when harvey is not here ,
you gotta listen to what i say , mike .
louis , this claim needs to be filed today .
harvey &apos;s orders .
in that case ... gregory !
i &apos;m on your side , remember ?
watch this .
yes ?
hi . patent interference claim ...
can you have it filed before we get back ?
cool ? thanks . let &apos;s go .
what &apos;s with the ... ?
who &apos;s winning ?
you need to warm up ?
no , i &apos;m good .
you serve first .
come on , show me what you got .
15 @-@ love .
all right , you wanna play like that ?
let &apos;s do this thing . come on .
wait , wait .
hey , tom .
game .
i mean , i have seen your approach shot , man .
you have really improved . i &apos;m not kidding .
you know , maybe you can play now ,
me and my associate were just starting up .
how about you two against me ,
i &apos;ll just play--
tom , seriously , i &apos;ll even--
i &apos;ll spot you three sets .
all right , i &apos;ll see you later then .
isn &apos;t that , uh ... ?
it &apos;s tom keller .
yeah , the premiere fantasy sports guy , right ?
that &apos;s him .
yeah , i play it ever a year .
yeah , you and five million
other fantasy footballers .
i mean , the guy generates 200 million per annum , right ?
and he still uses his fraternity brother as a general counsel .
i mean , someone with that many assets just makes me sick .
okay .
so is it my serve ?
let &apos;s hit the showers .
but , wait ...
sorry , sir , but--
no introductions necessary ,
we &apos;re on a first name basis .
i brought you a present .
yours to keep , after you sign my injunction .
a pen .
it &apos;s custom .
french . le bic .
oh , my earlier ruling wasn &apos;t clear enough for you ?
crystal , but i didn &apos;t want you to suffer for it .
you see , if you don &apos;t sign my injunction ,
there &apos;s gonna be a lawsuit .
and when the next judge sees all the facts ,
he &apos;s gonna overturn your ruling .
you may be right .
but by then your clients will have dumped you .
you may be right ,
but that sterling reputation that you value so highly ...
down the tubes .
which would matter , except for one thing .
i &apos;ve decided to leave the bench .
try my hand at litigation .
and i &apos;m your last case .
divorce will do that . make you wanna change your life .
you filed for divorce ?
soon enough .
perhaps we could discuss
a little quid pro quo before i do .
i &apos;m listening .
you sign a document that says you slept with my wife .
i &apos;ll give you your injunction .
and why would you want me to do that ?
to prevent her from taking me for half of everything i own .
so what you &apos;re saying is you &apos;d like to blackmail me .
i &apos;m saying we could both benefit .
and since you &apos;re the one who screwed me ,
i &apos;d say you owe me one .
harvey specter .
what are you hiding from me , harvey ?
wyatt , do you remember six months ago when you got all nervous
and you thought everything was falling apart ?
yeah , yeah . but this is a little different .
that &apos;s what you said then .
and a year ago , and 18 months ago .
and we agreed that when this happens again ,
i &apos;ll remind you of those times
and i &apos;ll hang up .
okay , harvey--
trust me , it &apos;s for your own good .
harvey , please don &apos;t hang up--
hey , tom . you just missed a great game .
we were , uh ... we were just re--
i was beating him .
you know , ten years ago ,
before these dot @-@ com millionaires ,
there were men of substance in this club .
you know , men who understood how business gets done .
well , maybe he &apos;s just not interested in
talking business while he &apos;s in a towel .
like , he &apos;s not interested because he doesn &apos;t think i &apos;m cool .
and he &apos;s a pothead
who thinks that anybody who doesn &apos;t smoke is a nerd .
i mean ...
so i treat my body like a temple .
does that make me uncool ? i don &apos;t think so .
no .
but on the other hand ...
you kinda seem his type .
why do you say that ?
because you &apos;re young .
and you think of yourself as ... hip .
whatever , i guess .
you know , i &apos;m sure you enjoyed the occasional bong hit .
no . no , i don &apos;t smoke .
i mean , that &apos;s just a little strange .
why is it strange ?
i mean , because the drug test that you took--
well , that i made you take--
would indicate otherwise .
you &apos;re not gonna dispute it now , are you ?
relax , mike .
relax .
i &apos;m not offended .
i &apos;m not even surprised .
and in fact , in this instance ,
we can use this to our advantage .
what are you talking about , louis ?
i &apos;m just saying , you know , back in the day ,
to woo a client you would take him to dinner ,
you would buy him a drink .
but that &apos;s not gonna work with tom .
not in a million years . not with me , anyway .
but with someone of his generation
who shares the same proclivities ?
you saying you want me to smoke pot with him ?
i &apos;m saying you can help me land him as a client .
that &apos;s the only reason i &apos;m here , isn &apos;t it ?
no , mike . stop .
just stop , okay ?
i assure you , no one was more disappointed than me
when i found out the results of your drug test , okay ?
then i had to say to myself ,
&quot; louis , do what you do , make lemonade . &quot;
and if i don &apos;t ?
you &apos;re a smart kid .
and i really wanna see you succeed .
ball &apos;s in your court .
hey , tom , i was just gonna tell you , i wanted to--
okay .
dude creeps me out , man .
and he never wears a towel , ever .
yeah , tell me about it .
hey , i know you must hear this all the time ,
but totally addicted to your website , man .
all right , who placed sixth in passing yards last year ?
carson palmer .
3,970 .
how many sacks did james hall have ?
11 ?
ten and a half .
yeah , i know , i rounded up .
well , your league doesn &apos;t or i would &apos;ve come in better than 20th .
you &apos;r ross &apos;s raiders , right ?
yeah , mike ross .
tom keller .
good to meet you .
congratulations , man , you got a nice little team there .
yeah .
no , if roethlisberger hadn &apos;t let you down ,
you &apos;d have been top ten for sure , i &apos;m telling you .
yeah , well , that &apos;s what happens
when you get high before the draft , right ?
you get high ?
how &apos;s it going with harvey ?
me ?
uh ... it &apos;s ... you know , it &apos;s good .
i &apos;m learning .
a lot of learning . bye .
what &apos;s black and white and gonna cost you dearly ?
took me all morning to file this , golden boy .
you owe me and i won &apos;t forget it .
oh , god ! thank you .
you smell papery .
wyatt , it doesn &apos;t happen immediately .
the paperwork &apos;s coming .
don &apos;t worry about it , okay ?
there you go , look at that .
wyatt , let me call you back , okay ?
five minutes . bye .
what &apos;s this ?
what is this ?
that &apos;s confirmation of the interference claim
which i proofed . up top .
what , you think you &apos;re working in a fraternity ?
you don &apos;t barge in here when i &apos;m on the phone .
and why you so flushed ?
why am i so what ?
your face is red .
it looks like you &apos;ve been in the sun .
yeah , i--
i-- this morning , louis took me to the tennis club .
he didn &apos;t give you the speech about the , um ,
the ponies , did he ?
oh , my god .
how he likes to cut one from the herd .
the ponies .
was he wearing the headband ?
you know about the headband ? with the ...
oh , my god , are you kidding me with that guy ?
hey , if you guys were playing tennis all morning ,
how &apos;d you have time to file this ?
he-- it was this morning--
actually , i was on the phone with them ,
and louis helped me--
look at me .
and he did this snapping thing , and gregory--
look at me .
you &apos;re high .
get out .
harvey , you don &apos;t understand . louis--
out .
donna ?
get wyatt back on the line ?
what are you doing in here ?
it &apos;s the ladies room .
i &apos;m sorry .
look , can you do me a favor ? can we--
can we just keep this our little secret ?
why are your eyes so red ?
i need some air .
you took mike ross on a field trip today ?
yep .
aside from subjecting him
to you in a towel , what happened ?
well , i beat him in straight sets , if that &apos;s what you &apos;re get ...
don &apos;t play dumb , louis . tell me what you did to him .
what , are you jealous ?
harvey , come on , the kid is starving for a mentor ,
someone to give him some advice .
so maybe if you just took the time--
i &apos;m telling you right now , you try to move in on him--
harvey , where is this coming from ?
harvey , i &apos;ve got the outside counsel for velocity on the line .
put them through .
what happened after you smoked with that guy ?
i just got paranoid .
i felt bad for lying to him ,
i told him that louis put me up to it
and that he couldn &apos;t trust him .
so what did he say ?
he said that louis gave him the creeps anyway .
you know , he &apos;s never gonna hire him .
okay , you have to tell harvey .
i tried , he wasn &apos;t listening .
so then go home and tell him tomorrow .
oh , god , you should &apos;ve seen his face .
we had a deal .
what deal ?
thanks for hearing me out .
no , what &apos;re you talking about ?
what deal ?
it &apos;s nothing .
i just promised that i wouldn &apos;t ...
do anything stupid and let him down , and i did .
wait , you let him down ?
no , the way i see it , he let you down .
what ?
he &apos;s gotta know what louis is capable of ,
so if he didn &apos;t listen to what happened
it &apos;s &apos; cause he didn &apos;t want to .
mike , you need to tell him .
i don &apos;t know how often you come across harvey ,
but he &apos;s not exactly the listening type .
right .
but he &apos;s also the first person that would tell you
never to take no for an answer from anyone .
harvey , how you doing this fine day ?
i &apos;m ready to hear your settlement offer , george .
cutting to the chase , i like that .
what &apos;s the number ?
ten million .
that &apos;s half what we spent developing the prototype .
and ten million more than you &apos;ll get ,
the way the wind &apos;s blowing .
yeah , well , winds can change .
and you and i both know the injunction
will get overturned on appeal .
i don &apos;t know anything of the kind .
then why are you calling with an offer at all ?
15 , that &apos;s as high as i &apos;ll go .
okay , i &apos;m hanging up now .
20 million , that &apos;s it .
the offer &apos;s good for 24 hours .
and i &apos;m sure i don &apos;t have to remind you
that you &apos;re legally required to present this to your client .
is he free ?
not for you .
how much did he tell you ?
he didn &apos;t have to tell me , i read it on his face .
you heard him .
maybe he did the same to me .
get in there .
and be careful .
harvey .
we talked about this , right ? barging into my office .
i &apos;m not leaving until you hear me out .
wanna bet ?
you owe it to me .
oh , i owe it to you ?
yeah .
look , this is not my fault , all right ?
louis made me do it .
louis did , right .
he put a gun to your head and made you smoke pot .
yeah , he did . he pulled out the drug test--
which i failed , by the way .
and then he told me that if i didn &apos;t smoke pot
to help him land this new client , that he &apos;d fire me .
come on .
it &apos;s not so different than asking someone
out for drinks , is it ?
you and i had a deal .
i &apos;m sorry .
and if next time louis asks you to do something
that i told you not to do , what then ?
i told you that i did not have a choice .
oh , because he had a gun to your head .
yes !
what are your choices if someone puts a gun to your head ?
what are you talking about ? you do what they say
or they shoot you .
wrong .
you take the gun , or you pull out a bigger one ,
or you call their bluff .
or you do any one of 146 other things .
if you can &apos;t think for yourself ,
maybe you aren &apos;t cut out for this .
no , i can and i am . look , i did what i had to do .
i made the best out of a bad situation .
which is what i am good at .
which is what you hired me to do in the first place .
yeah , i hired you and i expect your loyalty .
so if louis asks you to do something like that ,
you come to me first .
oh , right .
like when i came to you and you told me
that i couldn &apos;t sit at the adult table , right .
i remember that . or @-@ or when you told me
to go file the patent by myself , like that ?
excuse me ?
you know what ?
maybe it &apos;s time you showed me some loyalty .
do you know how long it was
before i got to sit at the adult table ?
it was when i brought in my first client .
which i don &apos;t recall you having done .
and when you screwed up that patent
and wyatt went ape shit on me ,
i didn &apos;t put that on you , i took it on myself .
because that &apos;s my job .
and it &apos;s your job to do what i say when i say it .
so if you &apos;re talking about loyalty ,
you better goddamn earn it .
you &apos;re right .
i said i &apos;m sorry and i meant it .
harvey ...
i want you to tr-- i need you to trust me , okay ?
and i will work as long as i can ,
as hard as it takes to make that happen .
i mean , you don &apos;t even have to pay me , all right ?
i &apos;ll work for free .
for free .
what , i meant ... not forever .
just as , like , a probationary thing .
donna , tell wyatt i &apos;m on my way over .
do you never have to press a button ?
got it . and jessica wants to see
mike in her office right now .
louis told me what you did at the club .
i bet he didn &apos;t tell you the whole story .
he told me enough to impress me .
your new business is hard .
people will promise you the world
but until they sign that engagement letter ,
it means nothing .
now i don &apos;t know what you told tom keller ,
but bring a client in at your age ...
that reminds me of harvey .
jessica , before we get started ,
there &apos;s something in the retainer that tom pointed out .
it &apos;s not a big deal , really .
we were just--
no , no , no , no , no , no .
like i said , we &apos;re here to make you happy .
right ?
i thought you wanted nothing to do with him ?
i didn &apos;t . but then i thought about it .
and he might not be a very good person ,
but a little deviousness
is the sort of thing you look for in a good lawyer .
i mean , the other guy i was with , he was too nice .
we were buddies , we went to school together .
it &apos;s time i grew up , got a real shark .
well , i had no intention of being that way to get your business .
that &apos;s exactly why i insisted that you be my point man .
i want someone being devious for me ,
not to me .
what ?
it &apos;s just ...
louis would &apos;ve never told jessica that i existed ,
let alone that i helped him if you hadn &apos;t done that .
hey , the way i see it , the three of us stick together ,
we &apos;ll make a pretty good team .
you know , i got a better idea .
$ 20 million ?
they claim it &apos;s their final offer .
that &apos;s what it cost to make the prototype .
not to mention my entire savings and two years of my life .
wyatt ...
they know we &apos;re stalled on our injunction .
which means , to them , they &apos;re giving you a fair price
as an insurance policy against the risk of
possibly losing the interference claim .
i don &apos;t care what it is to them .
it &apos;s not fair .
fair or not , it &apos;s their final offer .
you think i should take it ?
i think you should tell them to shove it up their ass .
ladies and gentlemen , i &apos;m terribly sorry ,
but we have a problem .
what problem ?
we came down here
because you led us to believe that
your client was ready to accept - our settlement agreement .
and i thought he would .
look , i took him the offer .
i presented it to him , and recommended that he take it .
in fact , i urged him to take it .
you know what he told me to do ?
he told me to tell you to shove it up your ass .
now i know you didn &apos;t have me come all the way
down here just to tell me that .
you &apos;re right . that &apos;s not all wyatt said .
he said rather than spending years fighting this out in court ,
in 48 hours he &apos;s gonna put this online .
that &apos;s a little rough , but you get the idea .
what are you showing us ? is this a website ?
available at the suntech domain name .
all the design plans and calculations have been uploaded .
is this online now ?
can be .
which means the whole world will have access to my designs .
they &apos;ll be ten knock @-@ offs of that phone
before you can catch a cab back to your headquarters .
we could file an injunction .
not before tomorrow .
and once that technology is out there ,
good luck putting that genie back in the bottle .
well , then we &apos;ll sue .
but my client won &apos;t have any money .
what he will have is credit for the initial design .
which , after he incorporates under a different name ,
will be worth a hell of a lot more money
than the $ 20 million that you &apos;re offering .
and you &apos;re saying that this was all your client &apos;s idea .
yes .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .
thought you weren &apos;t coming .
i had to settle a case first .
you have the paperwork we talked about ?
what is this ?
it &apos;s a copy of the judicial conduct codes .
a friend of mine works at the attorney general &apos;s office
gave it to me . we had a nice chat about you .
i told him if you were willing to blackmail someone once ,
chances are you &apos;d done it before .
he &apos;s very anxious to meet you .
you think you can get away with screwing my wife
and then have me investigated ?
you actually have it the wrong way around .
the only thing i &apos;ve done so far
is have you investigated .
what ?
i never actually slept with lauren .
but i knew you &apos;d never believe me
so i kept my mouth shut .
but now that she &apos;s getting a divorce ,
my policy no longer applies .
and of course , she &apos;s free to date whoever she pleases .
and she pleases me .
enjoy your evening , donald .
i &apos;ve always heard about this place .
which room is hoffa buried in ?
not sure , but ...
the arc of the covenant &apos;s just down the hall on the left .
when you &apos;re finished down here ,
i &apos;d like you to come upstairs
and start putting together a settlement memorandum .
they went for it ?
thanks to your idea .
well , i mean , it wasn &apos;t really my idea--
they &apos;re settling for 400 million .
okay , yeah , that was my idea .
so does this mean i get to keep my job ?
i wanna talk to you about that .
before you do , harvey--
do we have to have a conversation
about how you keep interrupting me ?
look , sometimes when someone pulls a gun on you ,
instead of bullets it &apos;s filled with blanks .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a copy of your drug test results .
but this says i passed .
you did .
louis showed me a fake ?
i &apos;m gonna go have a talk with him .
you know what , why don &apos;t you let me do it ?
you think you &apos;re ready for the adult table ?
what , didn &apos;t you hear ? i just landed my first client .
why do you think i &apos;m showing you this now
and not going straight to louis ?
go easy on him .
nope .
good boy .
you lied .
that other drug test you showed me was a fake .
how &apos;d you figure that out ?
someone once told me i have an eye for detail
when it comes to important paperwork .
well , maybe you &apos;re not as good as you think you are ,
or you would &apos;ve caught it sooner .
okay , so this was all some sort of test ?
you blackmail me , you jeopardize my job ?
mike , stop . stop .
we all came out ahead , didn &apos;t we ?
that new client &apos;s gonna bring us millions .
jessica knows your name now .
it &apos;s a win @-@ win .
you &apos;re right .
she does know my name .
which is why she &apos;ll listen when i tell her
exactly what happened .
okay , but before you do that
it is ... that time again , isn &apos;t it ?
what time ?
pee in a cup time .
and now you know i &apos;d fail .
of course , you can run to mommy ,
tell her your story , and take your chances .
or you can take the test and trust
that i &apos;ll keep it to myself as my way of thanking you .
ah , you know , i actually did some reading
of the pearson @-@ harmon drug policy as well .
it turns out that you have to wait three months
before you can request another drug test .
see , it &apos;s a little detail that you might &apos;ve missed .
so , drink up .
oh , and i spoke to tom keller .
he says that he feels he &apos;d be best served
with a combination of me and harvey .
