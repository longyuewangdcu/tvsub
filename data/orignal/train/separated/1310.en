Where am I?
Where are you?
You're at the park?
I don't see you.
Oh, crap.
Hi, mom.
Yeah. I got Joey.
We're on our way home.
Yes, we'll do our homework.
Okay. See you soon.
Love you, too.
Bye.
Hi. Are you Mandy Mateo?
Yeah.
Hi. I'm Miss Baker, Joey's substitute teacher.
He's hurt himself on the playground.
Oh, no.
Oh, he's okay, uh,
but he fell pretty hard off the jungle gym.
Get in. I'll take you to him.
Thanks.
You got it?
Yeah.
Let's go.
Wait. W-where are you going?
The school's that way.
Joey?
Mandy!
Joey!
Joey!
Mandy!
The cleaning lady put this in the dryer.
It's vicuna wool.
Who puts vicuna wool in a dryer?
It's tight. Does it make me look fat?
Yes. You look ginormous.
I can't believe how fat you are.
What -- what do you weigh? Like 115 pounds?
116.8.
Wow, no wonder.
Really?
Because I've been craving carbohydrates lately.
Maybe it's a hormonal imbalance.
Maybe you don't have enough to do.
It's a little slow.
Let's go to the gym.
Yoga.
Boxing.
Zumba.
Beer.
Jane
Nicole?
Excuse me, ma'am.
That's Dan's wife.
Your old partner in DCU?
What? What happened?
Jane, Mandy's been taken.
What?
Joey -- Joey saw it.
T-they took her in -- in a car, near her school.
And I-I need Dan. I need you to help me.
Okay. Okay. Get Frost and Korsak now.
Did you call 911?
Yes, yes, and, uh, detective Womack from area "E"
said that they couldn't put out an Amber alert.
Okay. Why not?
Well, because Joey just saw a-a blue car,
And I guess it's not enough information. Look, I need Dan!
Okay, we'll get Dan. Okay?
Vince, Vince!
Get Dan Mateo. He's undercover in DCU.
Drug control unit. On it.
Yes.
Um, can I talk to Joey just --just for a sec?
Nicole, let's go upstairs and get a full description
of what Amanda was wearing, list of her friends.
Look, I-I can't leave him. He saw it happen.
It's fine, mom. I want to help.
Nicole, he'll be safe, all right?
I'll have him back upstairs in just a minute.
We got a really great cafe.
You want to go get a cookie or something?
I don't want anything.
Please just find my sister.
Okay.
We're gonna find her. Okay?
Come on. Let's go.
You get real close when you work undercover, you know?
My life depended on Dan,
And now his daughter's life depends on me.
I know this is difficult to talk about,
But I want to go through it one more time, okay?
Okay.
Did you see the license plate? Any letters or numbers?
No. No. Just that it was blue.
Um, I bet you were looking at your sister, weren't you?
Yeah. She was really scared.
I've never seen her look like that before.
I bet you were scared, too.
So scared.
You know I used to work with your dad?
I was his partner. Did he tell you that?
No.
Well, I bet he's taught you a lot
about being a detective, huh?
He says I'm good at it,
but I should have looked at the license plate.
Hey, it's okay.
Can you tell me about the lady again?
She was driving. I could see her.
What did she look like? Was she caucasian?
Was she african-american?
She was white. She had brown hair.
I think she was about as old as my mom.
Okay. That's great. Can you tell me about the man?
I don't know. He was big.
Okay. Okay.
It's okay.
Hey, you mentioned that the car was blue.
Was it a station wagon? Was it a mini van?
No, no, it was just a regular car.
It was old.
You keep thinking like a detective, all right?
I don't know how much I have that.
Yes, you have. Hey.
Yes, you have, okay?
We'll be right back, okay?
Ok.
You think we can get anything else out of him?
He's been traumatized.
I think if we give him some drawing materials --
You know, it's a natural form of communication
for children his age.
Maybe he can draw something that he can't verbalize.
Ma, you got any crayons?
Yeah.
We need some paper, too.
Uh, how about the paper place mats?
It's perfect. Thank you.
Hey. I found Dan. He's on his way.
Great. Okay.
Um, I'm gonna be back in just a little while, okay?
Okay.
Just a little bit.
Bye.
She told Korsak they're separated.
Dan and Nicole separated?
When?
God, this job just kills every relationship.
Nicole! Nicole.
Dan!
Nicole. Why? Why were they alone?
Look, I leave them for 45 minutes
after school so that I can finish work.
She's 13. Nicole, we live in a city!
Well, where were you?! You left me with two kids
and a mortgage while you live in your apartment!
Because you kicked me out!
Hey! Ho! Come on. Stop it. Stop it.
Blaming Nicole isn't gonna get your daughter back.
Where is she? What do you know?
We got a description on the car,
And it's a man and a woman.
A jack and jill? Jane, we're not gonna get her back!
Stop it. Yes, we will. All right?
Dan! We will find her.
Three hours!
Three hours is the average for abducted kids!
We don't find her in three hours, she's dead.
All right. You let me do my job. All right?
You concentrate on taking care of Joey and Nicole.
Where's Joey?
He's downstairs in the cafe
With my mother and Dr. Isles.
I'm gonna go hold him.
We can't get a hit on the girl's cellphone GPS.
Whoever grabbed her knew enough to remove the battery.
Amber alert with Mandy's picture is out now.
It's all over New England.
Okay, good.
How fast can we get her computer and cellphone records?
Fast. It's a cop's kid.
Last time I saw Mandy,
She...she was just a little girl, 5 maybe.
Where's Nicole?
Korsak sent her home
to get more photos of Mandy and Mandy's computer.
I'm working on getting into her social-network sites.
Okay.
Hey, what are you doing?
Eliminating Dan as a suspect.
You think Dan snatched his own kid?
Parents are in the middle of a custody battle.
I think we need to make sure
Dan didn't have anything to do with Mandy's disappearance.
Korsak, we worked undercover with Dan for two years.
How could you possibly think
he had anything to do with this?
I want to find Mandy as badly as you do.
But we got to think like cops,
not like his friends.
We got to rule him out, Jane.
Until we do, he's a suspect.
But Joey said there was a woman driving the car
And a man in the backseat. We're looking for a couple.
I got to make sure it isn't Dan in the backseat.
Well, by the time you rule him out, Mandy could be dead.
Area "E" Units are on their way to Stony Brook.
They just found the body of a young girl.
Oh, god.
When did you guys find her?
Uh, 15 minutes ago.
Potheads looking for a little nature stumbled on her.
We got here fast
because of Amanda Mateo.
Perfect spot. She could have been laying here for months.
Yeah, she was hidden pretty well
In the trench, covered in leaves.
We got lucky, if you can call it that.
First responders moved her?
Yeah. We were all pulling for Dan.
Hate to see it end like this.
Man, I was at Mandy's christening.
So was I.
Is that Mandy?!
Hey, Dan.
Is that her? Is that mandy?
Dan. Dan. You can't be here, Dan.
Dan. You can't be here, Danny!
Get off me, Vince!
Dan!
Jane.
Let go of me!
Is it Mandy?
I don't know. I can't tell.
Vince!
Let him look.
Is -- is that my daughter?
I don't know.
It's not her.
Who is she?
How'd she die?
She was asphyxiated from the application of a slow,
constant pressure to her trachea.
She looks a little like Mandy. About the same age.
How long she been dead?
Not long.
She's still warm to the touch.
Less than two hours.
So she was murdered
right after Mandy was kidnapped.
Same age, similar build, hair color.
One girl kidnapped,
another one turns up dead an hour later.
I don't believe in coincidence like that. Do you?
No.
You think Mandy was a replacement for this girl?
Yeah.
Is that a shoeprint on her neck?
It's a heavy-treaded impression
consistent with that of a work boot.
Size 12.
Joey said the man in the car was big.
Is it possible that he crushed her trachea with his foot?
It's possible.
What the hell?
Maybe she's bound like that so her kidnapper
could keep her looking like a young girl.
Okay, we need to find out who this girl is. Now.
There's a lot of missing kids, Jane.
35,000 in New England alone.
It'll take weeks to track her by her dental records.
Well, then, we take a picture of her face,
and we show it to Mandy's friends and family
and see if anybody recognizes her.
What are you doing?
I'm checking her iliac-crest epiphysis.
She's older than she appears.
It's in its beginning stages of fusing.
She's about 17.
There's some type of staining going on with her sweatshirt.
The edges are white.
I'm gonna take a guess, Jane.
I-I think this is a mixture of tears and mucus.
Look where it is.
Yeah, it's in a weird spot.
I don't think this is from our victim.
I think it's from someone else.
What, like she was holding someone against her.
Dan's clear. Just saw the video.
His squad had him under surveillance.
He's doing drug buys the whole time.
Thank god. I'm sorry, Jane.
No, it's -- you were right, Korsak.
This is tough.
Please, Maura. We got to find
an I.D. on this girl.
Okay? She could be the key.
You have to help us find Mandy.
I really love the way you put the clouds
behind the lighthouse.
Can I get you some more coffee?
No, thank you.
Honey, Joey, look, I want you to eat something, okay?
I'm not hungry.
Oh, that's too bad.
I have a big bowl of cauliflower
with your name on it.
Yeah, he loves cauliflower. Right?
No, I don't.
I could put some hot sauce
and some asparagus on the side.
Yum-yum!
Do you have any hot dogs?
I sure do.
Can I have fries?
Yeah.
Hey, Joey.
Hey.
I, uh, brought Mandy's computer.
Okay, great. Uh, detective Frost will go through it.
Dan and I -- um, we argued
about whether or not she should have her own computer.
But, I mean, she needs it for school, so...
I'm sorry, Nicole.
Oh, wow. She's so grown-up.
She's beautiful, Nicole.
Did I tell you that she, um...
she plays soccer for school? She's really good.
No, I didn't know that.
She looks strong.
Uh, I have a picture that I need you to look at.
Okay, yeah. The girl you found?
Yeah.
No, don't recognize her.
Okay.
Honey, uh...
Detective Rizzoli is gonna show you a photo, okay?
I need to know if you recognize this girl, okay?
Is she dead?
Yes.
Joey, do you know her?
No.
Okay.
Would you like some chocolate milk?
I just want Mandy.
I know you do, sweetie. We all do.
It's been over three hours since Mandy was abducted.
It's an average, Jane.
God, she looks so young.
And she's so thin.
What happened to you?
Well, she has a vitamin-D deficiency,
uh, atrophied muscles,
stunted growth, pale skin,
exhibits signs of malnutrition.
Was she held in captivity?
That's my opinion.
Any signs of sexual assault?
Yes.
She has elevated estrogen and progesterone levels.
She was on birth-control pills.
You know, when I first heard that it was a couple,
my mind immediately went
to Jaycee Dugard and Elizabeth Smart.
How long was she held?
Given my findings...
I'd say this girl was in captivity
from three to five years.
I've arrested hundreds of male sexual offenders.
I'm not saying I understand that,
but what I can't ever get my head around
is how a woman could help do this to someone.
Well, you have to look at the women as victims, too.
They're typically very damaged people,
ripe for abuse.
And the abused becomes the abuser.
Exactly.
And they help him...
create this bizarre version of a nuclear family
with him in the center.
It's Frost.
He's got Mandy's phone records.
All right. Go. I'll be here.
Jane, I'm doing -- I'm doing everything I can here.
I know you are.
Help me find Mandy.
What am I not seeing that I need to see?
Sweet girl.
I'm so sorry this happened to you.
She had a facebook account, myspace, and twitter.
Wow. This generation puts their whole lives online.
Yeah, pretty much.
She had it set so that
only her friends could see most of it,
but there were still some public areas.
So anybody could get a look at her.
Afraid so.
Got her phone records.
What are those?
Are those social-network sites?
I didn't agree to that.
Dan, you can't be in here if you're gonna interfere.
I'm sorry. What do you have?
Mandy's phone records.
Look, she gets out of school at 3:15, okay?
She's supposed to pick Joey up and take him home.
He said that she told him to wait at the playground. Why?
Well, here's her last call.
3:29 p.m. It's from her mother.
Well, she texts nonstop. Where are the texts?
Your wife said she,
uh, got Mandy a new smartphone.
Keep going, Frost.
Well, it's actually good for us.
I got a whole series of I.M.S.
What's the difference?
Well, texts go through the phone system.
We can get the phone numbers but not the content.
Instant messages go across wireless internet.
So Mandy was instant-messaging.
Can you see what she was saying?
Yes, and we can track the messages
back to phones and computers.
Here's every screen name
she instant-messaged in the last week.
We got a whole series of I.M.S
between Mandy and "Suprgurrl97."
Who's "Suprgurrl"?
Chloe Cameron.
That's her best friend.
"Madmandy97: where are you?"
"Suprgurrl97: see you at park entrance. Come on."
See you at the park entrance?
Why's she going to the park entrance?
That's the last message there.
But maybe that's why she left Joey.
Only Chloe can tell us now.
Thank you for coming down right away.
It's okay. Anything we can do.
Are you gonna find Mandy?
I hope so, Chloe.
Can you tell us why you
were meeting her in the park this afternoon?
I wasn't.
You're not in trouble, honey.
But we have to do everything we can to find Mandy.
Why did Mandy leave Joey at school
to come meet you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You were I.M.'ing with her right after school.
We have the records.
No. I-I wasn't.
Chloe, you two are texting all the time.
Please, just tell the detectives.
We don't text anymore, mom.
Mandy got a new phone so we could I.M.
And what did you I.M.?
I told you. I didn't.
I had volleyball practice right after school --
No phones allowed.
Okay.
Can you take a look at these messages between you and mandy?
That's not me.
Look. There's a "U."
I'm "Suprgrrl." G-r-r. No "U."
Someone was pretending to be Chloe.
To lure Mandy to the park.
They knew her eye would skate right over that extra "U"
while she was I.M.'ing her best friend,
just like ours did.
This whole thing has been a setup from start to finish.
And I don't get all this texting and You-ing and I'M-ing and
I.M.'ing.
Whatever.
But I'll tell you one thing.
That kid was stalked.
Whoever took her knew everything about her,
right down to her best friend's handle.
Screen name.
Okay, will you stop correcting me
and think about what it means?
It means she was targeted.
I mean, they knew her schedule down to the very minute.
They even got her to ditch her little brother
so they could get her alone.
Still might be better than a random snatch.
How? Random, they kill her.
This kind? They use her, abuse her,
like jane doe downstairs,
then kill her.
I'm just saying it buys us some time.
God, I hope so.
Okay, we got a counterfeit screen name -- suprgurrl97.
Already trying to track it.
Jane, I want to show you something.
Blunt-force trauma to the right side of the body.
So her right side was facing her attacker.
Yes, but there's no bruising on her left side.
Why is that significant?
So she was fighting like this.
She was left-handed, Jane.
Yeah. I'm left-handed.
Why would I expose my weaker side,
defend myself with my weaker right hand?
Exactly. You wouldn't.
Unless you were holding something...
or someone.
The tears on the sweatshirt.
She might have been holding someone close
with her stronger arm
as she fought off her attacker.
It's Mandy. It -- it fits the timeline.
Oh, god.
She died trying to protect a complete stranger.
The DNA from the tears will tell us if it's Mandy.
Well, we don't have that kind of time.
I mean, w-what about her other clothing?
I mean, maybe there's something on that
that connects this girl to Mandy.
Everyone is working all night on this.
I promised Dan that we'd find her.
I know she's out there, okay?
We can't let her end up like this girl.
We just can't.
Got something, Dr. Isles.
A positive match on the hair we found on the jeans.
Who does it match?
Amanda Mateo.
She's alive, Maura. I know she is.
So, this guy lurks online,
watching young girls chat with each other?
Like shooting little fish in a barrel.
They have no idea how vulnerable they are.
Did you find this bastard online?
Who is he?
We don't know yet.
Well, tell me what you do know, Jane,
because what I'm thinking in my head is far worse
than anything you can say.
We know he was chatting with Mandy for two days,
Pretending to be Chloe.
He knew her schedule.
Did he know her dad wasn't around?
Come on.
Got an I.P. Address.
It's a cafe with free public internet service.
Public internet service. Great.
Wait. No. Washington street.
That's -- that's like a quarter-mile
from where we found jane doe's body.
Got to be his stomping ground.
That's something, Dan.
It's not enough.
W-where you going?
To find her.
Let him go, Jane. He needs something to do.
Where you going?
Check on Nicole.
All right. Thanks.
Hey, Maura, look for anything on jane doe
that can narrow down a location around Stony Brook.
Okay, thanks.
How about I give you and Joey a ride home?
I'll call you the second we have something.
No! I'm not going anywhere until you people find my daughter!
Let me make you a cup of coffee.
Thank you.
Sorry, Vince. That was harsh.
Nah, it's all right.
You can yell at me anytime you need to.
Dan blames me.
I blame me.
Where is he? Where is Dan?
He's out in the streets, doing what he does best, Nicole --
Digging, looking for Amanda.
That's what I want to do.
I want to look for her. I want to scream her name.
I can't leave Joey, though.
The job...
It's crushed him...
Crushed me.
Hey, I've had three wives leave me because of the job.
It's hard being married to a cop.
Dan just kept doing deep-cover drug assignments,
disappearing on us.
The job was more important to him than we were.
That is not true, Nicole.
It sucks you in.
And it's who he is.
Ah. I know.
I just feel so alone all the time.
I mean, even --
Even before we split up, I felt like a single mother,
raising our kids without him.
And I know that he loves them.
He loves you, too.
I made a fresh pot.
Please eat.
You've really been so kind.
But you can go home.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm part of a cop family, too.
She has fluorosis of the enamel --
Discoloration of her permanent teeth.
She grew up in an area with high concentrations
of natural fluoride in the water.
Well water.
Yes.
So she's from a rural area or a farming community maybe.
Yeah, but we got to narrow it down more than that.
Frost has already been through over
a thousand missing-children reports.
We'll start with Massachusetts.
Try Worcester County,
Berkshire County, Hampshire County.
Okay, slow down. Slow down. Uh...
No missing kids in Worcester county
matching jane doe's description.
What are you doing?
Checking water-quality reports
in massachusetts and surrounding states.
Nothing in Hampshire county or Berkshire county.
Maybe if I narrow down the search parameters
to 1.4 milligrams per liter.
Okay, that helps.
Here it is. What about, uh, Windham County, Connecticut?
Windham County.
Anything?
Maybe. 13-year-old girl disappeared four years ago.
Maura, didn't you say she was about 17 years old?
Frost, you got a picture?
Right here.
There she is. Sophie James.
Sophie James.
She's been missing four years.
I'm gonna call her family,
have them come get her and take her home.
I'm so sorry.
Don't be.
Her mother and I have been praying for a long time
to get this phone call in the middle of the night --
Just to know.
It's hell...to not know.
I understand.
That's Sophie.
That's my daughter.
Can I go to her?
Sure.
I'm so sorry, Mr. James.
Thank you.
I've been carrying this around for four years.
It's her dental records...
Photos.
Where's she been? Who took my daughter?
We don't know yet.
I saw another family upstairs.
They're missing a child, aren't they?
Yes.
A girl, 13.
We, uh...
Think your daughter might have been killed
trying to protect that girl.
That sounds like my girl, Sophie.
Find that girl, will you?
Don't let those parents go through this.
Anything?
No, not yet.
You were right. He just keeps on drawing.
Oh, wow. I like how the waves move against the lighthouse.
Did your family take a vacation in Maine?
My dad's always working.
No. No, we've never been. Why?
I guess you like lighthouses, then, huh?
Not really.
Joey, let me see.
He is drawing a lot of lighthouses.
He's never done that before.
Joey...
Is this the car that took Mandy?
Look at the smoke. What's the smoke from?
From the back of the car.
Tailpipe.
No, it's the muffler.
Joey, d-did the car sound like,
"Pop-pop, pop-pop," Like that?
Mm-hmm. It was loud.
The car had a broken muffler.
Uh, Nicole, can I borrow your laptop?
Yes, of course.
Well, maybe he saw the license plate,
but he doesn't realize it.
Okay.
Did the blue car maybe have a Connecticut license plate
that looked like this?
Yeah. Maybe.
I'll let you know if we find something.
Good job.
Frost, track Connecticut vanity plates,
the lighthouse ones.
See how many were cited for defective equipment in the last month.
I think the kidnappers' car had a bum muffler.
Think we're gonna find her on that?
Hey, they caught the Son of Sam on a parking ticket.
State troopers are relentless on equipment-violation tickets.
Found two -- a 2000 minivan...
And an '89 dodge dynasty.
It's blue, Jane.
Who's it registered to?
Heidi Rodman, 35.
Show me her face.
Where's Amanda?
You got the plate, Korsak?
Yeah, putting out a bolo on it.
We'll have every cop in the state on it in two seconds.
Hey, put out a bolo on a Connecticut plate --
936-romeo-zulu-baker...
Let's get all the locals to her New London house.
It's not gonna help.
Why? Y-you've got her address right there.
800 Harbor View Drive.
It's bogus. The address is to a shopping mall.
Oh, damn it. Is she married?
No marriage certificate on file. No joint accounts.
All right, print up her driver's-license photo.
I want to show that to Joey.
You got it.
Take your time.
That's her.
Great job, Joey. You did good.
We're gonna get her.
It's her. Joey made her.
Yeah! Good.
Is that operations?
Yeah.
Korsak. What do you got?
Come on, please.
Okay. Thanks.
Walking beat just spotted the car
Parked on River Street in Stony Brook.
Yes!
Frost, call dispatch.
Have the walking beat keep an eye on that car.
Keep everybody out of that area.
We're gonna follow Heidi Rodman straight to Amanda.
Bring her home.
There it is.
Walking beat's keeping an eye on it.
Have they spotted the driver yet?
No.
Well, then, we wait.
And that car will take us straight to Mandy.
That's her.
Oh, no! It's Martinez!
Oh, no, no! Come on! No!
What is he doing?!
God, no.
Hands on the wheel! Let me see your hands!
Do you have any idea what you've just done?
She's wanted. There's a bolo out on this car.
You don't listen to your damn radio?!
Get out of the car!
We called everybody off this location!
Sorry. I --
Where's Mandy? Where is she?!
She's dead.
Where is he? Where's he at?
You should have let me go back.
Amanda might still be alive if you let me go back to him.
He'll be mad.
Look at this.
Camera equipment. A lot of it.
Oh, you a pornographer, too, Heidi?
Oh, you're gonna talk to me.
Sophie James. He stepped on her neck.
Crushed her trachea.
Did you watch him kill her?
Help hold her down?
Did you watch him do the same thing to Mandy?
He's a prophet.
You can't understand.
Let me in there!
Let me in there!
Where's my daughter?! Where's my daughter?!
You hear me, you bitch?!
You killed my daughter!
You killed her!
Jane! I'm gonna kill her, Jane!
Where's my daughter?!
You know who that is? That's Mandy's father.
If you don't start talking,
I'm gonna open that door and let him in here.
Now, where is he?
It's too late.
You've angered the prophet.
She's gone.
Where's Dan?
Thought we were gonna have to lock him up.
He's downstairs with Nicole.
You guys get anything?
No. Nothing.
They're processing the car.
We'll get him, Jane.
I kept her dental records,
but here are Sophie's photos for your case file.
Crime techs are collecting that piece of crap's clothing,
checking for trace evidence.
Hey, Frost, pull up Mandy's profile page.
Look at that.
Mandy and Sophie both played soccer.
Is Mandy left-handed?
I don't know. Why?
I think she is.
Her left hand,
the dominant hand, is holding the soccer ball.
Sophie was left-handed.
Well, so, you're saying
he's targeting left-handed soccer players?
Come on, Maura. That's just crazy.
I don't know.
The alphabet killer went after girls
who had the same initial in their first and last names.
And there's a lot of mythology
associated with left-handedness
that might trigger something in a sociopath.
The devil is often portrayed as being left-handed.
Yeah, but Mandy and Sophie lived 100 miles apart.
How would he know if they were left- or right-handed?
The soccer -- I mean, the coach would know. Yeah, look.
Mandy played left wing.
Mandy and Sophie are four years apart,
from two different states.
Those are official player photos.
They're in the same position.
No, wait. The camera equipment in the trunk.
He's a photographer.
He takes pictures of kids.
Maybe Game World Photography
took Mandy's team photos, too.
Could you check that?
On it.
No one ever notices the photographer.
And he's around kids all the time.
He keeps looking until he finds the one he wants.
Owen Lamb is the owner.
Is Mandy's school team on his list of clients?
Yeah. Right here.
Owen Lamb. 617 Atkins Road,
Stony Brook.
Let's get him. If I can't bring Mandy home alive,
we're at least gonna get him.
Thank you, Sophie.
Let's get this bastard.
Clear.
Mandy. Oh, honey.
Mandy. Oh, sweetie. You okay?
It's all right. There. There we go.
It's okay, honey.
We'll get you out of here, all right?
Oh, your mommy and daddy
are gonna be so happy to see you, okay?
All right? There. There, baby. It's okay.
We're gonna get you home, all right?
We're gonna get you out of here.
We're gonna get you home.
Oh, honey, it's over.
Who's that?
Mom.
Mandy.
Oh, my sweet baby girl.
Baby. Are you okay?
Let me see you.
Daddy.
I am never getting married...
or having children.
You think that'll protect you?
No.
You're okay.
You brought her back to me...
back to us.
We all did.
I'm never gonna be able to thank you.
Yes, you can.
Go back to your family.
Thanks, partner.
Maybe they'll get back together.
Oh, god, I hope so.
Bye.
Bye, Mandy. Go home, baby.
Well, that was a long day.
I guess 'cause it started yesterday.
Now can we get a beer?
Really?
