♬I wish I would have met you.♬
♬Now it's a little late.♬
♬What you could have taught me?♬
♬I could have saved some face.♬
♬They think that your early ending.♬
♬Was all wrong?♬
♬Hey, man.♬
♬Nice shot.♬
♬Hey, man.♬
The plan failed. We can't decode the message.
Call Raymond Reddington.
From Wu Jing.
Good God. Not here.
The gentleman I usually contract with is unavailable --
Stung by a manta ray off the barrier reef in Belize.
I have another tech in mind.
This needs to be done quickly.
Today?
Speak with Luli about the replacement I'm offering.
Conduct your due diligence.
If things are in order, we can proceed as discussed.
I prefer to play with myself in private.
Are you okay?
Yeah, sorry.
I'm just a little distracted.
No, that's -- that's all right.
I'm... sitting here talking about what happened to me
like it only happened to me.
But it happened to us both.
It's just a little weird to be home because...
Lizzy, a man came into our home.
I know. I'm sorry.
I wish I could tell you more.
I want to tell you more. I --
So, tell me something. Who was he?
He's gone. He was killed.
So it's over?
Yes.
Look, I love you.
That's Ellie.
I just hate that there are things you have to hide from me.
Good morning!
Hope you're hungry. I'm making breakfast.
Oh, you don't have to do that.
Are you kidding?
A good omelet has healing powers.
Bruce and Melissa are bringing over dinner tonight.
That's incredibly cool of you.
Hey, friends don't let friends starve
when they've been stabbed by violent psychopaths.
How's he doing?
I'm sitting right here.
I'm not asking you.
You'll say fine,
because that's what you do. You're a good actor.
Karen's covering my classes.
We're gonna eat and then head over to physical therapy.
I got to run. Ellie, we owe you.
So true.
You know I wouldn't go if I didn't have to.
Look, whatever they pulled you into,
the sooner you get it over with, the sooner we get our life back.
Okay.
Bye.
Slug and casing from a 9-millimeter.
Can you run these
and see if they match any crimes in our system?
An opportunity has come our way.
Yesterday, the Chinese killed a C.I.A. agent in Shanghai.
They took his computer,
which they thought could decode a message they intercepted.
It couldn't.
They've asked me to help.
Oh, Rodrick is a dear old friend.
I'm sorry.
You're decoding C.I.A. messages on behalf of the Chinese?
Now, you see, you make it sound like treason.
So black and white. It's not. It's green.
The fact is, American secrets are for sale
by an assortment of reputable vendors, myself included.
If I don't do this, someone else will.
The man who's paying me is called Wu Jing.
Perhaps you've heard of him.
Formerly, he worked for the Ministry of State Security.
He's not officially sanctioned by the Chinese.
But unofficially, he's contracted
to take out rival agents -- American, British.
The message likely contains the name of another agent.
Do you expect me to believe that --
A secret meeting with the mysterious Wu Jing?
Intriguing, isn't it?
He's a myth.
That's what they said about deep throat and the G-spot.
I assure you Wu Jing is quite real, and he's hired me.
Now you have the chance to catch him.
I've already forwarded them your cover.
What? What cover?
Carolyn Givins,
PhD in applied physics from M.I.T..
I've told them you're my new encryption specialist.
You're asking me to betray the life of an American agent.
Listen, this is a guy who the intelligence community
has been talking about for decades
as if he were a figment.
You don't even know if he's real or not.
Well, he is real -- very.
And I'm giving you the opportunity to grab him.
Now, the good news is he's not even in China.
He's right here in your own backyard.
If we play our cards right,
I can still make Lisbon by breakfast.
Rodrick, both.
Michael Alvarado, Kevin Wyatt,
Bryce Jensen.
Three agents based in China, three covers blown.
According to Reddington,
all were murdered by a man named Wu Jing.
Who is Wu Jing?
China has a one-child policy.
They say that Wu Jing was a second child.
So they gave him away, denied he was ever born.
He was invisible to his family.
Wu Jing made a life working in a business
where invisibility was an incredible asset.
Reddington's told you he can find this guy?
He claims Wu Jing has hired him to decode a message
that the Chinese have intercepted from the C.I.A.
He believes that it might contain the identify
of another one of our assets in China.
I think we should move on this.
I'm not prepared to do this.
I understand you have reservations.
Reservations?
You're asking me to spy on a notorious spy killer
while pretending to be an expert in cryptography,
which I know nothing about.
Reddington insists on you.
I'm sorry.
Look at those pictures.
If there is a name in that message,
there's gonna be another face in that file.
That'll be on you.
I'll be back in a second. I just need to grab my purse.
I thought it was on the counter.
Hello?
Hey. Did you find it?
Oh, yeah, sorry. I'm coming.
Okay. Say I do this, what's in it for me?
Look at you, camel trading like a Bedouin.
If I'm gonna help you, I want something in return.
Such as?
The truth. Just once.
I want to know why you chose me.
Well, then, we need to move quickly.
Things are already in play.
WDCJ --
a small radio station five miles from here.
The building was purchased six years ago
by a corporation fronting for the Chinese government.
I'm sorry. Wait.
You're telling us that Wu Jing is running a spy ring
out of a radio station?
We'll meet Wu Jing.
You'll decode the message and transmit it to your team.
If I decode the message,
that means the Chinese get it, too.
Exactly -- both you and the Chinese
will know the name of the agent
for which the message was intended,
and the race begins.
We try to save him. The Chinese try to kill him.
We could give them a false message.
No.
That could work. We could send them in the wrong direction.
I said no.
The Chinese may not know what the message is,
but they certainly know what it isn't.
We do it for real, or we don't do it at all.
Great plan, except, as I have said,
I know nothing about encryption.
You're a very quick study.
I have a guy who can help you with that.
The Chinese will give you an intercepted message
on one of these.
Insert it, and it will prompt you to connect a data locker.
Shun Lee says it's like a magic box.
A magic box?
The data locker applies a key to the message.
It'll take a moment,
but the decoded message will appear on your laptop.
How do I get the message out?
You don't. The computer does it for you.
All you need is a satellite connection.
If you don't have a satellite connection, use this.
It's a remote mirroring program.
It'll give our tech on the outside control of the system.
It's gonna be okay.
Great. You're rocking the Mandarin.
Xie xie.
Three minutes till the meeting, sir.
Where the hell is Reddington? He's late.
He's gonna blow this whole damn thing.
Do you smoke?
No.
Well, you do now.
Or at least you're trying to quit.
This is C.I.A. equipment. It's brand-new.
It looks like a nicotine patch,
but it's a very sensitive transmitter.
It has a range of 300 yards, and it's a plastic polymer,
which means it won't show up if it gets wanded.
And if you're wrong?
I'm not wrong.
Where the hell is he?
He was supposed to be here an hour --
What are we waiting for?
Surveillance one, are you in position?
Roger that. In position.
Satellite feed up and running.
Right this way.
Here we go.
Sorry, sir. Protocol.
Miss, please.
Thank you. Sir?
DARPA tracking chip, 8-millimeter tag.
I was taken by Somali pirates last March,
spent three weeks in a shipping container.
The first two were a nightmare.
The third one was actually quite pleasant.
Even so, that won't happen again.
If you have a clean razor blade and some morphine,
I'll remove it.
That won't be necessary, but I am going to need
a biometric print scan from your associate.
She's with me.
Understood.
But my orders are to scan any new visitors.
What database is this being run against?
All of them.
What's happening?
They are running her prints.
Can you intercept them?
I don't know.
So, you went with the gray?
Okay.
Vanish.
Follow me.
As you can see, we've made some improvements.
Oh, your DARPA chip won't work where you're going.
Wu Jing will explain when you get there.
Get where?
What the hell just happened?
We lost them.
We can't just lose them.
What happened to our signal?
They seem to be descending,
which doesn't make any sense.
The blueprints don't show any underground space.
Get that signal back.
How far down do you think we're going?
Far enough.
My friend.
Don't be cheeky, Wu Jing. You don't have any friends.
My associate.
Ms. Givins.
Professor Robins only works with the best.
Oh, he was an amazing teacher.
I was so sorry to hear that he passed away.
You've made some changes.
We had to increase security. - I can imagine --
Four American agents killed in the past year and a half.
You've been busy.
I presume nothing gets in or out,
no radio or satellite transmissions.
Nothing but trust.
Please don't take offense.
I can't risk American surveillance.
Only our systems are hard-wired to the outside world.
Let's get to work.
I once had a bad experience in a deep hole in the ground.
Jin Sun, my new senior cryptographer.
We expected standard RSA encryption,
but this was something stronger.
The government's been experimenting
with better factoring algorithms.
It's only a matter of time before RSA's obsolete.
You're right. It is.
I'll just need a few moments to set up my equipment.
This way.
They're trying, but still nothing.
Either the Chinese are scrambling our signals,
or Liz and Red are out of range.
I thought your equipment had a range of 300 yards.
It does, but maybe they've built a bunker
that deep under the building.
We're getting played.
That signal went dark because Red and Liz wanted it to.
That's not likely.
How long can we wait to find out?
Is it possible they could be in danger?
That's another reason not to wait.
Keep all insertion teams on standby.
If we don't hear from Agent Keen in five minutes, we're going in.
We ready yet?
Do you get home much, Jin Sun?
Not for two years.
Oh, that must be hard. It certainly would be for me.
I don't even have a phone.
I insist on delivering all of my messages in person.
What province are you from?
From Yunnan.
Oh, beautiful part of the country.
I spent a month in silent meditation
at a monastery just outside of Kunming.
探员会被杀害
探员会被杀害
It was a wonderful escape
from the distractions of everyday life.
I can't imagine the distractions one might encounter down here.
Can you?
No. I can't.
Excellent.
I think we're almost ready. This should be fun.
What the hell is that?
I swear, if I run into the same trouble
I had with you in Hong Kong...
In all the years you and I have known each other,
I've never put you in a position like this.
You know how I conduct my business.
I don't need this kind of crap.
You assured me this place was secure.
It is.
Then what the hell is that?!
That van.
It was there when we arrived, and it's still there.
That is the FBI.
With all the scans and wands
and this elevator you've built that goes down to middle earth,
and you don't even bother to sweep the street
around your building? This is nonsense.
Calm down, old friend.
You're under surveillance!
If the FBI was outside, it's because you led them here.
I've been moving comfortably through the world
for the past 20 years without a trace.
And now some two-bit spy killer
is gonna put my life and business in jeopardy?
We have activity. Everybody, heads up.
We're made. Your 2 o'clock. Break it down. 15 seconds.
We got to go. Pack it up.
You!
They know we're here.
Maybe,
or maybe the van's just
been there too long and they're being careful.
I don't like it. We're going in on my signal.
Unbelievable.
You see? Nothing.
Now...can we continue?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
To put Ms. Givins and I at risk, it's unprofessional.
I've reached my limit.
Enough!
What?
Okay. Okay. You know, I'm sorry.
I've had a rough day.
Unbelievable.
Should we do this?
Let's roll. E.T.A. -- one minute.
The message.
Don't you miss the good old days
with the pay phones and the brush pasts?
30 seconds out.
Wait. I've got something.
She's using the remote mirroring program.
Meera's contact gave her.
Uh, hang on. This isn't her computer.
It looks like one of the Chinese systems.
Can you see the C.I.A. message?
Yes, sir, and a lot more than that. Downloading now.
10 seconds out.
Okay, all units, stand down.
I repeat, stand down.
I repeat, all units stand down.
Standing down.
There's your next target -- kill number five.
Henry Cho.
We have the message. The target is Henry Cho.
All right. The clock is ticking.
I want everything we can find on this guy.
This was sent from a C.I.A. server,
delivered to a server at the Nanjing Grand Hotel.
So, Mr. Cho, why is the C.I.A. sending you secret messages
at your hotel?
Hold on. This guy's not an agent.
He's Chinese-American, an architect.
An architect?
Then why the hell is he talking to the C.I.A.?
Because we asked for his help.
Henry Cho works for Zhongku Construction.
Not in China, here in D.C.
Zhongku -- they're a huge construction company.
They design buildings all over the world.
His immigration file says he's been to the company headquarters
6 times in the last 10 months.
That's why the C.I.A. reached out to him.
Zhongku's designing a new government building in Shanghai.
We asked Henry to use his access to get us the plans.
Thanks to him, our ops bugged the entire city military commission.
Let me get this straight.
This guy's not a trained operative.
He's just a... contractor?
A civilian.
Where is he now?
Here.
Immigration says he left China three days ago,
a return flight to Dulles Airport.
Thank you, Aram. You're welcome.
Go get him.
Zhongku Construction.
Henry Cho, please.
It's very important that I speak to him immediately.
His brother, Xiaoping, has been in a car accident.
He's at our Fairview Property with his son.
I can try to call him --
There's no answer on his cell.
Call the company. Find out where he is.
My friend, I can't thank you enough.
This is all the thanks I require.
Get your things. It's time to go.
Leave it.
Lock it down.
Stop!
You were right.
Maybe that was the F.B.I. outside.
In fact, maybe they're not just outside.
Maybe they're right here in this room.
Think hard before you accuse anybody of anything.
A few minutes ago,
contact was made from this room to an FBI server.
A message I worked so hard to intercept
was sent to the Americans.
Well, all my instincts said it was her.
I trust my instincts.
You're smart.
The one responsible was smart,
but our systems are smarter.
Any contact with a government server is flagged for review.
So...
I know who betrayed us.
He's not at the office.
He's with a client at a property at Fairview and Wallace.
Try him again.
So, over here, they're gonna make some windows.
And out here...
there's gonna be a balcony
that runs the length of the whole build--
You said we were gonna get ice cream.
Okay.
Let me just show you something else first.
Get him up.
I thought you were loyal to us.
I don't understand.
The message was sent from your system, Jin Sun.
T-that's not possible.
That's not possible.
It is, and not just one message.
You gave them everything,
files we've worked on for months!
Nobody else had access.
We have to do something.
Quiet.
We can't just let them do this.
You --
As entertaining as all this has been,
we really do need to leave now.
The next sound you hear is gonna be the FBI knocking on your door,
and I, for one, am not gonna be here.
Wu Jing! Look at me!
You don't kill one of my people.
Now I have to kill one of yours.
The moment he sent that message,
he became worthless to you.
You would have beaten him for another 20 minutes
and then killed him yourself.
But if I let you kill a contractor of mine,
I'll lose the trust of all my others,
and that's just bad business.
So if you kill her, you better kill me.
Or I'm going to kill you.
You hired me to do a job. It's done.
Now let's get out of here.
Follow me.
I have another way out.
Let's go get you some ice cream, all right?
Okay.
Hello?
Mr. Cho, this is Agent Meera Malik with the C.I.A.
C.I.A.? I don't understand.
You're not supposed to be calling me on this line.
Listen to me. You are in danger.
Can you hear me? The Chinese have your name.
There are men on their way to your location.
We're on the 12th floor.
Stay where you are.
We're coming to get you.
Stay hidden. We're just minutes out.
Dad?
Come here. Come here. Let's go.
I've been building this place for three years,
and now my operation is burned.
So build another.
Sir, I've got them.
The microchip in Red's neck just came online
and the bug we put on Agent Keen.
They're out of the building, moving west on Danforth.
Where the hell are they going?
Just send agents to intercept them.
Get underneath. Get underneath.
Listen. Listen.
Don't move, all right?
Just don't move.
No, put your hand in.
No!
Stop! Dad!
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Let him go! Let my son go!
Please! Please! Just let my son go! Please!
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. I'll do anything.
Just let him go. It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right. I promise. I promise.
Dad!
Ressler, clear!
Ressler, clear?
I'm good. Thanks.
Thank you.
Thank you for all you've done for us.
I can get us out of the country.
That's very kind,
but I'm sure we can muddle through on our own.
Anywhere in the shade up here would be fine.
I fear I've disappointed you.
The deal was for us
to actually catch the criminals on the blacklist,
and now Wu Jing is as good as halfway to Beijing.
I don't think so.
Is everything okay?
We're fine.
Move! Move! Let me see your hands!
Get out! Get out! Get out!
Up on the car!
The package is secure.
Suspect in custody now.
Luli can stay with me.
Dembe will take you wherever you need to go.
You didn't have to kill him.
I believe I will always do
whatever I feel I have to do to keep you alive.
I held up my end of the deal. Now it's your turn.
You owe me an answer.
What's the question?
Why me?
Because of your father.
What does that mean?
Did you know my father?
Have the two of you met somehow?
I wish the answer were as simple as the question seems.
But the truth is, the question isn't simple, either.
I share your frustration.
You act like we're the same. You're wrong.
I have a life, people who care about me.
But you... This is all you have.
I have you.
You okay?
I'll live.
Look, I just wanted to say, uh...
maybe I've had some doubts about you.
Maybe I haven't done the best job of keeping them to myself,
but what you did today was good work.
Thanks.
If you didn't get that message out when you did,
Henry Cho wouldn't be alive.
Whatever else went down in there,
you should feel good about that.

Any tests, reports, or files--
Anything she requests gets sent to us first.
She brought a bullet and a shell casing into ballistics.
At her level, the results were classified.
But that's the full report.
This isn't just classified.
Any briefings on this homicide

I just wanted to apologize for this morning.
It's okay.
No, no, no. I was wrong.
It's your job, and, uh,

Because-- because we'll survive, like always.

I got to see a man about some lasagna.
