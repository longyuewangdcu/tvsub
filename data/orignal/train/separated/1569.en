You need to make a bold move.
You put your underwear in my pocket.
I was, you know, flirting.
So what, you're just like a tease, is that it?
No, I...
Thanks for wasting my time.
I see you've met Hurricane Dani.
You have a girlfriend?
She's more like a sober buddy.
I love you.
If I have to wait a while till I'm gonna be with you again...
Well, then that's what I'm gonna do.
I never realized until today that for us to be together,
you have to give up everything.
If you want to make some fast bank? Why don't we sell some IDs?
Isn't that like a felony?
Your mom's a school veep. You have access to her keys.
We have access to the idea maker at Anchor Beach.
Ugh! I hate being late to school.
Then stop hogging the bathroom.
Callie took longer than me.
Yeah, that happened.
And in other news,
the laws of space and time no longer apply in the bathroom.
I don't care who's to blame.
From now on, the car leaves at 7:30.
Whoever's not in it can walk to school.
I'm always ready.
I know, honey, that's why you're my favorite.
Hey!
Go!
Um, so I was wondering
would I be able to go to Daphne's after school?
Michelle at Girls United is taking Kiara
and said she could pick me up and bring me home.
I don't think we're that comfortable having you
go to someone's apartment unsupervised.
What if they come to our house?
OK.
I can see if they can come to me then.
Just one more day until weigh-in, Foster.
Do you have what it takes?
Can you resist pastry perfection?
You're gonna have to try a different trick.
Or some better food.
I mean, scones, really?
Yeah, really.
And it's a family recipe, have some respect.
Eat away. Ice runs through these veins.
OK, Ice Man. Hmm? Hmm?
What are you...
Really? Really!
Yep, yep.
You have a girlfriend, you know?
Thank you, Captain Obvious. Emma's just a friend.
That better be all she is.
Thank you, again, so much
for letting Callie come back to Anchor Beach.
I know the last thing you need is more paperwork.
Well, actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.
I need to fill out a progress report for Callie's P.O.
She has been here every single day.
He's looking for more than just attendance,
and to be honest, I am, too. She needs to participate.
A club, sports, student government, anything.
Callie needs to show that
she wants to be a part of this community.
I understand that, and we have spoken to her
about getting more involved in school.
But not every kid is a joiner.
And not every kid is a runaway, either.
Look, I know you and Stef have your hands full with five teenagers.
We are managing.
Mariana and Jesus have both been suspended this year,
and Jude barely passed his proficiency test.
Brandon is the only one...
That what, isn't a normal teenager?
Everyone's kids make mistakes, Karina.
Are mine supposed to be held to a higher standard
because I work here?
Lena, that's not what I'm saying.
What are you saying?
I want Callie to succeed here.
I really do.
And the more roots that she puts down,
the harder they are to pull up,
and the easier my paperwork gets.
Oh. I forgot about the fire drill.
I know the school's not really on fire,
but the drill doesn't work unless we pretend.
Of course, Vice Principal. Going.
第一季 第十七集
Hey. Did you get in? Did it work?
We got a problem. Oh, hell. We got two problems.
A cop. Be cool.
Hey, B, how are you?
Hey, Mom.
What are you doing here?
I'm having lunch with Mama.
Uh... This is Vico.
How are you?
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Uh... class.
New friend?
Nah, not really.
How are you? I miss you.
I'm good.
Come to have dinner with us tomorrow at the house?
I can't, actually.
Come on, why not?
I have a "getting to know you" thing with Dad and his girlfriend, so
Your dad has a girlfriend?
That's nice. How long has that been going on?
I don't know.
It must be serious if he's asking you to meet her, right?
Well, we met before. We just haven't...
Oh, I see. She's been by the apartment.
Is she spending the night there?
Mom, I don't...
No, no, B, listen.
You know, you're living with your dad,
and I just want to make sure that it's a healthy environment.
I'm not gonna get in the middle of this.
OK.
So if you wanna know about dad's girlfriend, ask him.
Will do.
OK.
How old is she?
Mom.
What, is she 30? At least?
Come on. Love you.
I love you.
You know, it just...
It's hard enough with Brandon not living under our roof.
His father has got girls going in and out,
and coming and going.
One girl. One girl.
Remember the pet psychic?
Oh, God. She was young.
Yeah, she said that our cat used to be Cleopatra in a former life.
Remember that?
I forgot about that.
Mmm, here's one.
"African-American, six foot,
Masters in poetry. Loves dogs."
You know, if she's gonna be spending the night at the apartment,
exactly what kind of an example is that setting for Brandon?
We should definitely meet her.
African-American?
Yeah...
No, I just...
You know, if we're... can't have the baby together,
just that maybe I thought we could find a donor
that has more of my characteristics.
You mean white?
And smart and loyal and charming
and sweet and loving and caring.
See, the thing is that I'm half white
so if we go with a donor who's also white,
then the baby might not end up looking like me at all.
But it has to look like...
No, no, no, I get it. I get it.
It's just, you know, it's going to be our baby.
And that's fine. That's all that matters.
It doesn't have to look like me.
So African-American it is. Totally.
Let's do this.
Hey, friend.
Hey,
pal.
So do we...
...should we eat lunch together?
I don't know.
That kind of seems like advanced-level friendship.
Well, it was a good effort.
Yeah, baby steps.
I can't believe Kelsey got the friends in our break-up.
It's 'cause they're scared of her, right?
Yeah. I don't blame them. She's scary.
Meanwhile, Zac's acting like
I set his lighting plans on fire or something,
which is lame. He's the one who left me at the cast party.
Yeah, he left because he thought you two were on a date.
No, we're just... You came with us.
Yeah, he wasn't too happy about that.
Oh, no.
What?
Zac was there, when Chase went upstairs, after I...
after I put my underwear in Chase's pocket.
Wait! You did what?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Look, and the whole time, I was on a date,
with Zac.
Yeah. A pretty bad one.
Hey. What happened? Did you get caught?
No, there was an alarm.
It wasn't on today, but it will be after hours.
So we're screwed?
Unless you can get the code.
Sure. I'll ask my mom.
She's gotta have it written down somewhere, right?
It's worth it, dude.
The machine works like a charm.
出生日期 1991年11月29日 有效期至 11/29/2015
OK. I'll see what I can do.
You got huevos, Foster.
With a cop and a vice principal for a mom.
It's only a one-time thing.
Once I get the money I need, I'm out.
Totally. But first things first.
We're putting that bad boy to the test.
We're hitting the bars tonight.
Zac.
I have a newspaper meeting, like now, so...
I'm sorry,
for the misunderstanding at the cast party.
I didn't know that you thought we were together together.
I didn't think that.
You didn't?
No.
We worked on the play together,
we went to the party as friends.
Good. OK. So we're OK?
No.
You don't ditch a friend to go hook-up with some no-talent toolbox.
OK, I did not hook up with Chase.
Whatever, Mariana,
don't worry about it. The play's over.
We don't need to be friends.
You told people?
What are you talking about?
The pant... The panties.
What? No.
Is this because I didn't hook up with you?
Look, it wasn't me. You must have told someone.
Or somebody saw you. You weren't exactly stealth about it.
No, you're lying.
You know how I know you're lying?
Because you're a terrible actor.
Hey! Come in.
What's up?
Dang! Look at you.
She cleans up good, doesn't she?
My P.O. Makes me wear this for interviews.
Feel like I'm in a Halloween costume.
So how'd it go?
We'll see.
Well, thanks for coming to me.
I can only be here or at school, so...
It's kind of like I never left Girls United.
Ain't nothing about this place like Girls United.
You ran away from here?
Um, you guys want some food?
I can, like, make us sandwiches or something.
Just glad I'm not eating ramen.
So how is Independent Living?
It's a challenge. They don't pay enough to cover my bills.
No one's trying to hire a kid out of juvie,
no matter how many recommendation letters Rita or Michelle write.
And they won't give you Tasha back without a job?
I get a supervised visit with her next week.
Yeah. I want to buy her this tricycle,
like the one I had when I was kid.
So she won't forget me while I'm trying to get her back.
That's why I need a job.
So what's up with you?
Um, you know.
No, we don't know.
It's all good. I'm supposed to be making friends
and joining clubs, I guess.
I don't really have anything in common
with the kids I go to school with, so...
You didn't have much in common with us, either,
but we're all friends.
And Brandon?
Not an issue.
He moved in with his dad.
Not an issue?
He's everywhere you look, and you're in school with him.
Yeah, no, Brandon and me, we're good.
Well, Kiara has some good news.
I got me a foster family.
What?
Yeah.
All because of you.
That picture you took of me in photography class,
they used it on the website.
Um, it's just a picture.
No, your pictures are different.
They're more real.
Your picture brought out all of my inner beauty.
The pictures CPS takes of us
makes us all look like dogs at the pound.
Well, hello, ladies.
Hi, Mrs. Foster.
Hi.
Go ahead and call me Stef, all right?
Glad that you guys could come and visit. That's wonderful.
You want anything else?
No, thanks.
Well, if you change your mind, just help yourself, right?
Michelle's gonna pick us up at any moment.
So we should probably wait for her. Thanks.
Yeah, I'm gonna walk you out so I can say hi to Michelle.
Thanks, Mrs... Stef.
You're welcome. Bye.
What'd I tell you, man? These things are golden.
Fine, we got past the doors,
but what if someone else figures us out?
We could get arrested.
No one is getting arrested.
I'll have a Rusty Nail.
Yeah, I'll have a Cosmopolitan?
Well or shelf?
What do you recommend?
Top shelf.
You know what is gonna get us busted?
You standing there looking all uptight and guilty.
Hell, I'm about to arrest you.
Our IDs kick ass. Enjoy this moment.
Yeah, you're right.
Good.
So why did you need the money so fast?
Long story.
Bars were invented for long stories.
Nice. It's like drinking with my little sister.
$12?
Top shelf, bro.
So I meant to tell you about the conversation I had with Karina today
about how we have our hands full with all these kids.
Yeah, well, we do.
Her tone was more critical than concerned.
They have been getting into some trouble.
What else did she have to say?
She has to do Callie's progress reports for her P.O.
and she really thinks that Callie should be
getting more engaged in school.
OK, should we be concerned that
she's spending so much time with Daphne and Kiara?
Why, 'cause they're juvenile delinquents?
Well, because she's not making friends at Anchor Beach,
but now that you mention it.
They're good girls.
Yeah, at heart, but they do have a history of drugs and gangs.
The rate of recidivism with girls like them...
Callie is a girl like them.
Need some help?
I think we're good, thanks.
Um, I took a picture of Kiara while I was at Girls United
and I guess it helped her find a foster family.
That's wonderful.
Yeah, so I was thinking
maybe I could do that for other kids that need foster homes.
Take pictures, I mean.
So I can talk to my P.O.,
and see if it would count towards my community service hours.
And maybe I could use the photo lab at school?
Great. I think that can be arranged.
Yeah, maybe you can ask some of your classmates for some help,
or make some new friends.
I was actually gonna have Daphne and Kiara help me out,
just for their hours, too.
OK, that makes sense, but Principal Sanchez would really
like to see you getting more involved in school.
Yeah, and we would, too.
I will try.
Well, she wants to do it at school.
That's a step in the right direction, right?
Yeah.
All right, let me guess.
Huge gambling debt. And if you don't get the money ASAP,
a bookie's gonna come break your legs.
Or you're a male prostitute on the run from your pimp.
You caught me.
No, I owe it to my dad, actually.
He was giving it to me for my piano lessons, and I quit going.
So you just pocketed it?
Well, I was saving it for Callie.
So you're willing to break bad for the girl.
You must be in love.
You know what? Forget I told you.
So what, she took the money and ran off with Wyatt?
No.
I used it for something else.
And now I have to pay my dad back before he finds out.
He's just been going through a lot of stuff lately,
and I just don't want to stress him out anymore.
You're a good man, Charlie Brown.
You're an ass.
Is that any way to talk to your wingman?
What are you doing?
I'm getting you laid, bro.
Best thing for a broken heart. Let's go.
I gotta go.
Don't be a wuss.
No, I gotta go.
I missed breakfast?
You had to work.
All right, when I go back to my regular schedule,
it's me, you and pancakes every morning,
just like Mom's.
Or you know, cereal. But together.
Uh, so you know that dinner with Dani tonight?
It's been moved.
Yeah, to Mom's house.
Apparently, someone told her I had a girlfriend.
Right, I'm sorry.
So, um...
...how long has Dani been sober?
Five years. Why?
Are you...
I mean,
do you worry about dating another alcoholic?
I mean, like, if she were to start drinking again,
would that maybe make you wanna...
Brandon, I appreciate the concern.
But she's a rock, OK?
Look, I know I've given you reason to worry in the past,
but my sobriety is not tied into anyone else's.
OK?
OK.
I'm in a good place.
All right.
Oh, I called your piano teacher.
When?
Last week.
And when he calls me back, I'm gonna tell him to save you a spot.
The spot's long gone. He has a waiting list.
So I sweet-talked him once, who's to say I can't do it again?
I just don't want to take from him, OK?
I'm still playing piano, so...
He was kind of a pompous ass anyway.
So just don't call him.
Again.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
OK.
All right.
How is it possible you got scrawnier, Foster?
You get dumber every day, so...
Torched!
Jesus, you're up.
Oh, down a class.
Looks like someone's getting himself off the bench.
Never doubted it for a moment.
Thanks for your support.
Emma, you're up.
Whoa, would you look at that? I take it back, Foster.
Emma gained. Now you're in the same class.
Looks like we're gonna have a wrestle-off this afternoon.
Torched!
Vico, step up to the plate.
I was just on my way to see you with a gift.
Actually, more of a bribe, truth be told.
OK, what exactly are you hoping to get in exchange
for this delectable baked good?
I was wondering if it's possible that I take some of the props
from the drama club this weekend to the nursing home with me.
The nursing home? Are you moving in?
No.
I direct the residents in productions of Shakespeare.
This weekend's our performance.
Well, of course. Take whatever you need.
How did I not know this,
that you're doing Shakespeare in a nursing home?
I don't know. I've been doing it a long time,
so I never thought to mention it, I guess.
That's amazing, Timothy.
I'm very impressed.
Well, you needn't be, but thank you.
And the Sunshine Valley Home for the Aged production of Coriolanus
thanks you as well.
She didn't "Like" my pic, so I was all,
"Wish yourself a happy birthday."
Ugh, just unfollow her already.
I know, but then it's weird
'cause it's like when does she notice, and when she does,
does she think it's an accident?
Hi.
Hey.
Hey. I'm Callie.
We know. We're friends with Talya.
This place is so high school.
I know. I feel like everybody's talking about me.
Who cares?
Everyone thinks that I stole Brandon from Talya.
Well, you kind of did steal Brandon from Talya.
Right, and you kind of did put your underwear in Chase's pocket.
Anyway, I know it's embarrassing,
but in the scheme of things to worry about,
what these people think of you, it's not one of them.
You're right.
What's going on here?
Mariana, will you please open your eyes?
No. Because if I do,
then I have to acknowledge that this is actually happening.
Look, honey, we just want to talk to you about...
...the right ways to let a boy that you like him.
Oh, my God, please don't do this.
Sorry, but this is important, Mariana.
All right? We don't want anyone to get the wrong impression.
You don't... That's what it was, the wrong impression?
Yes, nothing happened.
OK.
Mariana, where did you even get such a crazy idea?
Talya. She used it on... never mind.
Yes, please, stop there.
Look, I just...
...no one would believe that a boy like Chase would like me.
I just... I wanted to prove them wrong.
Mariana.
Honey,
trust me one day soon, much too soon for us,
the right boy is gonna want to be with you.
Yeah, that's what everybody old says.
Yes, and you should listen to them because they are wise,
and by the way, not that old.
Beat it.
Whatever happened to do you like me, circle yes or no?
By the way, I invited Brandon and Mike over for dinner tonight.
What? You did?
Yeah, and Mike's new girlfriend. I told you this yesterday.
No, honey, just because you think something,
doesn't mean you ever said it out loud.
OK, then I'm telling you now.
I've invited Brandon and Mike
and Mike's new girlfriend over for dinner.
You said that we should met her.
I agree.
I think that's great, but I invited Timothy over for dinner.
Timothy? Well, then you can reschedule.
Come on.
Why should I reschedule?
Because we know that Timothy is not going to turn out
to be a 20-year-old hussy
who might someday be our son's stepmother.
It's too late. It'd be rude.
Well, fine. Then we're having a dinner party. Whoo!
Let's break out the hummus.
Graffiti is a crime, you know?
Ha-ha. No, it's, um...
This is you taking the photos?
That's pretty awesome.
Yeah, um...
Michelle is bringing some of kids from Girls United.
She's put the word out to other homes, as well, so hopefully,
it'll be a good turnout.
I wanna help them.
And I have to for community service, so...
They're just letting you use the school?
Yeah.
Lena's gonna come and get me and lock up after.
Cool. You're a really good person.
Two men enter, one man leaves!
Two men enter, one man leaves!
Two men enter, one man leaves! Whoo!
Shake hands.
Guess you shouldn't have eaten all those scones.
Congrats, Emma.
Hey, Foster, the bench isn't gonna warm itself.
Nice move. You deserve it.
Why are you mad? You won.
It's how I won. You saw me as a girl.
You think I let you win because you're a girl?
No, I think I won because it got weird.
It wasn't just me.
I have busted my ass, worked a hundred times harder
than any of you guys to be on this team.
I know you have.
On that mat, I'm not a girl.
Fine, you're not a girl.
God, you made me mad.
Damn, y'all. This school is fancy.
Right? Yeah, it's way nicer than the ones
Jude and I grew up going to.
Hey, how's Daphne doing?
It's rough. I'm worried about her.
Yeah, me, too. Does Rita know?
They check in on her, but you see that brave face she puts on
like she don't need no help.
She's gonna go back to the gang
if she doesn't get Tasha back.
I hear you.
You think she's gonna show?
I hope so.
Hi. I was going to bring dessert
but I'm a terrible cook, so...
I doubt you're terrible at anything.
But thank you so much. It was so, so kind of you.
Stef, this is my brilliant coworker Timothy.
Yes, we've met before, honey.
Hi, Stef.
Hi, how are you?
Good too see you.
Thank you.
Hi, come on in. You must be Dani.
You must be Stef. Thanks so much for having us over.
I've heard so much about all of you.
I wish we could say the same...
You promised.
Well, why don't out of the doorway, shall we? Dinner's ready.
Yes, come on. Come sit down.
Mike and Dani, why don't you come sit over here next to me?
Don't you wanna sit next to your wife?
I eat dinner with her every night.
No, actually, Stef, I thought you could sit over here
next to Timothy.
Uh... I thought Brandon could sit there.
No, no, Brandon could just sit right here.
Why don't I just move down one, and then Brandon could...
No, you're a guest, you can sit wherever you like. Stef, just...
Right here. Right there.
演唱者 Hey Ocean!
Beautiful! Oh, so cute!
Yeah, back to back. Like it.
Your models are here.
No way!
Hey, you!
Oh, my gosh, hi.
Aww, hey, honey. Oh!
I love that you're doing this.
And I heard back from some people,
and we should have kids from at least two other homes.
Oh, uh, this is my roommate, Monica.
This is the one I told you about. The notorious sandwich thief.
Seriously. Don't listen to him.
Really. If he gets on your nerves,
just tell him to listen to The Smiths. Works every time.
Yeah, whatever.
Quit it you two.
Let the new girl get her picture taken.
Sign-in is over here.
His parents won't take him back.
So he's looking for a foster home.
One that'll take in a transgender kid?
You best take some good pictures.
Took you long enough. You were supposed to help us set up.
You know how many buses I had to take to get here?
You put your cornrows back in.
Yeah.
So did you hear about the job?
Didn't get it.
You'll get the next one.
I didn't know they had schools on the beach.
This is like one of them resorts in Mexico.
What, they give you a penny colada with your homework?
Come on, let's get started.
Yes, I love that.
OK, and just, um, look over here. Yeah.
Do you see that boy over there?
That's actually my little brother.
Hey, Jude. Come meet a friend of mine.
Perfect! Thanks for the assist.
I'm here for you, but I think someone oughta take your picture.
No. Jude, stop it.
I'm serious. Stop it.
Daphne, save me.
No, no, no, no.
I am no one's human shield, girl.
Where's the girls room?
It's down the hall and to the left.
Wait. Just in case it's locked.
Out. Go!
This looks amazing.
Thank you.
Hey, bud. Where you been?
Sorry, studying. Lost track of time.
No doubt grappling with
the motifs of guilt and deception in Hamlet.
Timothy was a Rhodes Scholar.
Well, that's impressive.
It's really not a big deal.
No, it's a huge deal.
It recognizes academic achievement and character
and leadership ability.
Or in my case,
an ability to write an essay that swindled
a committee to believe I had all that.
None for me, thanks.
I'm sober.
Oh, you're in the program, too?
Five years. That's actually how I met Mike.
They're sober buddies.
Are sober buddies allowed to date each other?
Yes, if they're consenting adults.
You know, Bill Clinton was a Rhodes Scholar, as well,
I believe, wasn't he?
Uh, yeah.
So what do you do, Dani?
I'm a dog walker.
A business owner actually.
She has five employees and what, over 100 clients?
Timothy is an animal lover.
Big time.
Maybe I should date Timothy.
What is going on in there?
I'm trying to figure out
if that woman is a good influence on our son
and all you're talking about is Timothy.
All right. I have been thinking
maybe we shouldn't go with an anonymous sperm donor.
Maybe we should ask Timothy.
OK, maybe you should ask me first.
I wanted you to get to know Timothy better without the pressure
of, you know, thinking of him like that.
Well, if you had talked to me first,
then maybe I could have saved you the trip
to awesometimothyfacts.com,
because I'm not comfortable with
you seeing our child's father every day at work.
Like you and Mike?
Come on, that's different.
Lena, the...
Think about how challenging everything has been so far.
Do you really wanna open the door to
someone else's involvement in our lives?
The baby's life?
If it means knowing our child's history,
yeah, maybe.
Hi. Just checking. Can I help with anything?
Excuse me. I'm gonna hit the head.
So, I understand
you're a little concerned about my sobriety.
No, I...
Look, you're worried about your dad.
If I fall off the wagon, he'll fall off the wagon.
Which leads me to believe someone saw me out last night.
I know I saw you.
It was a one-time thing.
I understand. It was for me, too.
I slipped up. It won't ever happen again.
Are you going to tell him?
Your dad has had a rough time lately.
He doesn't need any bad news.
So I don't see any reason
to tell him about any of this.
Right?
Hi, thanks for dinner last night.
I am so sorry about that. Oh, my God.
About what? Saying amazing things about me?
No apology necessary.
I just really wanted Stef to know how much I respect you
and how much I cherish our friendship.
Well, thank you.
And if you're interested in using me as...
...you know...
...A sperm donor...
I'm in. If you want.
Excuse me. I need to speak with you.
"In his role as the Gentleman Caller, Chase Dillon
has all the charm and skill of a hat rack.
Though perhaps that is an insult to hat racks,
which at the very least, have purpose.
His performance is an insult
to the entire concept of live theater itself.
Also he abuses kittens."
Wow. Honestly, that was much nicer than I would have been.
How did you do this?
Doesn't the paper have to be approved by, like, a teacher?
Well, I might do the paper's layout,
and I might have made a tweak or two
after our faculty advisor gave final approval.
What Chase did to you was a total douche move.
There's no way I was gonna let him get away with it.
Why? 'Cause I'm your friend?
No, because I was righting a wrong.
Sorry, don't believe you.
I'm like Batman.
We're totally friends.
All right, fine, we're friends,
quit rubbing it in.
Someone got into the administrative office last night,
and a number of Kindle Paperwhite e-readers are now missing.
Do you know anything about that?
Well, it wasn't...
We know it wasn't you, honey.
During your photo shoot,
you didn't give my keys to anyone, did you?
No.
I gave you the keys to go to the bathroom.
I know your life's not easy right now.
So it's gotta be me, right? Something goes missing,
it's gotta be the poor girl with the cornrows?
That's not fair.
You called me out here,
made me take three buses across town,
just so you can accuse me of stealing?
They're making me give them a list of everyone who was there.
I didn't take nothing.
But FYI, you know who you can put on that list?
Your boy Brandon.
No, he wasn't there.
He was he was at my house having dinner.
Well, I saw him lurking around in the halls.
So unless he can be in two places at once...
Why didn't you tell me last night if he was there?
He's your temptation.
And we're supposed to have each other's back, remember?
You didn't come by school
during the photo shoot last night, did you,
to say hi or something?
No, I was at the house having dinner.
Why?
It's stupid, um,
Daphne said she saw you.
What's wrong?
Some stuff was stolen from the office.
Pretty sure Daphne did it.
I gotta go.
OK.
Um... two things.
First, I know how hard you've worked to be on this team.
So if I offended you yesterday, I apologize.
OK, accepted.
What's the second thing?
What about Lexi?
I don't know.
She's in Honduras.
Who knows when I'll see her again?
Right.
But I don't do cheating.
I know. Me neither.
I think I have to break up with her.
Your cut.
When you were in the office last night making the IDs,
did you steal some stuff, too?
So what?
Moron.
Now they know someone was in there.
But they don't know it was us, do they?
No.
So what's the problem?
Someone's gonna go down for this!
That's a good thing.
OK, whatever you took, put it back.
OK, this was not part of the deal.
All right, Nancy, relax.
I can't just walk in and hand it to them
Just put it back or they'll find it.
Anonymously. And don't take anything else.
No... I'll come back.
No, that's fine. What's up?
So last night, um...
...I just remembered
I gave Daphne the keys.
Thank you for telling us.
Independent living is
a lot harder than she thought it was gonna be so...
What do you think?
I like the ones where they're not looking at the camera.
Yeah, me, too.
I wanna see those.
No, no, no... wait.
What are you doing?
I have to zoom in.
What's that?
Let me brighten it.
It's Brandon's car.
He was there last night.
