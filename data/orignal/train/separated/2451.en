Who are you?
Who are you?
Oh, you made it!
There, stop.
Oh, my god. That's my mother.
This merge happened with my brother Luke,
and I won, so when I absorbed Luke's magic,
I must have gotten some of his qualities like empathy.
I think we both know I never really hated you.
I kissed Stefan. I want to talk to him about it,
but if it's bad, I feel like he won't be honest.
We'll talk when all of this is over.
We are here today to pay our respect
to Sheriff Elizabeth Forbes.
You're talking about flipping the humanity switch.
I just need the pain to be gone.
If Stefan had said the right thing earlier,
would that have changed your mind?
My mom is dead, Elena.
I'm not gonna let you do this.
That's not your choice to make.
Hello!
I'm empty.
Fill, please.
I think you've had enough.
Look at my face.
This is me straining
to care less about what you think.
Nope. I can't.
Ok. I'm gonna call you a cab.
Here's the thing. My mom just died
as in I just put her dead, cancer-riddled body into the ground
4 hours and 32 minutes ago.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Oh, no, no, no. I don't care about that.
I'm just saying that my feet
have been crammed in the world's most uncomfortable heels
for an entire day,
and your tequila is the only thing that seems to be helping.
Ok.
I'll grab you another drink.
Thank you.
Caroline Forbes, the girl from the swimming hole.
Liam. Ha. The boy I totally forgot existed.
And I was just about to tell you how sexy you looked.
You are drunk.
Slightly buzzed.
Getting my ass whupped in shuffleboard upstairs.
Oh, lucky you. I stood all day at my mom's funeral.
God, you're cute. Are you a doctor yet?
Hang on. Your mom just died?
Do you want to get out of here?
I...
What? Girlfriend?
We all know you're not dating Elena Gilbert.
Why would I be dating Elena?
You wouldn't,
but even if you were,
it wouldn't matter
because nothing matters,
not...a...thing.
Caroline! What...
It's like she never lived here.
How's her house?
Totally empty. Caroline took everything
but the damn doors off the hinges.
So what? She just flipped her humanity switch,
came back to the dorm,
and took all of her clothes
and thank you notes
and just left town?
I mean, that makes no sense.
This coming from the girl who burned her house down.
Do you think she's trying to cut off all ties to her past?
I certainly don't think she's having a yard sale, Elena.
Ok. Why are you getting mad at me?
I'm not the one who did this.
I know. I'm sorry.
Ok. Look. I'm just gonna look around campus,
maybe someone's seen her.
Just let me know if you find anything, ok?
All right. I will.
Looks like you could use a friend.
Oh, my God.
Bonnie?
H-how are you--
Alive?
I think I'd be used to this part by now.
I can't believe Bonnie made it out.
Actually, I can.
She's plucky.
Do you need help?
Before you answer that,
I'd rather not.
I just keep experiencing these pangs of guilt watching you.
Feelings are hard.
So's the end of this crowbar.
I'm just saying.
Digging up mommy's grave?
That's dark, even for me,
and totally unnecessary.
Damon, Bonnie saw her alive in a 1903 prison world.
It's--it's on camera.
You want to watch it again?
My mother died of consumption in 1858.
We did not go through the trouble
of moving this thing to the family crypt
only to find out that she's not even in here.
Oh, so you just-- you just called me here
because you needed a friend?
No. You wanted to know if it was possible
for her to exist in another prison world.
To which I responded, "Yes,"
to which you responded with denial.
Whatever or whoever's on that tape, it's not her.
Then who is it?
I don't know. A ghost?
Maybe she has an evil Gemini twin.
Nice.
If my mother was imprisoned in 1903,
she'd be in her 70s.
Not if she were like you.
I know my mother.
She's not a vampire.
She is not in a prison world.
She died of consumption in 1858.
Uh, if you're so sure of that,
why haven't you opened the coffin yet?
Congratulations.
Everything you know about your mom is wrong.
In the future, focus on my left side.
It's far more attractive.
Oh, my God.
We've met before.
Yes. You saved my friend Matt
with your blood.
Oh, yes. Uh, Sarah, right?
Care to join me for a cup of tea?
My best angle's up close and personal.
Brave.
I like that.
My not flannel blouse,
my not flannel t-shirts, and--
I really missed my not flannel v-neck.
Suck it, 1994.
So I bought this bottle of champagne
the same day that Damon and I thought
we were gonna rescue you,
but obviously, we didn't,
so I couldn't drink it,
so this is to you.
You were stuck there all by yourself
while we were back here,
living our lives.
And this is the worst toast ever.
I'm back home.
That's all that matters.
Cheers.
Ok.
Can we talk about the fact that I drove
Jeremy away to art school?
So does that make you his muse?
Because eww.
Do me a favor. Don't tell him I'm back yet.
Wait. You--you haven't called him yet?
I just--I want to give him a chance at normalcy
before we just drag him back into all of this, you know?
Yeah. No. I-I do, too,
but, Bonnie, you should at least tell him that you're ok.
And I will. I'll tell him.
Coming back to life is complicated.
Trust me. I've done it before.
Besides, we have a roommate without her humanity
and in severe need of an intervention.
Caroline.
Um, you're here.
And you're perceptive.
Uh, what are you doing?
Starting over. New everything!
New sheets, new clothes.
I even got us a new blow-dryer.
Oh, my god! Bonnie's back.
I thought you were trapped in 1994.
I got out.
Uh, we--we've been worried about you, Care.
You mean, you were worried about those around me,
like if I killed them.
Ok. Funny story. You remember Liam?
Elena dated this premed hottie
but then realized she still had feelings for Damon,
so she compelled him to forget that they ever had a thing.
What did you do to Liam?
I ate him,
and he was delicious.
I mean, you know how cute guys just naturally taste better?
You killed Elena's ex?
Ok. Can I tell my story, please?
Remind me why we're glad she's back again.
Please tell me that Liam is not dead.
Fine. So I was feeding,
and then that little voice inside my head that tells me to stop,
he never piped up.
More, please.
Well, this is awkward.
God.
You got blood on my necklace!
Now I'm gonna have to clean it.
What are you doing to me?
Well, I was going to drain of your blood,
but now I'm not really in the mood to drag
your corpse through the woods,
definitely not in these heels.
I could throw you in a dumpster,
but then everyone's always being found in dumpsters,
and since I was the last person to be seen with you,
I'll be questioned by the police,
and what if one of them reminds me of my dead mother?
What are you talking about?
You, Liam, just got complicated.
So you didn't kill him because it would be inconvenient?
Elena, I shut off my humanity.
I didn't turn into an idiot.
The last thing I want to do is give you a reason to ruin my life.
It's so weird.
It's like she's Caroline,
but she's not.
Oh, Bonnie, how we all just missed your commentary.
Anyway, in return for my good behavior,
I want a year where I don't have to feel pain or grief or remorse.
You're not gonna lock me in a cell and dry me out,
and you're definitely not gonna try to trigger some latent emotion,
hoping to snap my humanity back on.
So all you want is for us to leave you alone,
and then you promise not to kill anyone?
That's all I want.
Now granted, if anyone tries anything to flip my switch back on--
and I mean anything--
I'll become your worst nightmare.
Great!
I'm gonna get a latte.
See you!
So St. Caroline keeps her halo even with no humanity.
Yeah, until she snaps and strangles somebody with it.
Well, even if she does...
could be good for her,
you know, to blow off some steam, thin the herd.
Getting awfully crowded around here.
Damon, if she kills somebody, I--
Not your fault, Stefan.
By the time you figured out how you felt about her,
it was too late.
She made her choice.
Just do me a favor. Check around Mystic Falls,
see if anybody's missing.
Will do, brother.
A little later.
Yeah.
Why tell your brother your mother's still alive?
No, but I get it.
Mom's in a prison world
and therefore an evil psychopath.
Don't want to ruin little bro's perfect mommy memory.
I'll tell him as soon as I know the truth.
The truth.
Which is why you're still here.
Your sister sent me and Elena back to 1994.
You can send me back to 1903.
Technically, yes, I am able to do that,
but I'll need the ascendant for the 1903 prison world.
As the newly elected president of the Gemini freaks,
I assume you know where to get it.
So get it.
It's my pleasure.
You want something.
Shocker.
All right.
Well, ever since you told me Bonnie was back,
I, uh, I can't stop thinking about her,
all right, what I did, how she is.
It's annoying really.
Look.
I need to see her.
I need to apologize,
and you're gonna make that happen.
So that's it? Enzo?
That's all I get?
A name is a very personal thing, Sarah.
See? Doesn't that feel good?
I have pictures of you,
your veins doing weird, nonhuman things.
They're all on this little card.
You went from cowering in a corner
to overt blackmail in the span of an hour.
Impressive.
I know want to know more about you.
Fair enough.
One...
I'm very fast.
Two, I'm very strong.
That was, like, 70 bucks.
3, I'm very rich.
Rich, strong, fast,
you have weird veins,
you can heal people with your blood.
What are you?
This is a joke, right?
Does it look like I'm joking?
You want to hear me say it. Fine.
I'm a vampire.
And?
Perhaps you didn't hear me.
I said I'm a vampire.
You know, Anne Rice, Dracula,
that dreadful "Twilight" series.
No. I know what they are.
I just thought there'd be more to it.
It's ok. The whole vampire thing is over anyway.
Caroline.
Who is this nice girl we're divulging
all of our deepest, darkest secrets to?
I'm Sarah.
Sarah.
Photographer Sarah. Stefan's--
Darling...
You need a drink from the bar.
It is so nice not to care what you're up to with that poor girl.
Old me would have been in such a moral quandary right now.
Old you?
Oh, you didn't.
I did right after my mom's funeral.
Thanks for coming by the way.
Kidding!
I don't really care about that either.
You're a laugh riot, aren't you?
I'm actually a little bored,
which is why I'm recruiting cute boys
to come to Whitmore's warehouse party tonight.
You like to dance, right?
Yeah, I love it.
See you there.
Stefan. Hey, man.
I'm gonna ask you a couple questions,
and I need you to be completely honest with me.
I can be completely honest with you.
Good.
Do you remember being around Caroline last night?
Yeah.
Kind of hard to forget.
What is that supposed to mean?
We made out pretty hardcore.
Was there any biting involved?
I guess.
I mean, I-I like to bite the lower lip a little bit, but
I-I th--I think it's kind of weird you're asking me these questions.
No. I meant, did she bite you?
Not that I remember.
Are--are you into her or something?
Because, like, I thought she was single.
I didn't know you two were, like, a--
She is. We're not.
Great!
Can I get out of here, please,
because, like, I'm late for this party,
and you're really weirding me out.
What party?
Uh, warehouse party off campus.
Caroline will be there
if you want to watch.
Hey, Stefan.
Uh, listen.
I never thought I would ask this, but, um...
Do you want to go to a rave?
Ok. Not exactly the welcome home party
I was planning for you.
I think we should split up and look for Caroline.
Maybe we should split up and look for Caroline.
Good idea.
Good luck.
I'm fine.
Want to dance?
I'm actually looking for someone.
Come on. This is a party. Have fun!
Down, boy.
Just dancing.
Look. I really have to go find my friend.
I can't help it. You're hot.
What the hell did you do?
Can't help it. I'm hot.
Did he have any bite marks on him?
No, which means she must have given him her blood.
And he doesn't remember her feeding on him at all.
He remembers them making out in graphic detail,
but that's about it.
So that means she's covering her tracks.
It's very thorough. It's actually really good.
No, it's not good.
It means that she's gonna use him as a human blood bag
every time she gets hungry.
Or she'll drink from the blood bags in our fridge
that she just restocked.
Wait a minute. Why are you defending her?
I'm just saying she hasn't actually hurt anyone,
and there's no bodies that have shown up at the med center,
no students are missing.
What if she actually has this under control?
You know, we give her a year, she's happy, and then--
And then what? She magically flips on her humanity switch
and starts feeling everything that she's been putting off.
Caroline is going to snap,
and when it does, it's gonna be my fault
because I am the reason that she did this.
Pain is the reason that she did this.
Her mother died, her world was turning upside down.
She asked me one simple question.
All I had to do was tell her the truth,
and I didn't.
Now look me in the eye and tell me
that I couldn't have stopped this.
What's your plan?
Can't believe I'm about to say this,
but I'm glad you called.
Caroline go off the rails?
If so, I called it.
Gloating in one of my best friend's times of need?
It's weird that I miss you.
Bonnie, I thought I was clear.
Our relationship only exists within the confines of 1994.
You think one phone call makes us friends?
You don't have to pretend, Bon.
I'm like a fever you can't shake.
Yeah. Yeah. A disease.
You ok?
Well, if scorching some douchebag
with my magic is ok, then, yeah, peachy.
When you came back,
did you just slide right back into your old life?
Oh, you mean the one where my brother was an auto mechanic
and my girlfriend forgot she loved me?
Yep.
Why, um, why did you call me?
So...Teensy favor.
I don't know if you know this,
but when Kai merged with Luke,
he went through a metamorphosis.
He went from a sociopathic caterpillar
to a slightly less evil butterfly.
Yeah. And anyone who believes that is an idiot.
Please don't ever repeat that name to me again, ok?
Yeah. Ok. Heh. Already forgot about it.
What was the favor?
Don't worry about it.
I'll figure it out on my own.
Happy raving.
Who was that?
Bonnie.
She doesn't want to do it.
Doesn't believe there's a new you.
But there is a new me.
You--you explained it to her
so she would understand, right?
Small words, easy to digest.
Not gonna happen. End of story.
Shame...
Because mama Salvatore's story is pretty fantastic.
What are you talking about?
I have a strong lead on the ascendant.
I checked the gemini archives.
Lily was captured on a dock
in New York city in 1903.
What if she was on her way here for you?
I mean, it makes sense.
She--she'd just landed from Europe,
where...
Where what?
Spit it out.
Sorry.
You're not gonna tell me, are you?
No. Sorry. My throat just got really sore.
I'm gonna go find a lozenge.
Maybe Bonnie will change her mind
by the time I find one.
Well, that's certainly a look.
Don't be jealous.
You know, you should smile more.
You're hot.
Oh, thank you.
And obviously you're here to babysit me,
but I've had less attractive babysitters.
Granted, they were old women, and I was 8.
I'm not here to babysit you, Caroline.
Yes, you are.
You, Elena, Bonnie,
you don't think that I can live
a normal, humanityless vampire existence
without killing anyone,
and you feel guilty for being such a royal ass
at my mom's funeral.
You're right. I was,
and then when I came to apologize
and tell you how I really felt,
you were gone.
And now I don't care.
But I do,
so let me tell you how I really feel.
I said I don't care.
I like you, Caroline.
Stop.
I don't know when it became more than friendship,
but it did, and it scared me,
so I-I pushed it away,
but here we are.
See? That wasn't so hard, was it?
Only took a couple of years,
cancer to devour my mom,
me to flip my humanity off,
but you finally spit it out.
That's good. Anger.
That means you want to feel.
No, Stefan. You know what?
It just means that I'm pissed, so leave me alone.
Let it in.
It will hurt, and you'll want to die,
but I will be here.
I will help you through this,
but you have to give me a chance.
Please.
Come back.
You shouldn't have done that.
Where have you been?
The bathroom line was, like, a mile long.
I mean, look at all these crazy people here.
You are so boring.
No wonder Elena didn't pick you.
Honest truth. How good are you at surgery?
I'm a premed sophomore. I'm terrible.
Perfect! Come with me.
There you are. Finally!
Where's your date?
What, you don't want to show her off in front of Stefan?
I'm afraid she doesn't find me nearly as fascinating as I do.
But you have an accent.
Anything you say is automatically fascinating.
I'm afraid we found the exception.
Told her I was a vampire,
and her eyes glazed over literally.
Pure and utter disinterest.
What's funny?
Stefan's been looking out for Sarah
ever since she was a baby,
which means he will protect her at any cost.
Ok.
So what do you do when you want someone
to have nothing to do with vampires?
Compel them not to care about anything to do with vampires.
Caroline Forbes, you're a genius.
Thank you.
Now why don't I show you
some of my other talents?
Sorry, luv.
It's not as much fun when you're not really you.
What are you doing here?
Don't freak out, but--ahem.
Just get this over with.
Spit it out.
I wanted...
to apologize...
for anything I did...
that hurt you.
Bon?
Did you hear what I said?
If I see your face again,
I will melt it off.
I imagined that going a little differently.
Bonnie, hey. It's me.
Where'd you go? Call me.
It worked.
It worked?
You're Caroline's emotional trigger?
I saw it in her eyes. She's still in there.
We just have to go find her.
Wait. She's gone?
Stefan, she made it very clear
that if we mess with her she's gonna retaliate.
Then we find her, we lock her up,
and I push until I break through.
I can get her back, Elena.
Ok.
Ok. Let's go find her.
What, you really think I want to hear from you right now?
Is someone having a bad night?
What are you doing with Enzo's phone?
I stole it, but that's not the question
that you should be asking right now.
You should be asking "Why does Enzo have
Sarah Salvatore's number in his phone,"
or maybe "Where is Sarah Salvatore,"
and ultimately, "What the hell are you going to do to her, Caroline?"
Hello? Enzo?
Over here, luv.
Um, actually, I'm looking for--
Enzo. Yeah. I heard you.
He's not here right now, but I am.
Caroline, what the hell are you doing with Sarah?
There! An appropriate question.
Thank you for asking.
As a matter of fact,
I'm going to kill her.
Calm down.
It's just me. He's not here.
Bonnie, this is about my mom.
Kai knows a lot of stuff about my mom.
I don't care.
I told you I didn't want to see him again,
and you did it anyway.
I know, but, Bonnie--
Was I unclear?
He just wanted to talk.
Now I want to talk.
So listen.
I get that he hurt you.
I said listen!
I want you to feel what I felt.
You were there
the first time he hurt me,
an arrow through the stomach,
but you weren't there for what happened next,
when he chased me through the hospital,
when he strangled me,
he drugged me, he tied me up,
and he stuck me in a trunk,
and then suddenly, he wants to be nice, huh,
start over.
Bonnie.
Sound familiar?
He lied, and then he stabbed me again!
Then came the worst part
because when it was all over
he left me
alone...
And I wish I could share what that feels like,
but I can't.
I want you to get out.
Bonnie, I'm sorry.
Get out!
I'm making margaritas.
You want one?
Where's Sarah?
I see Stefan filled you in on his big secret.
Where is she, Caroline?
Not here. That would be stupid.
She's with Liam. Say hi!
Hello?
Sarah is helping Liam with his surgical skills.
Please! Please don't hurt me!
I don't want to do this!
Duh. You're probably gonna get expelled
and then found guilty of murder.
That's why I compelled you to do what I wanted.
No, please! Please!
Look, Caroline. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have pushed you.
Obviously.
I was pretty clear about that.
Look. I know that you can't feel it right now, Care,
but if you kill Sarah,
it's gonna haunt you forever.
Trust me. I did it, and it sucks.
I compelled a student to perform surgery on Stefan's niece,
and you found a way to make this about you?
God, you truly have a gift, Elena.
Look at me, Caroline. What do you want me to do?
You want me to leave town, I'll leave town.
I'll stay as far away from you as possible.
Just please let her go.
That's the problem, Stefan.
It doesn't really matter how far away you are.
You're still you--
kind, loyal,
who with one look can convince me that I'm not crazy.
That's the Stefan that I fell for,
and that's the Stefan who can bring me back.
Killing Sarah isn't gonna change that.
I know.
That's why I'd rather just change you.
Let go of that part of you, Stefan.
Caroline, what are you talking about?
If Stefan wants to save Sarah's life,
all he has to do is shut his humanity off.
Why are you both looking at me like that?
Do I need to repeat myself?
He is not turning his humanity off.
Elena, Stefan unleashed himself from you months ago.
He can think for himself now.
It's not gonna happen, Caroline.
Hey, Liam.
No! Please! No, no!
Cut out her spleen.
Caroline!
Relax.
She can live without a spleen.
You know, it's really the infection you should be worried about.
Please don't hurt me!
No! No! No!
I'm so sorry.
Hey, Liam. Remember that conversation we had earlier
about being honest?
Where are you?
Don't answer him, Liam.
Whitmore Medical.
Please don't hurt me! Aah!
Go! Get Sarah out of there.
Good luck getting there in time.
Please, Liam!
How's it going, Liam?
No, no!
I think I'm gonna go into pediatrics.
You know what? I changed my mind.
Leave the spleen.
Let's be a little bit more symbolic.
Please no!
Take out her heart.
Liam, you still with me?
I'm not in the mood for the preamble.
Just tell me why my mom's stuck in 1903.
You're not bringing your mom back.
That's odd.
Sounds like you just asked me to kill you.
You requested a truncated version,
so I respectfully jumped to the end.
And why aren't we bringing her back?
Because there are only two prison worlds in existence,
mine, created in 1994,
and the one created in 1903
for the sole purpose
of locking up your mom
and her closet full of crazy pants.
You said we'd get her back!
I'm telling you, as a semi-sane person,
you really don't want that.
And I'm telling you as a vampire who eats people
you really don't want to piss me off!
I'm trying to save your life.
Tell me how to get her back!
Your mom's a ripper, ok?
She's a ripper.
She turned in 1858,
faked her death,
went to Europe, where she
went a little nuts.
No.
Bodies piled up, she moved,
killed some more until she had to move again.
They think 3,000 in total.
That's enough.
And for some reason, my coven made it their duty to stop her,
so they cut her off at New York Harbor
before she could tear through Manhattan.
Granted--heh-- by the time they got the ship,
they found everybody dead.
It was so gruesome they had to burn it there at the harbor.
I said that's enough!
I guess I should show myself out.
It's Jeremy. Leave a message.
Hey, Jeremy. It's Bonnie.
It's a really long story, but I'm back.
Uh, I had this whole plan to drive out to New Mexico
and surprise you,
I don't know, show up as one of the models
in your drawing class or something.
Listen, Jer.
I'm not sure I'm still the same Bonnie you want to be with.
That place changed me, and I don't know
if I'm scared of myself or actually kind of like the new me.
If it's ok with you, I think I'm just gonna figure me out,
and then I promise to come visit you.
I hope you're well.
Ok. Bye, Jer.
No, please, Liam, no.
You're marking it worse.
You'll kill me!
You'll only make it worse.
I'll die!
Liam!
I never used one of these before.
I'm so sorry.
You don't realize it,
but this really does hurt me to watch.
I'm pathetic.
Liam, she stopped screaming. Is she--
I think she passed out.
Kill her.
Call me when it's done.
Stefan's phone.
Caroline, where are they?
You're gonna be a doctor, right?
How long can one live without their heart?
Maybe, like, 3 seconds tops?
She's gonna let her die, Elena.
I can't find them anywhere.
We're running out of time!
Bring me back.
What?
Stefan, w-what do you mean?
Bring you back from where?
Just remember to bring me back.
No. No. No, no, no, no.
Stefan! No! Stefan, no!
Stefan. No.
Oh, my god.
Elena, I'm so sorry. I don't know what I'm doing.
Just stop.
I have to take out her heart.
No. It's ok.
Everything's gonna be ok.
Hello.
Stefan, hey.
Thank god. I found her. I...
