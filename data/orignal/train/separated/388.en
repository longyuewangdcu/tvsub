The forecast,
plenty of sunshine through today with seasonal temperatures.
We should reach our normal high of about 82 degrees by this afternoon.
Look for clear skies tonight with a low near 70.
有2成的可能性有时有阵雨
Clurman!
Why didn't you return my calls, Gil?
Come on, Joe, give me a break.
I'm late for a meeting.
I left messages on every line.
I even talked with your assistant.
Look, I've been really busy, ok?
We have a meeting scheduled tomorrow.
We'll talk then.
That's right, we will.
You blow me off again it's gonna get ugly,
and I won't be so understanding next time.
Clurman's was the second bombing this morning,
both in residential neighborhoods in palm beach.
Homeland Security been notified?
[ATF: 美国烟酒 枪械和爆炸物管理局]
they want a threat assessment.
Is the media onto it?
Of course. JJ's keeping tabs on that.
What do we know about the bombs?
Morgan hooked up with ATF.
They're sending pictures of bomb fragments as they find them.
Pipe bombs.
Packed in cardboard boxes.
Package bombs
Sent through the mail?
No.
是ATF发现的开关
Same mechanism for both bombs, mercury-activated.
What does that mean?
There are contacts to a detonator
on either end of a bent tube full of mercury.
What it means is all you have to do is to tilt the package to detonate it.
So they couldn't have been sent through the mail.
The bomber had to deliver them himself.
Exactly. Strange way to commit an act of terrorism.
Why go to all this trouble to kill just a few people?
Let's recommend not raising the terror alert level for now.
No reason to spread panic.
We got news.
但现在已被到处播出
CNN, FOX, MSNBC, Al-jazeera, you name it.
So much for not spreading panic.
According to doctors, he's badly injured,
but in stable condition in the I.C.U.
他们大约10:30听到一声巨响
and police arrived...
恐怖袭击预警级别
they'll look weak.
Make sure Homeland Security knows that this is everywhere.
I just felt that!
Are you all right? Is everyone all right?
Let's meet at the airstrip in 20.
This is live, I repeat this is live.
Yeah, what's up?
Hotch, listen,
they're gonna be sending us bomb fragments by this afternoon.
I'm the only one with an ATF background.
So if you'd like me to stay behind and
supervise the bomb profile, I'm on that.
Morgan, you wouldn't be afraid to be out in the field
with a bomber, now, would you?
You know maybe it's not the bomber that I'm worried about.
I thought we were past all that.
曾让吉迪恩陷入创伤后的阴影
How do we know that won't happen again?
Morgan, I tell you what.
而不是在吉迪恩上
Copy that.

"almost all absurdity of conduct
arises from the imitation of
those whom we cannot resemble."
彼此相邻3英里的范围内
芭芭拉·凯勒
2 hours after that, Clurman got hit in his driveway,
and 45 minutes later...
well, we all saw that.
Jill Swenson, 34-year-old housewife
who lived across the street from Clurman.
Of the 3, only Clurman survived.
Was there any connection between the victims?
One. Clurman was a partner
in a $10-million condo development deal
in which Keller was an investor,
and a few weeks ago, the whole deal went bust.
Went bust how?
Geologists discovered that the land was on methane,
the condos never got built, the land became worthless,
and Clurman lost a lot of people and a lot of money.
So maybe one of them was mad enough to take aim at Clurman.
No, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
It's a little too early to theorize about motive.
Then where do we start?
From the beginning.
What do we know about bombers?
Mostly male, loners, history of criminal activity.
About 50% of all bombings are actually a product of vandalism.
一命呜呼
so the first suspects you always look for
in the bombing case are the victims.
Clurman was the only male.
Losing a large business deal like that
could be a powerful stressor.
Well, then there's the crime scene.
被炸的受害者
Why?
What was different about this one?
Before Clurman passed out,
all he told cops at the time was that
he saw the package sitting on the stoop outside his kitchen door.
Why didn't he take it in?
Why didn't it go off until he got to his car?
It's like 50 feet away.
Joe Reese, one of Clurman's investors,
was here before the bomb went off.
The cops have ruled him out as a s suspect,
but he said he saw Clurman get in the car with the package.
So maybe Clurman wasn't receiving a bomb at all.
Maybe he was on his way to delivering one.
But he drops it or tilts it,
and it goes off by accident.
I'd like to talk to Clurman.
In the meantime, let's get a warrant to search his house.
You have a package.
一路有警察护送过来
Ok, right on time
Thanks, man, I got this.
These are my bomb fragments.
We can start putting this bad boy together.
Why bother?
Don't you just look at the pieces for prints and stuff?
Garcia, what are you doing in the FBI?
I didn't get into medical school?
Why does that not surprise me?
Ouch. That's what my father said.
All right, I'm about to teach you something,
so pay attention.
Oh, it's like school.
不明嫌犯是怎么想的
You sound like Gideon.
Ok, ouch.
You think it's bull? Ok...
all right.
You see that section of pipe?
Yeah
That right there used to be part of the cap.
It screwed onto these threads right here.
But, see, here's the thing-
it had to be done very carefully
because even if one tiny grain of powder
go onto those threads while he was working,
that little bit of friction would have ignited the bomb.
Boom! Boom! Boom!
See you later, unsub.
Now, he didn't have to use a powder that fine.
He didn't have to use threaded caps,
如他不这样 会安全很多
But the bomb wouldn't have been nearly as deadly.
So what does that tell you about our unsub?
He's one sick puppy?
To say the least. One sick puppy that aims to kill.
Not scare, not vandalize,
or make some kind of political statement.
Kill.
Where's your team right now?
Down in the garage.
让他们再检查一下阁楼
是我 先生
Detective Morrison, palm beach P.D.
I'm lead on the case.
Nice to meet you.
This is agent Greenaway.
Agents Reid and Gideon are at the hospital.
I think you met agent Jareau at the station house.
Oh, yeah, she's taken over the place.
She does that.
ATF hasn't found any hard evidence yet,
录音机和电开关之类的东西
Yeah
It is amazing how many household items
count as potential bomb-making materials.
Hello?
Excuse me!
Mrs. Clurman.
What's going on here?
Mrs. Clurman
联邦调查局的
What are you doing in my house?
There's a copy of the warrant on the table.
I know that this is hard to believe,
but we just need to cover all of our bases.
We need to make sure that your husband was not involved in any way.
我丈夫正躺在医院里 腿被炸飞了
What are you talking about?!
Mrs. Clurman,
there are some questions that your husband needs to answer,
and the sooner that we talk to him and clear him,
then the sooner we can find whoever's responsible.
Agent Hotchner? We've got something.
We found this buried on the back of that shelf.
Mrs. Clurman...
Do you know anything about this?
What can you tell us about the package, Mr. Clurman?
I thought I knew what it was.
Pot for an orchid. I collect them.
I ordered the pot through the mail.
Why didn't you take it inside?
It was for my office.
I was going there anyway.
Thought I'd take it with me.
That's the last thing I remember.
You had an argument with Joe Reese. Do you remember that?
Joe was there?
He was angry,
he accused you of blowin' him off.
Any reason he'd want to hurt you?
Joe? No.
I mean, he's a confrontational guy,
but if he wanted to kill me, he'd just beat me to death.
A lot of people were angry about that deal falling apart,
and they were angry at you.
How did that make you feel?
I felt awful.
I thought those condos would make a lot of money
for a lot of people,
myself included.
I thought that geologist was legit.
He didn't even take samples.
He scammed us.
All those investors who lost their money...
Barbara.
Barbara Keller?
The first victim.
What about her?
It's just such a shame.
Such a nice lady, you know?
It was such an easy sale.
Sometimes I felt like I took advantage of her
because she was old and lonely.
Now she's dead.
Well... I feel terrible.
What is it?
Ah, my foot!
Get you something.
This isn't our guy.
回答问题依然清晰明了
He's got a sense of humor, displays empathy...
风马牛不相及了
This is nothing like a typical bomber profile.
What about the materials we found?
Well, we'll see if the fragments match at the bomb scene,
but I doubt they will.
Ok.
Look at this.
This is their nephew in Texas.
And according to Mrs. Clurman,
he was staying with them for a month and left last week.
有些复杂了
I'm not saying he's the unsub,
很可能会搞出点什么来
I'll call Morrison.
He'll contact local P.D. in Texas
and pick up the kid and talk to him.
它们也不会自己组装起来
I'm down to the last few pieces, and for the life of me,
或是否可以组装起来
They might not even be part of the bomb at all.
What's the big deal?
You got most of it.
I'd give you a B-plus.
Thanks.

I was serious. I really wanted to learn that time.

he always used something wood in his bombs.
I mean, I don't know.
These guys, they think they're artists or something,
so they sign their work.
And you think by putting these last pieces together,
you might find the signature?
Yeah.
See, sometimes the design itself is unique,
so once we do put it all together,
we can compare it to other exemplars in our evidence database
系我们的老对手制造的
What?
If there was another piece like this...
no, I tried that. It doesn't fit.
No, it could have been part of a longer rod
that fit through the top and went all the way through.
Tetris.
Damn it.
What? Did I mess something up?
No. No, no, Garcia.
You nailed it.
I know who built this bomb.
The guy's doing life in federal prison.
把这些发了过来
The three on the left are the bombs from yesterday.
The one on the right's from the evidence room at Quantico.
They are all identical.
They are made with steel reinforcement rods.
Adrian Bale.
Shrapnel Blast Kills Six
Who?
和我们的探员陷入僵持
就干掉了6名探员和1名人质
So you're thinking he's behind this?
Possibly, but he's in prison.
就像曼森[美国史上著名杀人魔]
It could just be a copycat.
There's one way to find out.
Let's put the screws to this guy.
No, no, no. Bale's too smart.
得小心应付
也要做好此路不通的准备
You're saying the connection to Bale doesn't help us at all?
No. I'm just saying let us handle Bale.
Look, we just heard from local Texas P.D.
You were right about Clurman's nephew.
He admitted the bomb stuff was his,
which is great for the Clurmans,
but it leaves us with zero suspects.
So what do you suggest my men do now?
Proceed from the profile.
I didn't know we had a profile.
We're dealing with a bomber.
We're talking about someone who's non-confrontational.
If you bumped into him in a cafe, he'd apologize.
Even if it wasn't his fault.
We would classify this bomber as highly organized,
based on the meticulous design of his bombs.
It means above average intelligence.
He probably has a skilled job, a trade,
one that allows him to work alone.
That's how he was able to make a sophisticated device
without raising suspicion.
Furniture maker, jeweler, et cetera.
Background in explosives?
No, not necessarily.
You're thinking about a type who likes to blow things up.
Gives them an emotional or sexual release.
Death's secondary.
Then what's this guy doing?
Murdering.
Bombs-just weapons.
And these attacks, they are not random.
Well, how do you know that?
The process of elimination.
We know bombers fall into a discreet number of
categories according to motive.
There's the terrorist whose aim is to spread fear.
比如地铁上
There's the politically motivated bomber.
来表明立场
like an abortion clinic.
Then there's our unsub.
他自己挑选受害者
specifically by placing the bombs at their stoops.
That tells us he has a direct motive.
是为了金钱利益或是掩盖罪行
And it tells us how we're going to find him-
through the people he killed.
Somewhere among the three victims there is a direct motive.
谢谢
Any questions, we'll be around.
You'll be around. I'll be in prison.
Somebody's got to talk to Bale.
Detective Morrison, how's it going?
We're combing through all the investors in the land deal,
got a couple of suspects who fit the profile.
We're going to talk to them.
Ok. Well, if you need anything, just let us know.
Right.
How we doing?
Frustrated.
I can't see why anyone would want to kill
a little old lady who collects cats and coins.
Unless somebody wanted the coins.
I spent a good chunk of my childhood
1944年版一便士
Yes, I was a little bit of a nerd.
Is that so surprising?
Not to me.
Morgan?
I just got the lab results from the powder residues on the bombs.
Ammonia nitrate, potassium chloride, and aluminum powder.
Nobody uses that mixture, Hotch.
Nobody but Bale.
That's right.
就觉得越相似
开关组合和螺纹规格也一样
It's weird, man.

That's the other reason I'm calling you.

I'm thinking our guy's doing the same.
确保民众知道这消息
Thanks, Morgan.
Excuse me.
Look, obviously Bale burned us pretty bad.
We just want to make sure if we're in a position
to make a deal with him that you guys are willing to do it.
Well, I think that's premature.
We're not even sure if Bale's involved yet.
What if he is?
You're sure you want to deal with a guy
who took out 6 of our agents?
Half of Florida is in a panic.
There might not be another choice.
There has to be.
[佐治亚州 亚特兰大]
Bale, you have a visitor.
you know why I'm here?
This guy in palm beach, right?
The palm beach bomber.
Somebody's got to give him a better name.
He uses your bombs, your designs.
Well, he should be careful.
Those things are dangerous.
Adrian...
you can't fool me.
If you're involved in this in any way and you do not help me,
I will make your life even worse than it is now.
Oh, but no, actually,
因为我以前就耍过你
And now there's another me out there, watching, waiting.
"棕榈滩炸弹客"的最新消息

we have reason to believe that the bomber may hand write
the delivery addresses on a plain white label.
Mommy, when's daddy coming home?

He'll be back tomorrow.
...Be examined carefully,
especially if you don't recognize the return address.
Have you unpacked your suitcase yet?
No. I'll go do it right now.
With your help,
we should be able to prevent any further casualties.
Thank you for your vigilance.
You were more ruthless than I expected.
If you hadn't pushed that button,
you might've had a chance at parole someday.
Yeah.
You know, I've thought a lot about that day,
and there's one thing I still can't understand.
You trusted me. Why?
I never trusted you.
You listened to me.
I made an error.
I calculated you wouldn't do it, and you did.
我能走出去但你永远也不行
Here's what I think.
Sending those agents into that warehouse,
it just doesn't make sense.
I mean, I've read your books.
I had all those things- what did you call it?
Um... a homicidal triad.
是典型的反社会分子
外加一名人质的时候
I mean, just because I gave myself up
doesn't mean that I was finished with those people.
I still had the remote. You...
you should've known that.
And the emotional release I would feel by pressing that button...
well, that was just a little too overwhelming to pass up.

Why didn't you do your job, agent Gideon?

What does it look like?
It's brown with blue letters.
Can I bring it to you?
No!

The first thing we gotta do is to get mother out of there.
OKay
You gotta it!
Just keep holding on, ok?
But it's heavy.
Oh, I know, I know,
but you're doing such a good job.
Ok, everything's gonna be ok.
No, nobody over there.
I don't want to scare the little girl.
Just a few more minutes.
Hear that? We're almost there.
It's heavy, I can't hold it.
Yes, you can.

She's on to him, he shuts her up.
Were these coins valuable enough to kill over?
She told the insurance company
she thought they might be worth $12,000.
All right. Do you have any idea who sold her the coins?
约了时间见面

A guy named david walker.
So maybe he can help us figure out who sold her the coins.
Office of Supreme Genius Puzzle Solver.
Do you have a riddle for me?
I found out Bale has been accessing the internet
by getting around a fire wall that's set up on a prison library computer.
The guy even has an e-mail address.
Wow. Sneaky bastard.
Yeah. He's headed for the library right now,
maybe to contact the unsub.
Is there a way to possibly monitor his keystrokes
while he's online?
I can send him a virus,
but he'll have to open the e-mail for it to work.
Let's do it.
What do you want in the subject line?
Let's think.
Something that'll make him open it.
Yeah. He's impotent.
Something that'll make him feel in control.
I got something.

Looks like some sort of site for bomb enthusiasts.

We need the names of everyone who's been on that message board

Through the ISPs, we were able to track down the names and
some of the addresses,

more boring than coins and old papers.

Yes.
I have a word of advice.
Don't marry the first guy that proposes.
I wanted a pool table back there,
but david insisted on making it his workshop.
Hey, Reid. Ok, shoot.
David...
Elle.
I got to call you back.
What's he up to now?
It sounds like a car.
I hope he's not committing suicide.
I won't be able to collect life insurance.
Yeah.
Elle, it's him. It's Walker.
Get out of the way!
You ok?
Yeah, I'm all right, but Mrs. Walker...
yeah. Guy's a real peach.
Morrison's got a county-wide search out for the car.
Uniforms are going to try to find out where his haunts are.

that this guy is smart, dangerous,
and has absolutely nothing to lose.

Why not? I haven't slept this week.
I might as well give up eating, too.
Oh, poor baby.
Try not to let the tears hit the paper.
Gets a little messy.
Hmm. Really.
These are emails from Bale's account.
Reid forwarded them to me.
What are we looking for?
Right now this guy Walker's in the wind,
so we gotta look at him from every angle,
see if we can figure out his next move.
Signature behavior.
If Walker got bomb-making tips from Bale,
then maybe he got tips on staying clear of the cops.
Ha! Somebody's been taking notes.
[美国人以押韵表自嘲或质疑]
Don't hurt yourself, Garcia.
Now find me something.
So far, nothing from the search.
What do we know about Walker?
He's a quiet career criminal.
Spent 4 years in prison
for a series of forged checks
when he was in his early 20s. He's now 46.
Past 18 years,
he owned a store which sold coins, maps,and historical documents.
We raided the place as soon as you gave us Walker's name.
Most of his inventory was fake,
forgeries valued in the millions.
But the walls had started to close in on him.
We talked to some of his clients,
and he was in debt up to his ears
and promising stuff he didn't have time to forge.
Then Barbara Keller found out that the coins he had sold her were fake.
She threatened to out him.
And if she had, all the
forgeries would have been discovered.
He would have done 20 years.
So he had to shut her up?
He planted all those bombs just to kill one little old lady?
故弄玄虚
You hear me? I said stop now!
Please... help me.
Everyone back-now. We need bomb squad in here.
Please... it's not me.
Don't come any closer.
Put your hands up and walk slowly back out.
I can'T. He'll kill me.
Who will?
I don't know.
He held a gun to me,
put this on me.
He said...
you'll know who he is.
What does he want?
A helicopter. And passport.
He's watching.
Once he gets what he wants,
he's got instructions to defuse the bomb.
Walker's close by.
Let's get snipers around the perimeter.
Get snipers on the roof.
Ok, we understand. We're not gonna leave you.
Please... take it off.
We need to figure out
how the bomb's put together first.
Tracy, you're in.
This is a really sophisticated device.
It looks like it was probably made by a master bomb maker,
which means tampering with any part of it could set it off.
Isn't there some way to just cut the whole thing off him?
Not without cutting these wires.
See how they're threaded all around the collar?
They could be booby trapped,
or there could be a hidden secondary trigger.
How do we find out?
Without knowing how it's put together, it's gonna take a while.
I'll have to x-ray it, try to figure out which are the real triggers,
but... I don't think there's enough time.
What do you mean?
There's a timer.
We've only got about 3 hours left.
What is it?
We need to go outside.
No!
He said he'd kill me if I went back out.
He made sure I told you that.
Then we need to isolate you.
Why?
There's nothing you can do?
Is there anything?
I don't get it.
If this guy's a hostage,
then why hasn't Walker tried to negotiate with us?
Maybe he's scared or maybe he hasn't
figured out what his next move is yet.
We got a bead on Walker. Sniper spotted him in his scope.
He's sitting in an office building across the street.
It looks like a storage room with a small window facing us.
We could surprise him.
Good idea. If he feels cornered, he might give himself up.
Why do you say that?
Because bombers are generally cowards.
I'll take a team in and we'll go in through
the back of the building.
This feels wrong to me.
Why would Walker let himself be found so easily?
He wants to be found.
Why?
To negotiate.
But then we lose the element of surprise.
Hopefully, we catch him off guard,
he may give himself up immediately.
If not, we take a hard line
and make him feel like he's got no way out.
Remember, we have to take him alive.
Walker's the only one who can defuse the necklace bomb.
Everybody ready?
Yes, sir. Let's do it.
We're entering the building.
Be careful. At the very least, we know he's got a gun.
Copy that.
We're approaching the door now.
Copy that.
So bombers are cowards, huh?
Yeah. Every last one of them.
David walker, federal agents.
Federal agents!
Walker, freeze!
Ok. Please don't shoot!
Show yourself!
I'll shoot up the whole room.
Ok...
All right, now put your hands up where I can see them
I can't do that.
Then I'll shoot.
My hand is on the remote.
I told you what I want.
The passport, the helicopter, the flight!
Walker, listen to me.
You're at the top of the FBI's most wanted list.
I think you're smart enough to realize
there's no way we're letting you go.
Here's my counter offer:
A chance to get out of here alive.
All you have to do is give yourself up.
Just slide the gun across the floor
you have until 3,1...
you wouldn't let the hostage die.
You wanna find out? Don't give yourself up. 2...
ok! Ok.
I'm coming out. Don't shoot.
Gideon. It's me.
I just found an email Bale sent Walker 2 weeks ago.
Listen to this,"my only regret is giving myself up."
And for what? To be stuck in a cage for the rest of my life.
"Don't make my mistake. If they catch you, whatever you do,
don't let them keep you. "
Now walk slowly towards me
Let me see your hands, Walker!
Walker's not a bomber.
He's a forger.
Get out of there now! Now!
Go, go, go, go! Everybody out!
We're fine. Everybody made it out. Everybody but Walker.
Is the hostage ok?
He's fine. For now.
How much time do we have?
2 hours,24 minutes.
With Walker dead, I'm all out of options.
I've got one.
Bale.
we'll start with a transfer.
You're in a high security facility now.
We can get you medium.
No. I want out of prison.
A mental facility.
You're asking for something we wouldn't give a bank robber.
There are minimum security prisons-
I don't care.
I want to be able to talk to people who aren't prisoners.
I want to have access...
to people, things, the world.
I want to connect again.
All right.
One more thing-
without which there is no deal.
What is it?
I want you to confess.
I want you to admit that I beat you in boston and
I outsmarted you.
I want you to apologize to
the families of those 6 victims you got killed.
And I want it all in writing.
This's enough.
If I do this, you'll tell me how to defuse the bomb?
Only... if you do this.
How do I know you won't lie to me?
It's all in writing, agent Gideon.
If my client refuses to give you the information
or if he gives you information
he knows to be untruthful, the deal is void.
I wanna hear it.
"It was a hostage situation-"
no. Don't read it. Say it.
It was a hostage situation.
I negotiated with Bale.
He agreed to give himself up.
He came out of the warehouse peacefully.
I gave the ok to send 6 of my agents in,
and they never came out.
It was a mistake.
It was my mistake. I was...
I was outfoxed by Mr. Bale.
By you.
I sincerely regret having made the decision
to send those agents in that day.
And I sincerely regret and apologize
to the families of all those who died that day.
4 more minutes.
Ok. I've isolated the wires connected to the actual device.
We've got one shot at this.
It's either the blue wire or the red wire.
Which do we cut, Bale?
Red or blue?
Red.
You know if you're lying,
this thing goes boom, you get nothing, right?
Yes.
If we cut the red, it's over.
You get to spend your time in a cushy asylum,
bushes, trees, visits, nurses...
and we get this man out of here alive.
I don't see how I could be any clearer.
17 seconds.
Red wire, right?
Yes.
Cut the blue.
Are you sure?
Do it.
All right. Shouldn't take long to cut this thing off now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
How'd you know?
And the emotional release I would feel by pressing that button...
well, that was just a little too...overwhelming to pass up.
He told me.
He said given the opportunity of pressing that button,
he'd have no choice.
All I did was take his word for it.
Despite the fact that you lied to us and your deal is void,
I made sure to tell all your friends here
how extremely willing you were to give up information
on your fellow inmates.
you're a rare bird.
I can't tell you how much pleasure I get just knowing
I put you in this tiny cage.
You might even call it an emotional release.
