Tess, there is such a thing as right and wrong.
You're married.
What if I wasn't?
What you're doing, it only ends one way.
I wasn't the only senior partner who voted for Hardman.
And I don't see you giving anyone else shit
the way you give me.
And by the way, when the chips were down,
I backed you, I ousted him.
Tell yourself whatever you want, Louis.
But tell it to yourself.
I can't go away with you, Harvey.
Why not?
The next time I have an option
to cross a line to save you,
I'll send you packing and not think twice.
Now get your shit together.
You need to go,
and I need to get my shit together.
How nice, greeting me at the door.
When do you think are they gonna take that down?
Pearson... just doesn't have the same ring.
Pearson Paulsen sounds pretty good.
Okay. No, it doesn't.
How's my day?
How was your night?
And by night, I mean weekend,
and by weekend, I mean Zoe.
It was fine.
That's it?
No fun banter?
No witty repartee?
And you're in the office at exactly 8:00.
Not early, which would mean it went badly.
And not late, which would mean it went great.
But exactly on time, which means--
You and Zoe never went away for the weekend.
What happened? Do you want to talk about it?
I have ice cream.
It's 8:00 A.M.
Which is why god made chunky monkey.
It has chocolate and bananas.
Bananas are part of a healthy breakfast.
And who cares about the bananas?
It has chocolate.
Okay, you caught me. I don't even eat the bananas.
8:00 A.M. means the business day has already started.
I'd like to conduct some business.
Well, in that case,
Trent Devon would like to see you.
So schedule an appointment.
Okay, you have an 8:02 with Trent Devon.
Well, I didn't meet you at the elevator
just to chat about your weekend.
Fine. Get Mike.
From home?
You gotta be kidding me.
My client is here, and my associate is not?
Well, I'm sure--
Donna, I don't want to hear it.
The minute Mike Ross sets foot in this building,
I want to know.
I think it's a bad idea, Harvey.
We'll double the share price
by the end of the first quarter.
That's not what I meant.
I'm just-- I'm not sure going public
is the best move right now.
That's why I'm here.
Trust me, these aren't valid reservations.
You're just getting cold feet.
Harvey.
I'll have Donna send you some fuzzy slippers.
You'll be just fine.
Are fuzzy slippers gonna stop
the title 16 ruling that came down Friday?
You don't even know what that is, do you?
No, I don't.
But what I do know is it's not gonna change
the value of your site.
You've tripled your reach in the past ten months.
Everyone is talking about you.
Now is the time.
Come on, we agreed on this.
What's this really about?
It's about the changes around here.
Nothing's changed.
I'm here.
Harvey.
I may be a tech head, but I'm not oblivious.
This firm just went through a battle, and I know it.
Are you telling me that you don't trust me
to put your needs above the firm's?
No, I've always trusted you, Harvey.
I'm just saying I don't--
I think you might be too distracted
to give me the best advice.
Trent.
I have to consider my options.
About the IPO or Pearson Hardman?
Both.
We have a problem.
Yeah?
Bernie Carillo is thinking of leaving us.
That's absolutely not true, and I would know.
I have it on good authority.
So let me guess. It's my fault.
Louis, I didn't come here to blame you.
I came here to give you a heads up.
You want to spit out what you're chewing on?
Yeah, you order me to rescind an offer
due to a firm-wide hiring freeze.
I stake my reputation on it.
Two minutes later, you hire a fifth-year.
You went back on your word.
And you made me look like a fool.
I also gave you my word that
there'd be no coming back from your vote.
And I'm ready to go back on that.
We're losing clients, Louis, and I can't have that.
So today is day one
of the Louis Litt rehabilitation program.
Take it. Move on.
It is time to heal the wounds.
I'll take care of Carillo.
Come on!
Out with it. What'd you do?
I think I put in too much toner.
With Carillo, you imbecile.
He's considering a change of counsel.
Now, I want to know what you did
or more likely did not do to cause this.
What?
I don't know.
What a shocker.
If you want, I can go back, and I'll retry--
No, no, no, no.
What I want is for you to finish
drafting the contracts
and deliver them to Rachel Zane
by 8.00 A.M. tomorrow morning.
Then wait for further instructions,
politely seated,
with your hands crossed on your lap.
And if anything goes wrong,
I swear to almighty god
that you are gonna rue the day
that you decided to become
the embarrassment of a lawyer that you are.
Louis Litt does not lose clients.
Is that clear?
About the Carillo contracts
or the fact that you don't lose clients?
Get out.
Oh, sorry.
Uh-oh. Wait a minute.
What is this?
Is that a triple nonfat sugar-free mocha latte?
Oh, you sweet, sweet--
Wait a minute. What did you do wrong?
Okay, I'm offended. You're questioning my motives?
Actually, Mike--
It's okay.
You haven't had your second triple latte yet.
I forgive you because I'm in a forgiving mood.
Right, but Harvey's...
I love the smell
of litigation in the morning.
Not.
It's 8:30.
Yeah, in the morning.
It's 30 minutes past
when you were required to be here,
which means it's an hour past
when you should be here.
Okay, since when do we use a time clock?
What are the new FTC title 16 requirements?
Oh, they're nothing. It's a nuisance.
Trent Devon's worried about them.
Okay, well, all it is is another form to fill out.
So if that's what you're worried about, it's fine.
What I'm worried about is the fact
that I could've told him that
had you been at the meeting
this morning at 8:00.
What? I checked the schedule.
There was nothing on it for this morning.
It happened spontaneously, as things do.
And I was there.
You were not there.
Did you not hear me
when I told you to get your shit together?
No, I did hear you, and I did
get my shit together, by the way.
That's why I'm late this morning.
Deciding to be late to get your shit together
is not getting your shit together.
Get it through your head.
We just went through a civil war,
and the world knows it.
We're weak.
And the law of the jungle says
the weak get eaten.
Okay, Harvey, I'm sorry,
but you need to ease up here.
Ease up?
You're telling me to ease up
when our clients are leaving?
That's right, Trent Devon might leave.
People don't leave me!
I-I--
enough!
Your job is to help me, not to screw me.
If I tell you you did that,
I don't want to hear that you didn't.
I should've fired you last week.
You know what, I should fire you right now.
But I cut you slack because your grandmother died.
Well, you've used up the rope.
You keep it up, I will fire you tomorrow.
"People don't leave me"?
Donna, I don't--
I do.
He deserved it.
He deserved a slap.
You knocked him across the room.
What happened with Zoe?
She's leaving New York
to take care of her niece whose father is dying.
Oh, my God.
Harvey, I'm sorry.
Is there anything...
No.
Just one thing.
I don't think kicking the dog is gonna help.
Wow, you look like hell.
Jimmy.
You here to pick a fight with me?
'Cause I'm really not in the mood.
No, no, Mike. It's not like that, man.
Oh, yeah? You're not still pissed at me?
You gave me an out.
I might not have respected it at the time,
but I do now.
As far as I'm concerned,
I owe you one.
Okay.
Yeah. Let me buy you a drink.
Two conditions.
One, you still owe me one.
Two, you still owe me one.
As long as I still don't owe you one.
Bartender.
It's good to see you, man.
You too, buddy. So what's going on?
You had a bad day?
Yeah.
Okay. So give it to me.
Well, evidently, getting in at 8:30 can only mean one thing.
Yeah, that you had your head up your ass from 7:00 to 8:15.
How'd you know?
Are you forgetting I used to work for Louis too?
And unlike you, I didn't have Harvey there to protect me.
No, this was Harvey.
Whoa. Ain't that some shit.
Anyway, here's to the wonderful world
of being an associate, right?
Yeah. Pearson Hardman.
What does that mean?
I'm at Bratton Gould, my man.
And I'm happy.
No!
Associates don't get to be happy, Jimmy.
No, you do at Bratton Gould.
I got an office.
Shoot me now.
That's great.
Listen, Mike.
When I said that I owe you one, I mean it.
'Cause you didn't hear it from me, but we're expanding.
So if you want to jump, just let me know.
I'll put in a word for you.
I can't leave Harvey.
Screw Harvey.
I mean, what's he done for you?
More than you know.
Okay, maybe.
But a year under Harvey Specter,
they would kill to have you.
And you wouldn't be the only one.
There are people from Pearson Hardman
going to Bratton Gould? Who?
I can't tell you that.
Jimmy, you have to tell me that.
Mike, come on. If they knew it came from me--
They won't.
I saw Clark and Owens meeting with our partners.
If you're here to give me your letter of resignation,
I'll accept it in the morning.
Oh, that's ironic. I was offered a job tonight.
Congratulations.
I passed.
You want credit for that?
No, I want to do the job I already have.
Apology accepted.
Bratton Gould is poaching our associates,
Clark, Owens, but he's also coming after--
Our clients. Trent Devon.
Someone's whispering in his ear.
Allison Holt.
She was brought in about a month ago.
She was ready to throw you under the bus.
And Jessica threw her out.
So you think she's in this for revenge?
Maybe.
But we both know who brought her in.
Hardman.
You think this is him?
Hell of a view.
Clark and Owens don't deserve this.
Which one is Owens, by the way, the redhead?
You don't even know who your associates are,
but you're here to complain about losing them?
You bitter because you were fired?
I'm not bitter, Harvey.
Unlike you, I don't take things personally.
And by the way, I was right.
I advised you to settle, and you settled.
Your advice was for us to settle,
and I lose my law license.
And my question is,
was taking that deal your idea or Daniel Hardman's?
You think Daniel's behind this?
You met with him six days ago.
I'm not even gonna ask how you know that.
I told you before, Jessica.
I'm a straight shooter.
Daniel wasn't dictating my actions then,
and he's not now.
Either way, we are filing a claim for tortious interference.
You're using privileged information to target our clients.
You really want to cry foul to the ref?
You know who went to the ref more than anyone?
Michael Jordan. He did it quietly.
And he got six rings,
and he's my client.
Maybe I should call him too.
You're not getting Trent Devon.
You can't keep people who want to leave, Harvey.
Everybody knows about your civil war.
Pearson Hardman is falling apart.
And I'm telling you,
the avalanche has already started.
The Carillo contracts, they should be signed
and on my desk.
I know.
Well, since you're so in the know,
perhaps you can tell me why I don't have them yet.
Because they're not signed.
Not signed?
I called earlier to have them messengered--
The story's already taking too long.
And they said they didn't need to see them.
Still waiting.
They said they're no longer a client.
Harold.
No. Harold didn't--
Louis, Harold didn't do anything.
Harold never does anything.
He got me the contracts first thing this morning.
He worked all night. They were really quite--
Excuse me. They were really quite--
"Quite" what?
Good, actually.
Uh-huh. And how many citations you correct?
None.
You're lying.
No, I'm not.
I don't care.
Wow. Yeah. That is a tattoo.
It's cool, right?
Yeah.
Manatee--the slow, gentle cow of the sea.
Uh, no. It's a shark actually.
Totally. No--yes.
That's a shark.
That is a big, wide, fat shark.
You're fired.
You can't fire Mike.
You.
You moron. You can't even get your firing right.
I'm fired?
Louis, come on.
Pack up your things and go. Now.
But I did everything you asked.
I delivered the Carillo contracts.
I don't care.
The client fired us, and now I'm firing you.
Times are tough, people.
We can't afford mistakes. We can't afford incompetence.
You can't cut it, get out.
There is no place for mediocrity here at Pearson Hardman,
And there's certainly no place for someone like you.
Everyone else get back to work.
You know. I didn't just do what he asked for Carillo.
I went way beyond.
I didn't make any mistakes,
and I know that they're not leaving because of me.
So why didn't you say that to him?
Because he makes me freeze.
You know, sometimes I wish
we would've known each other at Harvard.
Yeah. Yeah. Harvard.
You probably hung out with Duncan and those guys.
I hung out with the library.
I'm such a loser.
No, you're not, Harold.
Look, for the record, Duncan was a douche.
He was a douche.
Totally.
Like a douchy-douche.
Do you remember that thing he used to do with the--
I know.
You know what I mean?
See, that's what I mean.
If you would've known me there,
then at least someone here would know that
I wasn't always like this.
People used to come to me for help on their essays.
We'd sit in the quiet of my apartment
where no one was yelling at me,
and I could think and write.
Really?
Yeah.
Here.
This is the first essay I wrote in law school.
Look at the professor's comments.
Holy shit.
Louis is right. I don't belong here.
No, he's not.
Thomas.
Poconos weekend.
With the girlfriend.
Which one?
Doesn't matter.
Done. Winters?
Lunch with the mayor.
Campos.
Lunch with me.
Lunch with me.
Benson?
Box at the garden.
Have Lundqvist meet him pre-game.
Does the king do that?
He does for me. Siebertz.
Tickets.
Super bowl.
Broadway.
Really?
Beneath that lumberjack chest
beats the heart of a songbird.
Fine. Anything but Cats.
Cats closed over a decade ago.
What took 'em so long?
That's it then. We're done.
Closed them all.
That's just foreplay. We didn't close shit.
I want to have talked to every one of my clients
by the end of the day.
You stay on Trent Devon until he takes the call.
I will.
And, Harvey...
No one is leaving you.
Okay.
Harold is totally freaked out.
I think he's gonna have an ulcer,
but the good news is he'll never disappoint you again,
so you can go and magnanimously hire him back now.
Why would I do that?
Um, I don't know, because you made your point.
You think that was a show?
Look, I know Harold can be...
Harold.
He's an idiot savant minus the savant.
He tries hard. He's a good person.
Yeah, well, then tell him to join the peace corps.
Why don't you just give him a second chance?
I did, Mike. It was called his second day.
You realize you need cause, right?
You want a cause?
He left a zero off the Hopkins settlement,
which cost the client $360,000.
He filed a motion with the appeals court
instead of the superior court,
which accidentally triggered a death penalty review.
And then the one and only time
that I take him to court with me, his fly was down,
and he called the judge "Your owner."
You know why he does those things, right?
Because you intimidate him.
You brutalize him.
You're always talking about how great you are at grooming us.
Well, you were not great at grooming him.
If he can't take a drill sergeant yelling at him,
how can he handle people shooting at him?
People don't shoot at us, Louis.
Don't they?
Okay. You know what?
You want him to stay...
Fine. He can stay.
Thank you.
One condition.
You personally guarantee
every piece of work product
that Harold sends out of this office
just like I have.
You check everything he does.
You cross every "t," dot every "i,"
and still do everything you have to for Harvey.
People may not be shooting at us, but we are at war.
So how does that work for you?
Do we have a deal?
Harold.
I was just coming by to wish you well.
Thanks, Rachel, but I think it's gonna be okay.
Mike's talking to Louis right now.
Really?
That's great.
Well?
There was nothing I could do.
It's okay. I know you tried, Mike.
If it'll make you feel better,
you're not the only person being let go this week.
Well, Clark and Owens are only getting let go
because someone found out that they're moving
to Bratton Gould with Mckinney and Kline.
They are?
Yeah, I overheard it.
I guess some people will choose any port in a storm.
Harold, good luck.
You too.
This sucks.
It does.
He didn't deserve that.
Allison's not done.
We know. We're working all the clients.
No, it's more than that. She's taking Mckinney and Kline.
It's just two more associates.
No, it's more than that.
I tell you the rats are jumping ship,
and you say it's fine, but Donna nods,
and you're busting out life jackets?
You have a history of panicking.
He's not panicking.
Clark, Owens, Mckinney, Kline--
These aren't just associates.
They're the best fifth-years.
They're Louis's first class of associates.
He gave her a report card?
Harvey, you do not know that.
Well, I'm gonna goddamn find out.
Stop.
Just cut it out.
All right, I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
I never liked you, Louis.
You're a vindictive, sniveling rat,
but I never thought you'd betray your own firm.
I never betrayed this firm.
What do you call helping Allison Holt
poach our associates?
I had nothing to do with that.
I love this firm, Harvey.
You were a traitor when you voted for Hardman,
And you're a traitor now.
Like I've told you before,
I'm not the only one in this firm who voted for Hardman.
And I voted to oust him once I knew.
Once you knew you had to save your own ass.
All right, you know what, Harvey, just get out.
Get out.
Ri-- I did nothing wrong.
Jesus!
You bugged my office.
You ran to Hardman about the CM lawsuit.
You sold your soul for senior partnership.
And once you got it, you created a drug policy
with the sole purpose of firing me!
I did it for Hardman.
Maybe Hardman wanted me dead,
but you're the one who went out, got the gun,
aimed it, and fired it at my head.
And it blew up in my face!
And what would have happened if it didn't?
I was under orders.
Were you also under orders when you ran
to Hardman about Monica Eton?
How do you know it was me?
Because I set it up!
Because I know who you are!
Are you still gonna tell me
you're not helping Allison?
Harvey, I swear to god
I did not do this.
Maybe not.
But now that you've done what you've done,
I will never trust you.
Pearson Hardman is my life.
Well, here's what's gonna happen from now on.
You and I, we're done.
Don't drop by my office.
Don't ask Donna for information.
You're the guy that nobody wants
but we can't get rid of.
I'm a senior partner.
So I can't make you leave.
But as far as I'm concerned,
you don't even work here anymore.
That glass does not look half-full.
You're cherry-picking Pearson Hardman associates.
I only want the best cherries.
Then why not go after the gardener who grew 'em?
You want to leave Pearson Hardman.
I'm a proven commodity who delivers outstanding billables.
With an unparalleled knowledge of finance.
Yeah, I'm well aware of who you are, Louis.
But how do I know that Harvey Specter
didn't just send you here?
'Cause I'm the last person that Harvey Specter would trust.
Just ask Daniel Hardman.
I did. He said you betrayed him.
Like I said, I am well aware of who you are.
Well, if you spoke to Daniel, then you would know
that he lost Pearson Hardman not because of my betrayal
but because of his own.
My loyalty does not sway with the wind.
I'm leaving Pearson Hardman
because there's no room for me there anymore.
You could go anywhere.
Well, I've done my homework.
You guys are expanding. You are hiring well.
You're gonna have a young staff
that needs guidance.
You know that I'm the right fit.
And I want to move now.
You have a non-compete clause.
Jessica is gonna waive the non-compete
as long as I don't take clients.
I wouldn't if I were her.
Well, you're not.
Harvey wants me gone,
and he has a way of getting what he wants, so--
There might be a partnership position for you.
Senior partnership.
That, you're gonna have to earn.
I have earned it.
And I'm not giving up what I've worked for my whole life.
Louis, you have made a tactical error.
You've shown me all your cards,
you can't offer any clients,
And you're being forced to leave a place
that doesn't want you.
You are a very good fit for us.
But if you want to join us,
you're gonna have to prove how much you want it.
Please don't do this.
Do what? I'm just negotiating.
You have an empty title.
If you come with us, I promise
that you will be truly valued.
Well, that's it.
I've talked to every client except Trent Devon.
Well, I know why he's returning
Allison's calls instead of yours.
Because he thinks we're not focused.
That's not enough.
Come on. You taught me to always ask...
What's in it for him?
"If we're looking to expand our reach,
then Trent Devon's data platform
provides the perfect symbiosis with our search algorithms."
Page 23, the CEO of Flash-Start.
Allison doesn't represent them.
Google bought Meebo for $100 million.
Allison is trying to do the same thing with Flash-Start.
Allison doesn't represent them.
Pretend she does.
Trent gets $100 million,
but his company gets swallowed up,
and that's not what he wants.
Well, what if they let him run both companies?
That's too good to be true.
It's happened before.
So if that's true, all we need to do
is figure out a way to beat that deal.
We can't beat that deal.
Okay. So what do we do?
Why didn't you just tell me?
Allison said you had a history
and that it might get in the way of what she was offering.
Flash-Start.
Very good.
But Allison doesn't represent them.
No, but she does represent a hedge fund
that's about to buy a controlling interest.
And let me guess.
They want you to run the whole thing.
We'll take on Google.
And let me guess.
You're here to try and beat it.
No, I'm here to tell you to take it.
If I were you, I would,
and I would hire the lawyer who brought it to me.
Thanks, Harvey.
You're welcome.
There's just one thing.
I wonder, what's in it for her?
What are you implying?
Let me look over the deal. My own time.
If it is what she says it is, I'll tell you.
If it's not, you'll want to know.
Harvey, I already told you--
Look.
You said we weren't focused,
and I'm not here to try to convince you that we were.
But you also said you've always trusted me,
and I'm telling you, trust me one more time.
Louis. Do you need something?
Actually, yes.
I need you to waive my non-compete,
so I can take a position at another firm.
Bratton Gould.
I had nothing to do with Allison Holt's poaching.
What did she offer you?
I went to her.
Why?
I got Harvey's message.
What message?
You don't know? It doesn't matter.
This is what he wants.
And this is what you want?
You know you can't take clients.
Oh, I wouldn't even if I could.
I have no desire to hurt our firm--
your firm.
Do you know why I instituted
the Louis Litt Rehabilitation Program?
Because I was seduced by Daniel Hardman once too.
He made me feel special and smart
and valued.
The problem was
he really didn't give a sh-- about me.
But I will give him one thing.
He was right about you.
You deserve a senior partnership.
I'm gonna let you go, Louis.
Just for the record,
I am not on the same page as Harvey.
I don't want you to go.
What?
Were we really quitting,
or was that just a move to get to the contract?
You don't think I have his best interests at heart?
That's not what I asked.
If it's a good deal, he should take it.
But you said it's too good to be true.
What else did I say?
That it's my job to help you.
So what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna go find out what's too good about it.
Good-bye, Mike.
Hey, you can quit all you want,
but Trent Devon is not leaving.
Okay. Good talk.
Yeah. You know who I am, asshole.
I'm sorry. Okay?
For what?
Sleeping with my wife?
What, you didn't do it on purpose?
It's over. Okay?
I swear to God.
You think it's that easy?
Keep your goddamn apology,
and stay the hell away from Tess!
Oh, my God. What the hell happened to you?
Oh, I don't want to talk about it.
With me. Now.
This isn't the first-aid kit from the kitchen.
Use other people's antibacterial cream?
Please, I might as well give myself a staph infection.
It's antibacterial.
That's what they want you to believe.
But you're using it.
Shh.
Looks like it's gonna bruise.
Oh, look, I'm sure it's gonna be fine, it's--
How do you know how to do this?
Bruno used to get into these fights
with this Maine Coon on the 37th floor.
Pumpkin.
No, I don't need it.
Here you go.
I don't need tissues.
Are you sure?
Put them down.
Are you gonna tell me what happened?
It's New York. I got jumped.
Didn't you call 911?
To have the police come and ask a million questions
about a guy who they're never gonna catch?
No, thanks.
You knew him.
Let's just say that actions have consequences.
Okay.
I get it. Yeah, I get that.
We gonna talk about that box you were carrying?
Oh, man. What box?
The box full of personal things from your office?
Like you said, actions have consequences.
Jessica fired you.
She asked me to stay.
She did?
Yeah, because she knows
that I would never sell out this firm.
Well, then I don't understand, what are you--
Mike, do I have to spell it out for you?
You're Harvey's right hand. He hates me.
So? Jessica's the boss.
Come on, Harvey's always hated you.
No, actually.
Harvey hasn't always hated me.
We were never Elmer and Bugs.
We were... Ralph and Sam.
Who?
Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog.
The cartoon characters?
Yeah.
They came to the meadow every day to work, friendly.
But then when they punched in the time clock,
Ralph would try to steal the sheep,
and Sam would stop him.
I mean, it was brutal.
And then they'd punch out again.
Friends.
And that was me and Harvey.
Harvey's not punching out anymore.
And I can't walk in here every day
knowing that I'm gonna be working side by side
next to somebody who despises me.
I just-- Mike, I can't.
Louis, if actions have consequences,
then maybe actions can redeem you.
No, it's too late for that.
Die's been already cast.
Here. You can send me a new tube of arnica
at your convenience.
You don't have to stay,
but I have some merger projections
that I have to go through for Harvey.
And I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be out of my depth.
Morning.
Thought I'd get in early and destroy Allison Holt.
How's that going?
It's a work in progress.
Louis's letter of resignation.
Found it on my desk this morning.
Good.
No.
Not good, Harvey.
We can agree to disagree.
We're not agreeing on anything.
You pushed Louis out the door.
It was not your call to make.
Louis may or may not have helped Allison,
but he has betrayed you, me, and this entire firm.
We're better off.
If you really believe that,
then something's got you off your game.
Jessica, I'm not off my--
No.
Not you. Me.
Your job is to help me.
And when I say you are off your game,
you say, "How do I get it back?"
I went to Louis to get him back on board,
and you made an end run around me.
When does it stop?
We can't let Trent go with Allison.
He's gonna...get screwed.
I'm--I'm sorry.
It's nothing.
It's just some stairs.
Oh, god.
I'm so sorry. I didn't see her there.
Who did this to you?
I'm fine.
You're not.
And after I'm done kicking his ass,
the guy who did it isn't gonna be either.
Harvey, just let it go.
That's not who I am.
I deserved it.
What did you do?
I don't want to tell you.
I wouldn't call this getting your shit together.
I don't want to tell you because of the story
you told me about your mom and your dad.
You got off easy.
I know.
It's a bad deal.
What, you're reading between the lines?
'cause I couldn't find anything in the contract.
Because the problem's not in the contract.
You said it yourself. The deal's too good to be true.
The financials don't support it.
What, you get your MBA overnight?
No.
You went to Louis?
We worked all night.
He didn't betray us, Harvey. He found the problem.
They never wanted anything to do with Trent's company.
After the deal, they're just gonna sell it off for spare parts.
That won't get them what they paid for it.
But it'll get them what they wanted.
Trent.
Exactly.
Louis figured this out?
Trent's contract has the same problem as Louis's.
He's got a non-compete.
They couldn't get him to run the company
unless they bought his.
Now Louis wants back in.
No, he doesn't.
This is just his way of saying he's sorry.
It's not on the menu, but might I suggest
the "I got my ass kicked" Martini?
It goes well with the "Second-tier law firm" Potato skins.
Those come with bacon?
I don't know, never had 'em.
I take it my client's not coming.
He was your client,
but then you offered him a deal too good to be true.
You got the paperwork.
Because he trusted me.
Well played, Harvey.
No. Here's the play.
He's gonna take his company public,
like I told him two months ago.
A deal my new client, a certain hedge fund,
just agreed to underwrite.
You know Edelson investments, don't you?
I do.
Apparently, I used to represent them.
Ah, you're taking this well.
What do you want me to do, cry?
Harvey, we play the game.
Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose.
Not me.
Which brings me to a suggestion of my own.
Come work for Bratton Gould.
Come work for you?
With me.
Did you not hear what I said about the potato skins?
You're second-tier.
What about you?
There's blood in the water, Harvey.
You may have fended off this attack,
but we're not the only ones circling.
We fended you off, we'll fendff the rest.
With who?
I got all your best senior associates,
your future, and I'm not done.
We'll see about that.
Lunch is on us.
After all, we just landed a huge, new client.
You say "we," but I don't see
your name on the door.
Mike, Mike, Mike. I got your call.
You said you owed me one, right?
Yeah, and I meant it too.
Well, you're gonna pay me back.
I'm happy to, 'cause listen to me,
when I bring you in,
and you kick ass, I look kick-ass.
Got your resume?
Right there.
You gotta be kidding me.
Oh, you didn't think it was gonna be easy to pay me back, did you?
Harold?
I'm not gonna look kick-ass.
I'm gonna look ass-kicked.
Look at how he did.
Are you kidding me?
You keep saying that.
Man, we talking about the same Harold?
I know.
Seriously, Mike, man,
If this doesn't work, I'm gonna look like shit.
Jimmy, he needs a second chance
just like you did.
All right, all right.
You won't regret it.
Harold's great.
You're gonna love his new tattoo.
He's here, isn't he?
Right over there.
Not only do you retain one client,
you landed another.
I knew there was a reason why I kept you around.
And a reason Allison Holt's trying to steal me away.
Congratulations. I'm sure you'll be very happy.
What could possibly go wrong?
Congratulations. That's what I said to Mike.
Him too? She's after everyone.
Don't worry. He's staying.
Loyal as a basset hound.
Oh. Are they particularly loyal?
I turned her down.
But?
I want my name on the door.
I don't want to end around you anymore.
I want to discuss things with you as an equal.
It's a little late for that, don't you think?
How long are we gonna walk by his name on the wall, huh?
They're coming after us,
and they're not gonna stop until we send them a message
that we are whole.
I'm not gonna just slap
someone else's name up there, Harvey.
"Someone"?
I told you once.
You don't make decisions when you're reeling from a loss.
And your response was, "Let's quit today."
Not quit. Fight.
Without any thought for the consequences.
With my gut, which serves me well.
As a closer, not a leader.
Jessica.
Watson, Glyman,
Gallo, Goldberg, Specter.
The first five senior partners you named.
The first five major moves I made.
All success stories.
Last week, you had me steal someone
from the D.A.'s office for reasons you won't say.
We won't even go into what you did to Louis.
And then there's the cherry on top.
Mike.
Who showed up this morning
beaten to a pulp.
He also beat Hardman to a pulp.
One day, what he is isn't going to be enough
to make up for what he isn't.
Which is how you feel about me.
Harvey, what was Michael Jordan's record on the Bulls?
664 wins, 285 losses.
More than twice as many wins than losses.
Do you know what his record was in the front office?
No.
185 to 291.
Almost twice as many losses as wins.
You know how I know that?
Because you knew one day, I'd come in here
asking for this.
Because I look at the future
like an adult.
Are you saying it's a no?
I'm saying I'm not rushing this decision
and that your judgment that day was wrong.
Thank you.
I thought you'd like to know
that Harold got a job at another firm.
Good.
Look, Rachel--
He found out, didn't he?
I just want you to know that it was
after I ended things with Tess.
