Over 68 million Americans
leave the safety of our borders every year.
If danger strikes,
the FBI's International Response Team
is called into action.
I bet you didn't know I could samba like that.
With you, nothing surprises me.
Oh, crap!
We need to post!
What? No!
Relax. We're on our honeymoon.
We're not at a photo shoot.
But all our adoring fans
and jealous friends await us.
Ah, well, then.
Wait, wait. Let me see it.
Oh, it's fine.
There's your fine and then there's mine.
It's good.
You mean you look good.
That's exactly what I mean.
Yeah.
There.
Let's get outta here. Come on.
I still can't believe we did it.
I've got the pictures, a wedding ring,
and a marriage certificate to prove it,
so don't get any crazy ideas.
I love you, Johnny.
I love you too, baby.
When we get back to the hotel,
I'm gonna show you how much.
That's gonna have to wait.
What? Holding out already?
I thought we had a few years before that started.
No, silly. I have a surprise for you.
But we have plans back at the hotel.
Okay, I know being spontaneous takes you out of your comfort zone,
but trust me, you're gonna like this.
Okay. Turn down here.
Keep going.
What's goin' on?
I have no idea.
They're right on our --
Why are they following us?
I don't know!
Just -- just don't stop.
Oh, God.
I'll take a cup of paranoia, please.
I know. We're so ridiculous.
I mean...
Josie, we'll revisit this in a few years.
You got to trust me on this one.
录取通知书
Hey, boss.
Everything all right?
Yeah. Josie got accepted to USC.
Congratulations.
Yeah, yeah. It's a great school.
I'm just not sure that she's ready
to move that far away from home.
She's not ready or you're not ready?
Okay, Simmons,
enough sharing the new crunch tips you learned.
It's good to see some things never change.
Except, you seem to be packing a bigger gun, this time around.
Well, it's been a long time since I shot anything.
I figure the bigger it is,
the better chance I have at hitting something.
Aloha.
Okay, let's download everyone, Monty.
Okay. American newlyweds John Davis,
a software developer;
and Susie Davis, a jewelry maker,
Are missing in San Pedro, Belize.
They were last seen
at a local watering hole named Serranos,
Where, I hear, the cow-foot soup is to die for.
Bride's father grew suspicious
when the couple suddenly stopped posting on social media
or wouldn't answer his calls.
So he called the hotel
and found out they got a hotel service car,
a red Jeep, 2 days ago, and never returned it.
They assumed that they they drove to the other side of the island
and eventually would come back.
His next call was to the U.S. consulate.
Where, it turns out, our newlyweds registered
as soon as they arrived.
Who registers with the consulate?
Somebody efficient, organized.
Speaking of, I just checked their credit cards
and it seems that they've been inactive
aver since they left Serranos 36 hours ago.
Unfortunately, the kidnapping of foreigners
by drug cartels in central America
and neighboring Mexico has become commonplace.
Except, there's been no ransom demand.
Monty, check with local PD.
See if any other tourists have gone missing in Belize
over the last few years.
You got it.
On a rural road at night? You think maybe
they saw something they shouldn't have?
Then they're definitely in trouble.
And they need our help.
An old Belizean Creole proverb tells us
"All journeys have secret destinations
of which the traveler is unaware."
So we don't have an embassy in San Pedro.
We'll check in with the consulate
and get clearance for all our weapons and vehicles.
Copy that.
Mae, I want you to meet with the RSO
to get a feel for the situation
on the ground there.
Way ahead of you, boss.
I already traded emails with the Regional Security Officer,
who gave me the lay of the land and
said that there have been no recent abductions.
Simmons, have you had a chance to run a topographic profile yet?
Yep, roger that.
The terrain they were last seen in changes very quickly
from paved roads to rainforest jungles.
And anything this beautiful has to be dangerous.
Funny, that is what my Tinder profile says.
Even though Belize borders with Mexico,
it has much more in common with the Caribbean.
That's why they all speak Creole.
Exactly. It's a pidgin language
derived mainly from English,
but includes Spanish and West African languages like Bantu and Akan.
Let me guess. You speak that, too.
What?
I so would've hated you in high school.
Jack, it's good to see you again.
You too -- how's the family doing?
Getting too big, too fast.
Oh, I know it all too well.
Thanks for having us.
Well, much like last time you were working here,
wish it was under better circumstances.
Well, let's see what we can do about changing that.
We ran a preliminary investigation.
We spoke to witnesses at Serranos,
followed the road that they drove on,
but weren't able to find them,
or anything criminal in nature.
So your team has concluded
there was no crime committed here?
Well, there's always the possibility of a crime having taken place,
but, with our small police force, limited resources,
we have done everything we could within our capabilities.
Well, you mind if we kick the tires on this?
Of course not.
Just try not to scare away too many of the tourists.
Jack. Monty's on the batphone.
I got your notes on the RSO,
saying there've been no recent tourist kidnappings in Belize.
My search is showing the same thing, going 5 years back.
Monty, throw out a wire net with Interpol.
See what comes back.
You've got it, boss.
What else can you tell us about our lovebirds?
They've got quite the social media footprint:
Facebook, Twitter, Sweet Source Page.
Sweet Source?
Crowdbased fundraiser,
so that couples who are financially challenged
can help to raise money for their dream honeymoons.
So they weren't targeted for their money.
They certainly do look very much in love.
Having a blast. Miss you.
Thank you!
It's well-planned, detailed.
Yeah, by giving away locations and times,
they're making it easier for them to be tracked.
So the unsub could've stalked them via posts,
saw them more up close and personal,
and then followed them that night.
Monty, see if anyone local
was checking out our honeymooners' site.
I already parsed the access logs,
to identify any site visitors
with source routing that originated in Belize.
Now, I'm just filtering traffic, looking for packets
that traveled through the Latin American
or Caribbean internet exchanges,
but nothing's popping up.
Well, if we go by their set itinerary,
they were supposed to come back to the hotel
for a romantic candlelit dinner, but never made it.
Clara, Mae, pay a visit to the hotel
and see if you find any leads.
Simmons, go to the road near Serranos
and see if anything pops out at ya.
I'm Randall Cowen. I-I just flew in.
My daughter's S-Susie Davis,
the missing bride.
I'm Jack Garrett, FBI.
Why don't we step outside here?
Sorry to make you wait.
I'm Agent Russell Montgomery
with the FBI's International Response Team.
I'm Steven Davis.
This is my wife, Mary.
What's going on?
We spoke to Susie's father, Randall.
He said that they got into some kind of trouble on their honeymoon?
Unfortunately, yes,
but we have boots on the ground
and we're knee-deep in an investigation.
What happened?
We're not completely sure, yet,
but we do know that they're missing.
We're doing the best that we can,
so let's try to stay positive.
Mr. Cowen, I'm a father also,
so I can imagine how difficult this must be.
Rest assured, we're on top of it.
I appreciate that, agent.
So, anything you can tell me, at all, about John and Susie?
Any troubles?
Not that I know of.
They seem very much in love.
Is there any tension between you and your daughter?
No, no. Why do you ask?
Well, you seem to be a man of means,
but your daughter had to raise money for her own honeymoon.
When my wife died, Susie was all I had left.
What I saw as protection, she saw as smothering.
So, when she turned 18,
she decided to march to the beat of her down drum,
and with that came financial independence.
One day, you're coming home and they're yelling "Daddy"
and jumping into your arms and,
before you know it, it stops.
Anything else?
Susie's a spark plug. If she's in trouble,
she'll fight to the end.
Please stay by your phone.
We'll let you know anything as soon as we do.
Thank you.
At least she's a fighter.
That's not good.
Fighters can end up dead quickly,
depending on who's holding them.
He-e-e-lp!
Please!
Someone, anyone, please, help!
Susie? Susie, you there?
John? John, are you okay?
I'm in a lot of pain.
Okay. Okay, we have to get out of here.
Can you see anything? A door? Some way out?
No.
John. John.
John, look out!
We're gonna need full access to your security footage.
That way, we can review or interview any guests
they may have spoke to.
These people are on vacation.
We understand that, ma'am.
But their lives might be in danger,
so any information that we have can help out.
I'll have security get you what you need.
This way.
Makin' friends everywhere we go.
Thank you.
You take the left?
Yep.
I told you, while you were gone,
that I almost got married, right?
No.
I met this guy and we just really,
really fell hard for each other and...
decided to take the plunge.
Then, I had to choose between him and the job, so,
I chose good-old J Edgar.
Mae, if your fiance made you choose,
he wasn't the right guy, in the first place.
Well, he didn't make me choose, but he would've,
so I just decided to rip the band-aid off
and spare us both the inevitable.
So, wait, it was your decision, not his?
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.
I'm sorry. That's none of my business.
Well, the husband's side of the room
would've made Felix Unger proud.
Yeah, well, the wife's side looks like Chernobyl.
So the husband is organized.
He set the itinerary.
They were planning a romantic,
candlelit dinner on the hotel beach.
If John was so very detailed,
what threw them off course?
Abduction?
Maybe.
Or Susie.
Just look at the way she packed.
Looks like she was ready for anything.
Or she's a hot mess.
Trust me, there's something to all this madness.
She's spur of the moment.
She's spontaneous and she could've changed the plans.
Let's give Monty a call.
Hello, angels.
I was just about to drop you a line.
I just spoke to John's parents,
who said that he and the missus were complete opposites.
He was...
Neat and she was a slob?
They said it more eloquently than that, but yes.
Any luck on Susie's emails, texts,
and/or search engines, por favor?
First off, there's nothing normal about Susie.
Her search engine is like a Jackson Pollock painting:
Fashion, gluten-free recipes, waxing secrets,
"Which 'survivor' contestant are you?"
All of these searches are things you can get or have for free.
It just reiterates that they didn't have very much money.
Look, I know you said their credit cards
went dead 36 hours ago,
but what about any charges out of the norm
before they went to Belize?
Ah, there's some small purchases, here and there,
some nickel-and-dime stuff for food and water,
but there is one that's a little bit more expensive,
from a place called Supernova.
What is that?
It's an online company where you can purchase a star.
Oh, yeah. I've heard of that.
You can give them as gifts
or name them after loved ones.
Maybe it was a honeymoon gift.
According to his social media page,
his love is for astronomy.
He is the president of his local Amateur Astronomers' Association.
Nerd city.
Which I am a proud member of.
Well, if the shoe fits.
Monty, did Susie buy John a telescope?
Yeah, I was about to get to that:
Top-of-the-line, from a local store near their home.
Susie was gonna surprise John with a star.
Monty, I want you to find the best place for stargazing in Belize
and let Simmons know.
My guess is that's where they were last heading
before they went off the grid.
Simmons, this is your conscience speaking.
I'm sure glad my conscience is a genius.
You know, there's seven levels of intelligence
and three types of genius?
Lucky for you, I'm all of the above.
Brag much?
Only to my friends,
and girls I meet at Applebee's happy hour.
Low-hanging fruit.
Hey, I work 14 hours a day
and live with my grandmother.
Fair enough. What do you got for me?
Looks like our honeymooners were going stargazing.
That seems to be everywhere. Just look up.
True that, but people from all walks of life
come to stargaze at Belize's world-renowned coral atolls.
I'll put that on the bucket list.
To get there, they would've had to travel by boat
by leaving from Banyan Bay,
which means that
they would've turned right in a 1/2-mile.
I think I may have found where our couple went offroading.
Our vics were driving a red jeep, right?
Yes, sir. It was a part of their honeymoon package.
In pursuit!
Of what?
The evidence.
Pull over!
FBI! Don't move!
Monty, give the team my coordinates.
I'm gonna need Clara for this.
He's speaking Creole.
So, people from the island,
they call him and tell him where the junk is.
He goes, he picks it up, sells it as scrap metal.
He was just doing his job.
So why'd he run?
Why?
'cause I no know you.
He speaks English.
Yes. Creole is based in English.
Man, that is a hell of a dent.
What kind of car rail would cause that?
None.
This dent was made by a battering ram mounted on a bumper,
to inflict impact without taking any in return.
And it was hit in the passenger side,
so they never saw it coming.
It's a classic blitz attack.
It's not intended to kill, but to push them off the road.
The method of attack is significant.
These people were taken.
Might already be dead.
Unless we have a body,
we have to assume they're still alive.
Move!
No!
Move!
I'm not seeing any signs of deception.
He's making clear eye contact.
He's using an active voice.
He's not equivocating or self-minimizing.
And his record is clean,
so he's being straight with us.
How do people let you know
about junk around the island?
He says somebody calls him,
just like the man who told him about the jeep.
Do you know this man?
The man came into his shop, told him that he was
on his way to go fishing.
And saw a jeep just off the road,
down in the ravine.
What'd he look like?
He wore sunglasses and a baseball hat,
so he didn't get a great look at his face.
And he was tan and spoke Creole,
so he was definitely local.
I asked him if there was anything else
that he saw, out of the ordinary,
and he said that he knows fishing
and that man was no fisherman.
So he gets the tow truck driver
to clean up his mess for him
and then contaminate any evidence in the process.
He wasn't fishing.
No.
He was trying to get rid of something in the bay.
Or someone.
Tillet, how about we go fishing?
Your hunch was right.
Our officers found a bloated body in the bay
about a kilometer from shore.
Looks like it was in the water a short time.
Is it the husband?
Most of him.
His hands and feet are missing.
应急帐篷
Why is this tent in the middle of the beach?
The guests are seeing this.
It's causing concerns.
It's not our intention,
but this is the scene of a crime.
And, since San Pedro doesn't have a morgue,
we're gonna have to do an onsite autopsy.
Did you say autopsy?
What are you thinking, Clara?
You know, removing the hands and feet
are usually used as either a form of punishment
for a crime, such as thievery,
or as a method of torture.
I mean, sometimes they --
Male, 25 to 30.
Unsub knows his way around a blade.
They are not surgical, but they are clean.
Marks on the neck,
torso, and ankles show that the victim
was weighted down in the water,
probably by fishing line.
Open his shirt.
Where is his heart?
The missing heart, along with the hands and feet,
point to this being an ancient Mayan ritual.
Which tracks, since Belize
was ground zero for Mayan culture.
Right, but he is not just cutting them off and out.
He's actually eating them.
It's an act of dominance.
Eating the heart is an effort to absorb
the victim's strength, while the hands and feet
represent the most extreme ends of the body,
thus encapsulating the whole being.
Knife marks, clean cuts, no hesitations.
So he weighted down the body with weights,
but, somehow, John got loose.
Low tide.
Slack water got pulled back out of the ocean
and a current could've shaken our DB loose
from his watery grave.
Appears he's a mission-oriented,
anger-excitation killer.
He targeted the Davises,
with the intention to ritualistically kill the husband.
Which is in step with the Mayan rules
of engagement with other warriors.
His need to remove the hands and feet
is all part of a premeditated delusion.
He's sadistic, fueled by fantasies.
And, in modeling himself after a traditional Mayan warrior,
the unsub is building confidence
and adding credence to his fantasy.
Which, in itself, is a form of association and detachment
that allows him to justify his actions.
His social skills, like with the tow-truck driver,
suggest that he could be living a normal life,
Probably be employed, mid-30s.
Well, why cut his heart out, then put his shirt back on?
Dressing can be a form of remorse.
But then, that contradicts
the brutality in which he kills.
Which then speaks to it being a compulsion
or part of his ritual.
The weighting and the dumping of the body
could be a forensic countermeasure?
It suggests that he's done this before.
So, potentially, there are more victims in the water.
We need to drag the bay, ASAP.
I'm sorry, Jack, I don't have those kind of resources.
Well, I do actually. I have an old military buddy
who opened a dive shop down here. I'll give him a call.
I forgot. You always have a guy.
Autopsy notes on two male skeletons pulled out of the bay,
both missing hands and feet.
I'm all ears.
Monty, how's that security footage from the hotel going?
Nothing yet, but I'm still looking through it.
It's a couple weeks' worth of security footage.
Copy.
I've told so many people that they've lost loved ones.
It never gets any easier.
And, Monty, it never will.
But you help more than you know.
I'm so sorry.
Is that my little girl?
Sir, everyone behind the yellow tape here.
Mr. Cowen.
She in there?
It's Johnny, not Susie.
Oh, God.
Is she dead, too?
We don't know yet.
But she could be?
What if I never see her again?
You can't think like that.
Okay, my buddies over at interpol
finally got back to me.
We ran the DNA on the two skeletons
that were just dragged out of the bay and we got a hit.
Both were males,
however, we were able to identify one
as Anuk Michelson, 35, Dutch.
Last known photo was taken a week
before he and his new wife, Monica, disappeared.
Local authorities said, after renting a car,
they took off on a day trip and never returned.
I remember this.
About a year ago, Anuk's parents
wanted their son to be pronounced dead
so they could claim the insurance policy.
The insurance company performed an investigation
and concluded there was no proof of foul play
Or that Anuk and his wife were deceased.
They theorized that Anuk and his new bride skipped town
to avoid their growing debt.
We accepted the insurance company's findings.
No body, no crime.
Clara, anything come from the interviews?
All of the hotel guests and employees were clean,
or at least had solid alibis.
So, both missing couples were honeymooners.
Monty, look into anything else that's happened in that bay
over the last few years.
You got it.
What's going on here?
What are you doing to me?
Why am I wearing a wedding dress?
Because we will be married.
What?
What are you talking about?
You should want to marry me.
I am strong.
I will protect you.
What did you do to John?
Oh, my God.
The unsub is killing and consuming part of the males,
but keeping the females alive,
thus absorbing their strength and their property,
which was a common warrior practice.
Property?
Historically, women were considered
legal possessions that men could leverage
for a variety of reasons.
Three dead bodies, all males,
so why does the unsub feel the need
to keep reasserting his dominance?
His M.O. is so specific.
It's doubtful he killed the women in a different way.
Which means they're probably still alive.
So what if he's taking the dead men's women as his wives?
So our unsub is not only a cannibal,
but also a polygamist?
Mayans were monogamous.
The only practicing polygamists in the area were Aztecs.
So this ritual is Aztec, not Mayan?
But Aztecs were Mexican?
Right.
So we're looking for a mestizo who's good with a blade
and had access to all of our victims.
Papa!
Honey!
Why this whole Aztec thing?
Why does that speak to him?
Regressing to a culture where men were conquerors
has allowed him to find his place in this world.
I want you to meet someone special.
This is Susie.
She will be another mommy.
I reached out to my friends at a webpage called
The Global Missing Peoples Network.
Denise Brown of Toronto posted
about her daughter Trish Brown's
mysterious disappearance 3 years ago in Belize,
失踪日期 2012年10月12日
where she met a boy named Colin Jackson on a cruise ship
and they eloped.
Where were they last seen?
At the San Pedro courthouse.
Here's the last photo they took.
You remember this, Tillet?
We didn't handle that.
Yeah, because Trish and Colin came in on a cruise ship,
It fell under maritime law,
so the Belize police department didn't investigate.
Ship security botched the investigation
and eventually filed it with Canadian Interpol
as a cold case.
So we believe this third body
could possibly belong to Colin Jackson?
Same height;
Estimated weight, based off bone density;
makes it more than likely that it is.
Now, Trish and Colin
borrowed Denise's credit card so they could
rent a car for the day, to see the island.
Two out of our three couples rented cars.
The other was a hotel-assigned guest car.
Simmons, get on the horn.
Find out where that hotel gets their cars.
Now, I crossreferenced all the dates that our three couples
either went off the grid or were declared missing,
and they all seem to fall
within the first few weeks of October.
Focus on traumatic events occurring in the first part of October.
Combine that with information you find out on the bay.
Let's shake something out of this tree.
What have you got?
Okay, I uncovered an event from 3 years ago.
A car accident took place near the bay,
Same location the dead bodies were dumped.
Go on.
A tourist couple in belize
On their honeymoon killed a local woman, Rosa Kiaten,
when they hit her car directly into the bay.
Her body was uncovered by her husband,
Antonio, a local butcher.
If this is the unsub's wife,
it explains why he's so good with a blade.
But this happened on April 21st, not in October.
The death could be a stressor, the foundation of his mania,
but it could be something else that triggers him.
The Aztecs have an elaborate calendar
full of numerous festivals and ceremonies.
October 13th is the day of the Jaguar.
Aztecs believed that it was a good day to do battle.
Monty, we need an address for Antonio, ASAP.
Got it. Antonio and his wife
shared a place above the family butcher shop.
He's attacking tourists with a car,
like the one that killed his wife.
"You took my beloved. Now, I take yours."
It's mano a mano.
His actions are demonstrating extreme arrogance
and a sense of entitlement.
Not just entitlement.
In devouring the flesh of his enemies,
Aztec warriors were embodying their gods.
So, by eating people,
the aztec warrior becomes a god.
Sorry, everyone,
but I'm going to need to reroute you.
Antonio closed the butcher business
soon after his wife's death and moved.
I'm checking tax records to see where to.
Okay. The hotel rental car and both of the other rentals
came from San Pedro Car Rental.
And guess what.
Tax documents say Antonio started working there 3 years ago.
And rental car companies are independent contractors.
They're not hotel employees.
That's why we never interviewed him.
But, working a car rental window
explains how he had access to all the couples.
And how he knew when to attack at their most vulnerable moment,
because he could GPS their every movement.
No!
Time for us to all go to a better place.
Freeze! FBI!
There's no need to do this.
We can keep your family safe.
Only I can protect my family.
You think that, by controlling women,
that, somehow, makes you more of a man?
Real men don't hurt their families.
They love them. They protect them.
You're not a man.
You're just a coward.
Shut up!
You're weak.
You are weak.
No.
I am strong.
I am a god.
You're not a god.
A god could've saved your wife, Rosa!
You're just a fraud!
You're a fake! You're a failure!
No!
They're still alive.
We need a paramedic.
Oh, sweetheart.
Daddy.
She okay?
Um, beyond the obvious trauma,
she's dehydrated, but, she'll make it.
The other two women?
They'll physically be okay, but,
Stockholm Syndrome survivors
tend to have mixed results.
I'm sorry that it got weird between us in the hotel room.
No, I-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for being so judgmental.
It's not judgmental if it's true.
It's just that, what we do, it's so dangerous and scary,
and it's made me afraid of any kind of commitment
and I just don't wanna make someone...
Like me?
That's not what I meant.
Okay, I would be a liar if I said that
it hadn't crossed my mind.
Look, Mae, losing Brad, it hurt. It hurt like hell.
But what would've hurt even more?
Never having been with him.
No, when you love someone,
you love 'em unconditionally.
They know the risk.
That was one for the playbooks.
Just glad you're a good shot.
I couldn't help but think about my daughters.
The look in that little girl's face.
Well, being able to relate to those moments
is what makes you a good agent.
Maybe so, but as a parent,
it scares the hell outta me.
I just wanna protect 'em forever.
I love you, Susie.
I'll be right back.
Yeah.
Hi, honey. It's dad.
I'm in Belize.
I was just --
I was just thinking about you and us
and school and...
I can't wait to visit you at USC.
I love you, too.
What am I doing now?
Coming home.
