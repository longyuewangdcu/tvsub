why do i always have to carry the heavy stuff ?
well , it &apos;s very simple .
in our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose ,
i &apos;m the smart one ,
wolowitz is the funny one ,
and koothrappali is the lovable foreigner
who struggles to understand our ways and fails .
that leaves you , by default , as the muscle .
one more floor , and i &apos;d be the pulled muscle .
oh , it &apos;s about time . i &apos;m starving .
um , well , we didn &apos;t actually get chinese food .
why not ?
don &apos;t panic . this is better .
oh , no . you didn &apos;t trade the food for magic beans , did you ?
of course not .
and technically , magic beans would be food .
although eating them would be quite a waste ,
since you could plant them ,
and overnight , have a giant beanstalk ,
which would provide enough roughage for a small city .
yeah , sometimes i don &apos;t listen .
sometimes i just watch your jaw go up and down .
we were on our way to the chinese restaurant
when we thought we saw adam west ,
so we followed him .
who &apos;s adam west ?
who &apos;s adam west ? !
leonard , what do the two of you talk about after the coitus ?
my guess is , &quot; hey , four minutes ! new record ! &quot;
that &apos;s why i &apos;m the funny one .
anyway , we followed the guy to this garage sale ,
and they had the coolest stuff .
they were closing up .
we got this whole box for 60 bucks .
we didn &apos;t even get to go through it all .
there could be anything in here .
there a new girlfriend in there ? &apos; cause you might need one .
no .
but there is an original final draft ghostbusters script
with actual slime stains !
oh , you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s ghostbusters 2 .
never mind .
oh , my god .
an alf doll .
when i was 11 , my mother got me one
to help me sleep after my dad left .
i used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet melmac ,
and alf was going to bring him back to me .
but he never did .
where &apos;s my daddy , puppet ?
where is he ?
that is so sad .
no , what &apos;s sad is that you don &apos;t know
adam west was tv &apos;s batman .
here &apos;s spock &apos;s head with no body .
here &apos;s mr.t &apos;s body with no head .
oh , yeah , here &apos;s spock &apos;s body with mr.t &apos;s head .
i pity the fool who &apos;s illogical .
okay , i &apos;m just gonna go home
and make a grilled cheese and window @-@ shop on eharmony .
okay , bye .
okay .
ooh , look , an indiana jones connect @-@ the @-@ dots .
and an aquaman action figure .
looks like someone drew a penis on him .
ooh , that &apos;ll come off .
you see what you &apos;re doing ?
stop that .
fascinating .
what ?
it appears to be a lord of the rings ring .
oh . it &apos;s even got
the elvish engraving on it .
it &apos;s not elvish .
it &apos;s the language of mordor written in elvish script .
&quot; one ring to rule them all . &quot;
&quot; one ring to find them . &quot;
&quot; one ring to bring them all . &quot;
&quot; and in the darkness bind them . &quot;
holy crap , are we nerdy .
so , i was doing some checking on the ring .
hold on . sheldon , is there ketchup on that table ?
yes , there is .
oh , here &apos;s a fun fact . ketchup started out as a general term for sauce ,
typically made of mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices .
some popular early main ingredients included blueberry ,
anchovy , oyster , kidney bean and grape .
no , that &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll get it .
listen , i was looking at the ring , and it seemed a little weird .
no copyright notice on it .
so , i took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with--
shall we say-- the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world .
seedy underbelly ?
you know , your black market phasers ,
your screen @-@ worn lieutenant uhura panties ,
that kind of stuff .
who &apos;s this mysterious buddy you suddenly have ?
just a guy . i know a guy .
is it eddie crispo ?
no , i can &apos;t tell you who it is . stop asking .
who else could it be ? it has to be eddie crispo .
i know lots of dangerous people , okay ?
name one .
eddie crispo .
anyway , he said this isn &apos;t a replica . it &apos;s the real deal .
if you &apos;re suggesting that that is the actual ring of power
forged by sauron in mount doom ,
i look at you with an expression of exhaustion
and ever so slight amusement .
he &apos;s not saying it &apos;s a magic ring .
you &apos;re not , are you ?
no , but it &apos;s close .
look at the markings inside .
those are production markings .
nine rings were made for use in the &lt; i &gt; lord of the rings movies . &lt; / i &gt;
three were given to members of the cast .
the rest were destroyed .
except one .
one was stolen .
gentlemen ...
this is the one ring .
mine !
no , it is not yours .
we all went in on the box together .
well , yes , but i found it in the box ,
and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state
that the finder of a sunken treasure
is the owner of the treasure .
how is this maritime salvage ?
other than the lack of water , how is it not ?
wait , wait . sheldon , stop being crazy for a second .
how much is something like this worth ?
well , it &apos;s tough to say since it &apos;s hot ,
but on the underground market , my guy figures ...
your guy eddie crispo ?
yes .
he figures ten , maybe 15 thousand .
okay , that &apos;s a lot of money .
the wise thing to do is invest it in something practical .
like a jet ski .
why do you want a jet ski ?
all the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride jet skis .
that can &apos;t just be a coincidence .
we can &apos;t sell it .
we have to keep it
and love it and polish it ,
and only take it out occasionally
when we go to the park
and reenact our favorite scenes from the movies .
it &apos;s sad how great that sounds .
guys , it &apos;s stolen .
it should go back to peter jackson .
he made the movies ; it belongs to him .
fine .
he can have it back as long as he promises
to make me a hobbit in his next movie .
there are no jewish hobbits .
clearly , you &apos;ve never been to my house
for dinner on rosh hashanah .
we are not blackmailing peter j ...
all right , where &apos;s the ring ?
you mean my ring ?
what are you doing ?
the ring was unguarded .
it was just sitting on the table .
anyone could have taken it .
proof ? i did .
give me that .
look , let &apos;s be reasonable .
we all want to do different things with the ring ,
but your ideas are stupid , and i want a jet ski .
i found it . the ring is mine .
i don &apos;t understand why in this group i never get my way .
you always get your way .
i &apos;ll stipulate to that if you give me the ring .
hey , guys .
enjoying your food that i actually
brought you instead of promising food ,
but bringing you a box of random crap ?
yeah , it &apos;s delicious .
the sarcasm &apos;s a little stale , though .
hey , how about this ?
until we figure out what to do with the ring ,
penny holds on to it .
what ring ?
this ring .
looking for something ?
will you hold on to this for a couple of days ?
why ?
it &apos;s a prop from a movie ,
and we &apos;re kind of fighting over it .
okay , just to be clear , the first piece of jewelry
my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie ,
and i don &apos;t even get to keep it ?
if you had gone out with me three years ago ,
by now , you &apos;d have my great aunt ida &apos;s brooch
that she smuggled out of occupied belgium in a cat .
how am i looking now ?
you hit me !
i &apos;m bleeding !
what was that ?
sheldon tried to take the ring and i punched him .
that &apos;s my girl .
so , sheldon ,
how &apos;s it feel to get beaten up by a girl ?
it &apos;s not the first time .
i have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero .
if only i &apos;d had the presence of mind to reabsorb her ,
then i &apos;d have a mole with hair in it
instead of a tedious yearly christmas letter .
gentlemen , have you come to the realization
that the only reasonable course of action
is to sell the ring and divide the money ?
no .
i was afraid of that .
go ahead .
greetings from mumbai .
i am raj &apos;s attorney , venkatesh koothrappali .
also my cousin .
you brought a lawyer ?
don &apos;t answer that .
i &apos;ll get straight to the point .
my client &apos;s prepared to surrender
any interest he has in the ring
in exchange for two kawasaki jet skis .
we &apos;re not giving him two jet skis .
look , we &apos;re big boys ,
why don &apos;t we just cut to the chase and meet in the middle ?
one kawasaki jet ski . done and done .
no jet skis .
all right , forget the jet skis .
forget the jet skis ? that was our line in the sand !
what happened to &quot; tear them a new one ? &quot;
what can i say ? they played hardball . we lost .
you &apos;re useless .
i told you that when you hired me .
i &apos;m signing off now .
call your mother . she worries .
okay , just so you know , if we &apos;re bringing in cousins who are lawyers ,
prepare for shock and awe .
you know what ? i am ending this .
penny didn &apos;t want to hold the ring anymore .
she gave it to me . i have it . i &apos;m sending it back .
where &apos;s the ring ?
you mean this ring ?
next time be aware of your surroundings
while urinating in a public men &apos;s room .
give me that .
no , it &apos;s mine .
it &apos;s all of ours .
okay , now , this is ridiculous !
then let go !
i &apos;m not letting go . you let go .
i say this ring belongs
to the last person who can hold on .
fine . but can &apos;t we go home and start this ?
sure . let go of the ring .
all right , it starts now .
you do realize there &apos;s a giant bug movie marathon
tonight on the syfy channel .
wait , my laptop .
you know , there &apos;s a point no when this becomes idiotic .
and it wasn &apos;t when we were driving like this ?
i would advise the three of you
that resistance is futile .
i have endless patience .
i once spent two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours on hold
with hewlett @-@ packard customer service
just to complain about their customer service .
you want to talk about endless patience ?
penny made me watch all five seasons
of sex and the city .
there are six seasons , dude .
oh , crap !
no , no , no , the sixth season is great .
we go to paris with carrie and get our heart broken ,
and then mr. big shows up ,
we don &apos;t know if we can trust him again .
it &apos;s a wild ride .
door .
okay , everybody , and plie ?
and releve ?
whatcha doin &apos; ?
last one holding the ring decides its fate .
i know , it sounds silly .
no , no , no , no , no , you are my boyfriend .
nothing you do is silly to me .
thank you .
fyi-- this is a bag from victoria &apos;s secret .
i &apos;m out .
i &apos;m sorry , ma ,
i have to stay late at the office .
no , he &apos;s doesn &apos;t ! he &apos;s lying to you !
will you be quiet ?
well , if you want privacy let go of the ring .
i &apos;m so glad
we came to this gentile strip club !
howard ,
here &apos;s more bacon to tuck into the shiksa &apos;s g @-@ string !
i &apos;ll call you back .
i think it &apos;s lovely you call your mommy
and let her know you &apos;re going to be late for dinner .
from what i know about these things ,
if a woman doesn &apos;t breast @-@ feed on time ,
it &apos;s very uncomfortable for her boobies .
don &apos;t you talk about my mother &apos;s boobies !
if you &apos;re offended , let go of the ring
and go on home to your mother &apos;s boobies .
excellent , excellent .
tire each other out , the ring will be mine .
howard , why don &apos;t you go after raj &apos;s mother ?
why don &apos;t we go after &lt; i &gt; your &lt; / i &gt; mother ?
go ahead .
i have no illusions about my mother .
she is a kind , loving ,
religiously fanatical right @-@ wing texan
with a slightly out @-@ of @-@ scale head
and a mild dr. pepper addiction .
anything you &apos;d like to add ?
that &apos;s not gonna get you anywhere .
better pull out the big gun .
you &apos;re right .
let &apos;s talk about your grandmother .
no !
i call no meemaws .
think about this .
the only way your mother was born was your meemaw had sex .
i don &apos;t want to hear this .
then let go of the ring and walk away .
never .
all right .
i &apos;ll bet your meemaw
didn &apos;t just have sex to have your mother .
i bet she had sex because she liked it .
stop it !
yeah , meemaw did the nasty .
i said stop it !
we &apos;re getting to him .
waterfalls !
what ?
waterfalls .
crashing waves .
babbling brooks .
what are you doing ?
subliminal messaging .
i &apos;m going to make you want to pee .
dripping faucets .
leaky gutter .
peeing .
it &apos;s , it &apos;s not working , dude .
oh @-@ ho @-@ ho , it &apos;s working all right .
i have to pee .
then let go of the ring and go .
no , actually , i wouldn &apos;t mind going , too .
fine .
um , on the count of three .
one , two ...
wait , just to clarify .
when you get to three , do we stand up or do we pee ?
we stand up .
excellent choice .
three .
something tells me
this was a bad day to wear suede shoes .
i &apos;ve done it !
i &apos;ve won !
the ring is mine !
it &apos;s mine !
we &apos;re going to clean it up and make it pretty .
my own .
my love .
my precious .
where &apos;s the ring ?
it &apos;s in a fedex box on its way back to where it came from .
the fires of mount doom ?
peter jackson &apos;s office in new zealand .
it wasn &apos;t ours .
you quit the game !
you had no right to take it .
i came in here , you guys were all sleeping .
the ring was on the floor . no one was touching it .
well , so then we start the game over until there &apos;s a winner .
there wasn &apos;t ever going to be a winner .
there was going to be a selfish , petty person with a ring
and three people who used to be his friend .
is that really what you guys want ?
&apos;cause if it is , fine .
i don &apos;t want anything to do with you .
and i don &apos;t know what happened in that bathroom ,
but i am not cleaning it up !
my precious .
i knew it .
give us the precious !
give me ! give me !
get off of me !
give me the ring !
it &apos;s mine !
ugh , gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym .
just give me the ring !
give it to me !
give me the ring !
i said give it to me !
