Abed, what are you doing?
Freelancing.
You're not a spy for the city, are you?
They've been sending footage of my classroom
and pronounced me no worse than the teachers that work hard.
I can't tell you who I'm working for.
It's a surprise.
Well, don't get in the way.
You know the rules, Jeff.
The sooner you ignore me, the sooner I stop being a factor.
All right, people.
Yesterday
I wrote the word law on the board.
This time, don't erase it,
and maybe tomorrow we'll get even further.
Now, I'm told Garrett has
prepared a presentation for extra credit.
By the way, everyone in class
gets the credit because I'm not sure how
much I should encourage this.
Go ahead, Garrett.
Thank you.
My presentation is about Marriage Law.
This is me, Garrett.
I'm in your class.
This is Stacy.
She is in our class as well.
This is what I want.
Oh, Garrett.
Stacy, will you marry me?
Yes, yes, Garrett, yes, I will!
Oh, Garrett!
Garrett and I have been seeing each other for
16 months, two weeks, and four days.
We met at the school store, Pencils and Such.
He said he was there for the Such.
I remember I was sweating a lot, and breathing heavy, and
my heart felt like it was going to burst in my chest.
But the day I met Stacy,
most of those symptoms actually declined.
Are you quite done?
Yeah.
Garrett wanted the proposal recorded.
He thought his family might wanna see proof.
So now what are you shooting?
You had a strange look on your face.
Oh, you're noticing faces now?
Aren't you still smelling hair
to tell Frankie from Annie?
Yeah.
Well, it's official.
I'm getting laid.
第六季 第十二集
What are you doing?
Stop.
Hey, stop.
If you don't put that silly thing away,
I swear, I'm gonna stop loving you.
Oh, that's it.
Happy birthday.
What are you two doing?
We're doing Annie's Missing Lover footage.
You, you know in movies where
the hero's wife or girlfriend is dead or missing,
and so he sits in the dark
and he watches her in a home movie, or-
or a hologram.
Or a hologram over and over,
and she's always beautiful and full of love,
almost to the point of being stupid.
We're making footage like
that for me in case I get kidnapped or murdered.
Oh, super healthy, guys.
The Health Department called.
They don't want anything back.
Britta, don't look at the camera.
Okay, look at the camera.
Today's Garrett's wedding.
For those who don't know, Garrett,
he's a guy we don't really know,
that we've known for like six years at school,
the funny-looking guy.
Britta, mean!
Sorry!
The eccentric-looking guy.
What's happening?
Everything's going wrong.
That guy.
Remember when we said we were cleaning?
Yeah. But remember about Abed's documentary?
The documentary is about what we're doing.
And we're cleaning.
Yeah, but if we're both cleaning
then there's nobody to explain why.
She doesn't understand filmmaking.
I lived in New York.
What else should we talk about?
We volunteered our apartment
as a staging area where our friends
can get ready and keep each other on time.
The thing to understand about our friends
is that friends isn't an adequate label.
We're an intensely, intimately bonded crew.
God. Oh, I can't, no!
No!
Do you want flashy forward, or cherry and classic?
Do you have black?
That's a no.
That beleaguered sigh means,
no, I can't have black nails.
Don't look at the camera.
You absolutely can,
and we all will when our bodies decompose.
Please don't Jim the camera like that.
Jim the camera?
The color black hasn't had
It's not a color.
Anything to do with death or edginess since '89!
I mean, absence of color.
My accountant has black nails!
Your what?!
Don't jump on that,
my accountant, it's a figure of speech.
It's a form of speech called making things up.
Abed, can you get that?
I can film you getting it.
It's open!
Is it?
I don't know, let's see.
Frankie.
Hi girl.
So, I didn't, put on my wedding clothes, like you said.
So we can get dressed together and be girls together.
This is gonna be fun.
Annie and Britta told me to come over and
get ready with them for Garrett's wedding.
I didn't say no.
Who says no to something like that?
A cold, off-putting incompatible person.
The kind of person that turns a sleepover into a stoning.
I had rocks, thrown at me.
Biblical, igneous, jagged,
hateful, pointy, ninja rocks,
and that's not gonna happen again.
What have you been up to?
I think you already asked that.
Did you answer?
Didn't I?
I think I did.
I don't think you did.
Well, that's not like me.
Well, maybe you're nervous.
No, no.
Well, why don't we just say that if you did answer, we forgot
so we're asking again.
Oh, I have been working.
And I've been tending to my personal affairs.
Mia, I don't know if I mentioned.
One of my sisters as well, you know,
one of them is deceased,
and the other is
mentally retarded.
Panty raid.
When I say drink, you say now.
Drink.
Now.
Drink.
Now.
When I say drink, you say now.
Drink.
Now.
Drink.
Now.
Hey what are you guys doing?
We gotta go. The wedding starts in like 40 minutes.
We batted the time.
We lied to you cause we knew you'd be late.
So we lied to you about the time.
Yeah!
You don't need perfect people to make a perfect team.
You need people whose flaws feed into each other.
It's what do you call it?
Co-dependence.
Synergy.
For instance, there might be something Britta hates doing,
but Annie loves doing.
Or there might be something that Annie hates doing,
but she does it anyways,
because what she really loves is to feel useful.
You literally just defined co-dependence.
Here's to synergy.
Oh, look at you.
You little helper.
Okay,
do you Garrett take
Jack Nicholson to be your lawfully wedded wife?
I do.
I do, Johnny.
We invented a new game.
Celebrity Garrett Marriage.
Christian Slater to be your lawfully wedded wife.
I do.
I do.
Boo.
There's only Nicholson.
Yeah, well, listen to him.
We were genius to pad the time margin.
Because now we have, like, three more hours to play the game.
Okay. Do you, Garrett,
take Aubrey Plaza to be your wife?
I do.
I do.
Wait.
What do you mean, three more hours?
How is that even possible?
What, what time is the wedding?
Wait, what time is it now?
We're late.
We're late.
Gather everyone to the car.
What?
Yeah.
We'll drive together.
We are not driving together.
It's already been settled.
Nothing was settled.
What?
They left me home alone.
I'm home alone.
Well, not really.
What the hell you doing?
C'mon, let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Okay.
Geez.
Abed, you too.
Come on.
Oh, yeah.
We are here to witness the union of Garrett and Stacy
in the eyes of,
well in the eyes of whatever power you choose.
Personally, I find the notion of choosing
to be needlessly limited.
What if I'm capable of total contradiction?
What if science and religion were mine
to wield as I choose?
What if I'm God?
What if I'm God?
It is likely that I am not, but
I think it's totally out of line
to take that possibility off of the table.
Now, I understand that vows have been written.
Stacy, when I first saw you,
looking at you made me feel good.
Touching you, felt better
and knowing you made me realize that without you,
I, I am incomplete.
I know I look pretty complete.
Somebody over there laughed at that the wrong way.
You are my body and my soul.
You are my favorite video game.
Yes. Come on.
Guys, guys guys.
Everybody's looking at us.
Your SHH was louder than what I said.
Welcome!
Everyone back there, you're welcome.
Please join us.
Any of those people could be God.
Okay. Over there.
Yes.
Garrett, since we met
you have felt so familiar.
I love making sandwiches with you.
I love folding towels with you.
I love giving you your pain killers, at the end of the day.
Well that, those aren't really vows.
That's a list of things you love about me, yeah.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
Garrett, do you take Stacy to be your lawfully wedded wife.
I do.
Stacy, do you take Garrett
to be your lawfully wedded husband,
to have and to hold and to honor.
Yes I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. And Mrs. Garrett Lambert,
Garrett you may kiss Mrs. Garrett.
Where the party at?
Okay, let's endure this.
Are we nailing today, or what?
Who would have thought Barrett's wedding
would be the best day of our lives.
Definitely not Garrett, since his name's not Barrett.
Whoopsie. We say a wrong a name.
Racist.
Oh, no. You a racist.
That guy's a racist.
From here to there is racist.
Having a good time?
Oh, yes.
Are you Garrett's mom?
I sure am.
I think you guys could maybe take a step back,
gain a little perspective,
so you don't wreck the whole night
for some really wonderful people.
You came to a wedding in the middle of the vows through a bush.
I'm not Dr. Phil, but,
I don't want my son to kill himself,
so, do what you gotta do!
Yeah.
Holy crap.
What have we done?
Okay, we just got checked.
And it was pretty deserved.
But, we're not just gonna stand here and lick our wounds either.
Jeff is right.
And that chipper passive aggressive lady, she's right, too.
So, let's spread out and...
Be the best wedding guests, anyone has ever seen!
Yes.
Yeah.
I'm not gonna over think it, I'm just gonna try it.
Okay.
Yes. Yes.
Mazeltov.
So, a stranger walked over to our very proud group
and smashed our pride into pieces with a hammer,
which definitely felt like a disaster.
Then, I started to pick up the pieces of our pride,
and weirdly enough,
the first piece I picked up was my own pride, all of it.
It's almost like groups and people in groups,
can never be complete at the same time.
Does that make any sense?
No?
Well, that's your problem.
I love you, Abed.
Do I know how to be a good wedding guest?
Yes, I do.
A little too well, that's the problem.
My name is Elroy Patashnik,
and from 2006 to 2009,
I was addicted to encouraging white people.
All right!
Now there's a man who knows his meatballs.
Thank you.
It started as simple survival.
The tech industry in the 90s, this face, this voice,
they're either gonna help you or hold you back.
So, you tap the gas, because well, why tap the brake?
Oh, you know, you know what you're doing.
This man knows exactly what he's doing.
I learned the cheat code.
White people like encouragement.
It really doesn't matter what for.
Now, that's a container for liquid.
I never felt like a sellout.
I never laugh at anything unfunny, never said anything untrue.
The thing is, and this will sound racist,
white people are very discouraged,
and very discouraging to each other.
Sweetie, you, you're getting meatball juice
everywhere but your plate.
I think I'm going better than you are, with your asparagus.
Oh, now that's the way to handle meatballs.
And look at you.
Working that asparagus.
So, the day you start telling them,
hey, just do what you're doing!
I love you.
I love you.
You feel like a superhero.
But, what's the danger?
Why'd I stop?
You know, same as anything else that makes you feel good.
If you don't put a lid on it.
* Oh, look at these pants. *
* He should keep on wearing *
* keep on wearing his pants *
There's no lid.
Stacy has a 90 year old Meemaw here.
I pushed her around the dance floor.
I think she liked it.
No, that's Polly.
No, Great Aunt Polly is Garrett's side.
I haven't met her.
Oh my God, do you think she saw me pushing Meemaw,
and now she's wondering what's wrong with her?
I'll be right back.
Annie, the world will still need you
after you finish your cake.
Am I that bad?
We have the same dragon.
Eventually you will slay it,
or train it, or dissolve in its stomach.
Its name is Helping Others.
If I train it, can I give it a cooler name?
If you train it, you can do anything you want.
If you slay it, I don't know.
I guess you get a new dragon named Yourself.
And then you'd be Jeff Winger.
Yeah, that guy needs help!
What would you name your dragon?
I think we need a list of dragon names.
Yeah!
And then we need to get you away from Jeff.
Is what I wanted to say, but how is that my business?
You don't show these to people when you finish them?
No.
Okay, good.
So then why do you make them, again?
It relaxes me.
It's like knitting with less discipline.
Princess Firebreath.
Sir Pent.
Doctor Rachel Spinetail.
Holly Hotbreath.
Jimmy Talon.
Christian Scale.
I got into a bit of a celebrity pun barrel here.
Carson Scaley.
Jude Claw.
Ariana Puffington.
Are these your biggest ice cubes?
No, you're boisterous!
Where's my brother!?
I've gotta thing to say about my friend Garrett!
There has been a plot twist
in the story of our comeback as wedding guests.
Garrett's older brother Bones
has relapsed during his weekend pass
and will be unable to do the best man toast.
You got him?
So, I took Garrett's mom's side
and told her after our behavior today,
it was the least I could do for them.
And I'm not gonna Winger speech it,
this is a thing of substance.
We pooled all the inside info based on all the mingling,
and this toast is rocket fueled selflessness.
And this wedding is gonna regret the day
it thought we'd make it about us.
Because we're about to be the first guests
in history to out-toast the entire wedding party.
God, I love my job!
Wait, this isn't my job.
God, I love myself!
That was Stacy's
first time!
But it's not gonna be her last time, right Garrett?
So many classic toast errors.
A fire hydrant could follow this.
I love you so much, and please, keep painting.
Don't let Garrett, don't paint.
Don't let Garrett keep you from painting.
Okay, I'm done.
Okay, Stacy's friend Andi, everybody.
Next up we have a replacement best man,
Garrett's friend from Greendale College, Jeffrey Winger.
There's a lot of things I can say about this couple.
They're both in my class at Greendale,
and like all my students, I give them till about June.
No, you guys'll be fine forever,
as long as Stacy never lets Andi babysit.
Or go near a child.
Or be in the same town as a pair of scissors.
This girl's a wreck.
He's being too mean.
No, he's reading the room.
Andi was a bummer, they needed this.
Life's about two people merging their lives,
but that means
two families are leaving here tonight as one.
That's a big deal.
Now my friends and I came here tonight as outsiders,
but thanks to some good advice,
we spent the night learning about these two clans of outsiders.
We learned that Garrett's uncle Tony is a photographer.
But Uncle Tony,
did you know that Stacy's friend Lawrence makes and sells frames?
Yeah, look each other up, get some business going.
Oh, and Garrett's neighbor Dawn loves vintage cars.
Stacy's chiropractor Susan brought her dad,
and guess what?
Her dad worked in an automobile factory in the 60s.
Yeah, I know, these are the kind of things you learn
being the biggest jerks at a wedding.
Here's another golden nugget in the gravel.
Some of you have worked the dance floor
with Garrett's divine Great Aunt Polly,
90 years young.
And some of you chatted with Stacy's Meemaw,
also 90 years young.
Now, I don't know if they've even met before tonight,
but we did learn
that both of them were born in the same town.
Sheridan, Wyoming.
Now Garrett and Stacy,
would you mind getting them both out here?
All right. Yeah!
I know Aunt Polly's here.
Isn't she beautiful?
Okay. Who has got eyes on Meemaw?
This is Meemaw.
Oh, this is Meemaw!
Okay, I feel like an idiot.
I'm so, so sorry.
Garrett, where's Aunt Polly?
Okay.
I, now I don't feel as stupid
because either someone here is lying,
or this family's a lot closer than we thought.
And now, this is a man
that knows how to marry his cousin.
None of this would have happened
if I wasn't always trying to help.
Actually, none of this would have happened
if I hadn't tried helping you with your helpfulness.
Oh, don't torture yourself with that logic.
None of us would have met if Hitler hadn't been born.
Also none of Britta's arguments would have a default analogy.
Excuse me?
He's saying you go to the Hitler well a lot.
What are you, Hitler, Hitler?
Okay, Britta, we're all the worst right now,
take a day off.
I did.
Between us ruining the ceremony
and ruining the reception when we were all just individual people,
I wasn't the worst.
I'm only the worst with you guys.
Well, me too.
Me too.
I was a good dean before you guys.
You can't disprove it.
I relapsed because of you guys.
What?
Oh it's not a big deal.
White people problems.
I like this group.
I'm at my best when I'm with you guys.
Well, that clinches it.
Separate cabs.
Separate cabs.
Separate cabs.
For those still with us, we won't be cutting the cake or dancing.
And I believe there was a guy in a Homer Simpson costume
that was gonna surprise me.
That won't be necessary!
Drive safe, and thank you for coming.
What are you going to do?
Chang!
We're going home.
Are you gonna stay married?
Chang!
We consulted with a lawyer, and
it is legal in this state to marry your cousin.
But after talking to our family,
we feel an annulment is warranted.
What no, screw that.
Chang. No.
Chang, get back here.
Hey, screw you guys.
No, this family is so screwed up,
you thought you were two different families.
Now that you know you're not,
you can't wait to leave, and you want this guy to do what?
Forget he's in love?
For you?
You want him to take one for this crappy team?
Let him finish.
They were letting me finish, sir.
I know, I was being sarcastic.
Okay, you know?
Garrett, who loves you here more than Stacy?
Nobody.
Stacy, is it your fault Garrett's your cousin?
No.
Is anyone here going to make less fun of these two
or be better friends to them no matter what they do?
No.
No.
It's you against the world, and you will not win.
But, you get to make your moves.
Not them.
Stacy,
will you be my legally incestuous wife?
Yes.
Everyone stay and eat cake, or go to hell.
This is about me.
I didn't think I could do it, but I did.
Smile. Smile.
Garrett, look up.
So much Jimming.
Wow, what an episode of Community.
Hi, I'm Briggs Hatton credited author of this weeks episode.
You might have noticed an emphasis on the topic of incest,
well that's no accident.
For the past two years,
when not serving as writer's assistant on Community,
I've been researching incest on the internet.
What I found, surprised me.
Did you know that first cousins can have children
without great risk of birth defect or genetic disease?
That's a quote directly
from the New York Times, April 4, 2002.
But despite this scientific fact,
State Laws on incest remain inconsistent and woefully outdated.
I mean I, I can make love to my cousin in Nebraska,
but if I take her on a date in South Dakota,
I'm looking at 15 years prison time.
I told the Community writers,
attention must be paid.
They said they'd allow me to address it on one condition.
At the end of the episode,
I must appear and identify myself as a writer.
Look, I'm not trying to tell you how to feel about incest,
I'm just letting you know,
there's more to it than you've been told.
I'm Briggs Hatton,
and I wrote the Community Season Six, Incest Episode.
Good night.
Did you get any of that?
