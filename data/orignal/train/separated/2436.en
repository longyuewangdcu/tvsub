The spell the travelers cast across Mystic Falls
eliminates spirit magic,
The other side is collapsing,
and everyone in it is going away.
What about you? What happens?
Jeremy, I will be fine.
When the travelers die,
Liv will do the spell,
and her magic will allow
the people on the other side to push their way through.
Damon...
I know
Oh, my god. Alaric, what are you--
Come on. You got to go.
What about Damon?
You need to go home to your brother.
I'll find Damon.
I can't find Damon.
I'm not leaving without him!
I won't let you die for them.
Phasmatos fumas extas.
We need to start the spell again.
We can't. That was our one shot.
Damon's on the other side.
Elena, you can say good-bye.
Damon, finally had everything he wanted.
He was happy.
He should be here.
It was all a lie.
You told me you could come back.
I love you.
Bonnie, Bonnie, don't you dare.
Please don't leave me.
I love you, Elena.
Bye.
Bonnie...
Bonnie...
Do you think it will hurt?
I don't know.
What the hell was that?
I have no idea.
Go out there and check it out.
You go out there and check it out.
Hey, I got the lan--
Oh, my God. Sheriff Forbes.
I thought you were a serial killer.
Worse, actually,
because you'll still be alive when I call your parents.
Pack it up and strike it down.
I'm like, for real, sheriff Forbes?
You got nothing better to do
than to bust us for a couple of beer cans?
Tax money at work.
It could've been worse.
Melanie Peterson was arrested for underage drinking last week.
I swear this place is turning into that town from "Footloose."
Yeah, well, let's just get out of here.
Jessie?
Yo, Jessie.
Jessie.
Jessie.
Don't talk.
You'll be ok. I'll get help.
Look. Up.
Today was a good day.
Summer is official over
and I couldn't be more thrilled.
Sophomore year.
I guess this is the year you're supposed to pick a major
and start carving out your path in life.
So, that's what I did.
You are look at the future Dr. Elena Gilbert.
So. Pop quiz.
Mr. Weatherly complains of chest pain and shortness of breath.
Can anyone tell me what tests we run?
Gilbert.
A pulmonary angiogram provides a clear picture
of the blood flow in the arteries and the lungs,
which is what we look for in a pulmonary embolism,
a condition in which Mr. Weatherly's symptoms are common.
Good someone's read ahead.
Remember that. You'll need that in 3 years.
Here's the bed pan you need to know about today.
Moving on.
I was impressed.
Thanks.
OK, so, maybe I spent the day observing.
but at least now we have unlimited access to blood bank,
and trust me, we need all the help we can get.
Some of us are still getting the hang of the whole
drinking other people's blood thing.
Want some?
It's all right. I had some on the way over.
You know, this will never not be weird.
What? That some ancient witch turned me into a vampire
or that 4 months ago, I rose from the dead?
That you're my college professor.
In Alaric's defense,
he couldn't exactly compel himself a job back at the high school.
Nope, the high school, Grill, the town square--
Thanks to the travelers' anti-magic spell,
everything in Mystic Falls still off-limits to anyone with fangs.
A lot of us haven't been back home in months.
On the plus side, the crime rate is way down.
Although I'm not sure Matt got the memo.
Good move, Donovan. Proving once again
that self-defense is the best offense.
I will say he's never been better.
I think he can bench press more than Jeremy now,
which is beyond freaky.
Speaking of Jeremy...
Actually, let's not talk about my brother.
Let's talk about Stefan.
Last I heard, he was chasing some lead to some
witch that could contact the dead.
Get your ass in here, kid.
Payday.
We haven't spoken in months.
Which can only mean that his search
for answers to what happened has been all-consuming.
He's grieving. He lost so much.
We all did.
But we're all getting through it in our own way.
I dropped out of Whitmore.
Why would I support their stupid football team?
It's the opening game of the season, Caroline.
Time to come home.
I am home. I just signed the lease to my new apartment.
On the border of a town that doesn't want you.
That's not home. That's sad.
You don't even like football.
No, but I like drinking in the parking lot beforehand.
Caroline, you're coming.
Tyler, don't act like you have any ground to stand on.
You skipped an entire year.
And you hounded me for an entire year.
So, here I am. Now, get your ass back here.
Caroline, I'm picking you up at your house at 6 p.m. sharp tomorrow.
Ok? Bring your school spirit. Bye.
Anyway...
As I was saying.
I haven't exactly found a spell
that can undo an anti-magic border per se,
but this book mentions travelers,
which isn't that helpful,
but at least it's a step in the right direction.
Sweetheart.
Yeah?
You should go with them tomorrow.
No. We're gonna go see a movie.
We have spent the entire summer together.
God. You're sick of me.
Caroline, you just lost one of your best friends.
It makes sense that you want to hold on to what's familiar,
but Elena lost her, too,
and she clearly misses you.
No. Elena clearly has taken up residency on planet denial,
where football is more important than her boyfriend
being swept away into oblivion.
Do you know she's barely cried for him?
She was a full-on wreck over Bonnie for months,
but every time I mention Damon, it's like nothing ever happened.
Caroline, Elena has experienced more grief
than anyone I've ever met.
You should cut her some slack.
What? Someone trample over Mr. Davis's flower bed again?
Two kids were admitted to the hospital
with suspicious wounds on their necks.
Vampire attacks? How?
Vampires can't get into Mystic Falls.
No, but they can lurk around the borders.
I gotta cut lunch short.
That's it. I gotta take care of this. Listen.
Consider Elena's offer, ok?
Mystic Falls isn't going anywhere.
Hey, don't forget your basket.
She doesn't want to let go.
I get it.
I don't want to let go, either.
I don't want to think that everything's changed,
that I have to start over.
The worst thing that could possibly happen actually did.
But I don't have to.
Anyway, that was my day. How was yours?
Can we go back to the part
where Ric came back to life to be a college professor?
"Occult."
The word in its literal translation means "hidden."
Therefore, the study of the occult--
Therefore, the study of the occult
is the study of hidden knowledge.
Today, we're going to discuss it as it relates to resurrection.
Is there something funny, Liv?
More like ironic, but ok.
Oh, Mr. Lockwood.
How generous of the practice squad to lend you to us.
Sorry I'm late.
Typically, not all occult groups held a consensus on the topic.
Sorry, princess.
Just trying to check what page we're on.
I'm trying to listen.
...apostles, the Athanasian creeds Tertullian,
and the western church were inclined to believe
in resurrection of the flesh,
whereas the gnostics held the firm belief
that resurrection existed only in a spiritual sense.
Elena, you know I can smell that, right?
I'm teaching a class full of kids
who all look like blood sausages to me.
Now, put that away.
Sorry.
Uh, whereas others, like the early church fathers.
Luke.
Hey, I gotta run, actually.
Oh, no, I'll be quick. Really quick.
I just--I've been really thirsty lately.
Do you think it's because of the... you know.
Are you asking me if there are side effects
to the ancient psychotropic herbs I've been giving you,
becausere there haven't exactly been clinical trials.
Obviously.
I don't--I was just wondering if maybe you could, like, I don't know-
add something to the next batch?
Yeah, or maybe there shouldn't be a next batch.
What do you mean?
Luke, it was your idea that I see him again, remember?
You were all, "Hey, Elena, I'm sorry that I wronged you.
I'm sorry that I'm the reason your boyfriend is dead," Remember?
And I am. I'm sorry.
Something I made clear when I made Alaric's daytime bracelet,
because you asked.
Yeah, I know.
And when I went against
my coven rules to get these herbs,
because you asked.
Right.
But it's time to return to reality here.
Look, I'm fine.
I'm ok. I promise.
Just come by my place by 5, ok?
Elena.
Thank you.
Hey, Dean.
I think a zero might've fallen off my paycheck.
Oh, yeah. I had to dock you 200 bucks.
For what?
Dan Zimmer said you put a ding on the hood of his Shelby.
Dan's wife put a ding on the hood of his shelby.
That's funny.
Sounds like you're calling my best customer a liar.
You're ripping me off, Dean.
What you gonna do about it, kid?
You gonna quit?
Run off to wherever the hell you came from?
That's what I thought.
Hello?
Hey, just checkiing in
to see if your contact panned out yet.
Still working on it.
Good. Keep me posted. Let me know how it goes.
You already read all that?
Cover to cover, with no mention
on how to undo an anti-magic force-field.
And if I'm going to single-handedly take back our town,
I'm gonna need a little bit more to go on.
Got it. All right, well,
I brought "Ancient witchcraft, volume two."
I read it.
How about "The art of hexing" And "Elements of magic"?
Fine. Thank you.
So, how's Stefan?
He's ok.
How often do you talk to him?
I don't know. Couple times a week.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here, Caroline.
Is something bothering you?
He didn't say good-bye.
Damon and Bonnie died and he just left.
No phone calls, no e-mails,
Just disappeared into thin air.
And I haven't heard from him in months.
I actually convinced myself
that he was in some remote mountain region
and couldn't accept my calls.
Or maybe he just doesn't want to bother you
with every half-lead that goes nowhere.
Or maybe I just need to get over it.
Thanks for the books.
Why isn't Jeremy answering his phone?
I don't know. He's probably doing homework or something.
Doing homework?
Put me on speaker, please.
Jeremy, I know you can hear me.
Get your butt off that couch and do something productive.
Or what? You're gonna come here and make me?
Or I'll have the sheriff arrest you
and drag you to the town border,
where I will kick your ass myself.
Matt, a little help, please.
Yeah, I'll deal with him.
Thank you.
So. This is it, huh?
Video games. Random girls.
Drunk by noon every day.
Look, it sucks that Bonnie's dead, Jer.
I get it. But you need to start living your life again.
How? By joining the community protection squad?
What exactly are you protecting us from?
Bike theft? Litter?
Magic doesn't work here. The town's safe.
For now. But Caroline's working on a way to reverse all that.
So, it's only a matter of time before we're dealing with
all the problems that come along with vampires again.
You're a hunter. You have skills.
Use them.
No more magic means I'm not a hunter anymore.
Yeah, you're right, Jer.
You're not much of anything anymore.
Hey. You're home.
I thought you were coming over at 5.
I know you did. Look, Elena,
I can't help you anymore.
Is it because I told you that I was thirsty?
It's fine. I can get more at the blood bank at the clinic.
I work there. It's easy.
Elena, you're going through this stuff like crazy.
Yeah.
I'm not a drug pusher.
No, you're my friend.
My friend
in spite of the fact that my boyfriend got stuck on the other side.
Elena, don't.
Because you decided to stop the spell that could bring him back.
My friend that owes me.
No. A friend who cares about you
and thinks you're living in denial.
I know you have more.
Elena, stop.
Where is it?
Look at you.
Where is it?
I need to see Damon, Luke,
And I'm not asking.
I kind of want to set up Ric with Jo from the hospital.
I mean, we both know he has a soft spot for the sexy doctor type.
How long do you think it takes after
somebody comes back to life before they can start dating again?
Well, the fact that you can say that with a straight face
is one more reason that I love you.
So, like, 3 months?
Can I ask why there's not a Bennett witch in the back?
I mean, can't Luke whip up a batch of herbs in Bonnie flavor?
You know, if I had to drive around with everyone that I've lost,
I'd need a school bus.
Or you just know that Bonnie would agree with Luke.
The last thing you need to do
is conjure up someone who's gonna tell you the truth.
Can we not talk about this?
About what? The fact that I'm dead?
Cos I am.
Technically, you were dead when we met.
Good point. Now I'm just gone.
Damon, please don't say that.
And this conversation is pretty much the smart, level-headed you
talking to the irrational possible drug addict you.
Which is clear evidence of your insanity.
Yeah. Ok.
Oh! Watch it, dick.
Sorry.
Still working out the kinks of being human.
My tolerance blows.
Yeah, Tyler, not to play chaperone here,
but are you sure somebody with your anger issues
should be drinking at all this close to a full moon?
My issues are under control.
Coach lets me practice with the football team.
I get to kick ass in a controlled environment.
Till you get plastered and do something stupid
and trigger your werewolf curse all over again.
Alaric, chill. It's under control.
Good. But just in case.
Really?
You know, I haven't been buzzed since I came back to life.
And saying that aloud while sober really freaks me out.
As the only sober person here, trust me
when I tell you this, Tyler-- that girl is so not into you.
Thanks for the beer.
Your fridge makes me want to kill myself.
We're gonna have to split this.
Knock yourself out.
So. You want to grab dinner?
There's that crab shack on the harbor you want to check out.
Uh, yeah, I would,
but, um, I told Dean i'd stop by the garage later.
Yeah, never heard that one before.
Hey, look, no offense, Ivy, but, uh,
you're the one who showed up to me today.
Hey, I'm not asking for your hand in marriage.
Stefan, come on.
We've been hanging out for two months now.
I don't know anything about you or your family.
Your friends you never talk about call you
and you get all weird.
I get weird?
Yeah. You get weird.
So, we'll play a game.
You tell me one thing about you
and I'll tell you one thing about me.
Well, I already know everything about you.
You're from Colorado. You love dogs.
Your dad's a bit of a pain in the ass,
but you graciously let him pay your rent.
Ok. Fine. Your turn.
Now tell me something I don't know about you.
I'm a vampire.
You're so annoying.
And I like you.
Thank God. Someone over 20.
The rest of the chaperones are huddled around the burger bar.
And you're a vegetarian.
I don't eat red meat. I look at blood all day.
Because I work at the medical center.
Not because I'm a serial killer or anything.
Right.
I'm jo.
Alaric. I teach occult studies here.
I didn't know that was an actual thing.
Yeah.
Not that it's not a thing.
May I?
Uh, you know, actually, I'm a germaphobe.
A germaphobe.
Yeah.
So, you're like a vegetarian of cool people.
Yeah. Exactly.
Um...will you excuse me a second?
I actually have to make a--
A quick phone call.
Ok, so, when I lost my human nature,
I also lost my game.
Where are you?
What are you looking for?
I thought I had-- guess not.
What's this?
Are you ok?
Depends. Am I still in the western hemisphere?
Hang on. I can help.
I'm sorry. I'm from New York
and we're big on cell phone reception.
Where you heading?
Mystic Falls.
My GPS died and then I started second-guessing myself--aah!
Easy. This is when you wipe her slate and let her go.
I am still hungry.
You're gonna kill her,
just like you nearly killed the last one
and the one before that and the one before that.
I got it, Damon. I'm gonna let her go.
I'm just--I just need a little more.
Oh, my god!
What are you--
Caroline. It's not--
No!
Help. Help, anybody.
What did you do?
Why the hell are you feeding on people?
It's fine. I've compelled everyone else.
Whoa, hang on. So, you're the border lurker?
The what?
Did you know my mom's been out looking for a vampire prowler?
It's gotta be the herbs Luke's been giving me.
They make me so thirsty.
Maybe I'm not thinking straight.
Whoa. What herbs?
They make me see Damon.
I can talk to him and--and-- and I can be with him and--
Is this what you've been doing this whole time?
Hallucinating your dead boyfriend?
I tried to grieve him, Caroline.
Trust me. I know grief.
I've got grieving down to a science at this point,
and I tried.
But every time...
I let it sink in that
I'm never gonna see him again...
I feel like I'm gonna die.
Look, hon, I get it. OK? I do.
But...there are better ways to get through this.
Like what?
Like dropping out of school and
having picnics with my mom near the town border?
Or maybe I could pull a Stefan
and just bounce from country to country chasing some false hope
that we're gonna find a way to bring Damon and Bonnie back.
We're all getting through it.
This is me getting through it. OK?
Yeah, but you're not getting through it, Elena.
You're just pressing pause.
Look. I'll call my mom and she can fix all this.
But you need to get out of here
and go hide, OK?
So, just...go.
What am I doing?
Help me.
Please help me.
You're OK.
It's OK.
You have to help me.
There was this girl. I saw her.
She looked so normal but I swear to God,
she had these teeth and she bit me.
You have to help me...- What the hell is going on here?
You need to find her.
What happened?
There was this girl and I was--I was lost--
She hit a dog.
It bit her. She was lost.
She stopped to ask this girl for directions.
She had a dog and it bit her.
Is that what happened?
Look at me.
Matt. What's going on here?
This girl was attacked.
I'm not sure we're getting the full story.
Matt, get her to the hospital now.
No...You're not listening.
What are you doing? You need to talk to her.
We'll get a statement as soon as she's been treated.
You didn't even ask her what happened.
All due respect, Tripp,
you run a volunteer community program.
I'm the sheriff. Let me do my job.
Go!
两通未接电话
Hello?
Stefan, is that you?
I know it's been a really long time since we talked, but--
Elena, hey.
What's going on?
I need you to tell me that you found something.
A witch. A guy who knows a witch
who knows something. Anything.
I need you to give me hope and tell me
that you're gonna find Damon and bring him back.
Not yet.
But how do you do it?
How do you wake up in the morning?
How do you go about your day without falling apart?
Tell me what you're doing to get through this,
because I'm clearly doing it wrong.
There's no right or wrong way, Elena.
No, there's only forever.
That's why I need you to give me hope.
Because I don't think I can live forever without him.
I can't. I gave up.
You just said that you were looking for him.
I did.
And then I realized it was pointless
and that I needed to move on with my life,
So...I stopped.
What do you mean you stopped?
I mean I said good-bye, Elena.
I moved on. Damon is gone.
It's time for you to say good-bye, too.
No.
Where are you?
The game's gonna start in, like, 15 minutes.
Do you know Elena has some witchy drug problem?
Yeah, Luke Parker has been feeding her some concoction
that allows her to hallucinate Damon.
Whoa. Slow down. What?
It gets her all bloodlusty and confused.
She nearly killed a girl today.
This makes no sense.
Yeah, well, neither did the fact that
she got over Damon so quickly when he died.
Now it's crystal clear. She hasn't.
She's living in a fantasy land.
Is she ok?
She's a mess. And as long as Luke keeps playing witch doctor,
She's not going to get any better.
Let me deal with him.
We're just meeting up with my friend here.
神秘瀑布镇
Everything will be fine.
Sarah, stop, please.
Get back in the car. Stop! Sarah!
Hey! I'm not gonna hurt you.
You kidnapped me.
Look, I know you're scared,
and I'm sorry that this happened to you,
but all I can do is promise that it won't happen again.
Why the hell should I trust you?
Because I've been attacked like that more times than I can count.
I've had my throat ripped open.
I've had my neck snapped, my hand smashed.
I've drowned. I've died and come back to life.
And I've lost what little family I had,
and I refuse to lose anyone else.
I want to protect people like you.
Like us.
That's...quite a story, but...
Thing is, I don't trust anyone. Ever.
That's probably wise.
Hey. Have you seen Elena?
She's not coming.
Apparently, she's not in her right mind.
What happened?
Is this what you've been up to all summer?
Messing with Elena's brain?
Does it help with the guilt
or are you just desperate for friends?
Where's Elena now?
Why? So you can trick her into thinking Damon's alive?
Who does that? She almost killed someone.
You're drunk.
Don't touch me.
Where's your magic now, Parker?
What's wrong? You can't chant?
You stay away from Elena,
Or you're gonna have a problem your magic wand can't fix.
Hey! Knock it off.
Knock it off.
You got it under control, huh?
You want to tell me what that was about?
Come on. Let's get out of here.
You can't be here.
You're not even real.
It's just my subconscious making me see what I want to see.
One call from my brother and you're gonna throw all this away?
You know I want to see you, Damon.
But it makes me reckless. I hurt people.
So, why am I here?
Do you want to move on?
Move on.
I never got to say thank you.
For what?
For saving Stefan
and... for bringing back Alaric and Tyler.
Thank you.
Elena --
No, I'm not done yet. I --
I want to thank you for giving me everything I always wanted.
A love that consumed me. And passion.
Adventure.
There's nothing more I could ever want
other than for it to last forever, but...
it can't.
This is the last time I'm gonna see you.
This is good-bye, Damon.
I love you.
I have to let go.
You're still holding on.
I -- No, I...
I said good-bye, Damon.
I don't blame you.
You know what's waiting for you.
How long before you go running back to Luke?
No. I told you. That was the last time, Damon.
I-I'm done.
An eternity of torment, agony, and grief, and you feel it all.
Stop it, Damon. Stop it, stop it.
You're getting in my head.
Don't do this. Please.
You'll feel it forever.
No!
Could you be more of a douchebag cliche?
I got a little out of control. I know.
A little? It's not Luke's fault that your friend's
emotionally blackmailing him to fulfill whatever mental head case crap
she's going through.
Grief. It's called grief.
Your brother got to live that day, remember?
The rest of us lost people because of him.
I'm aware of that, Tyler.
I think about it every day.
So does Luke.
A lot of you got your lives back, too,
because of me.
So, at the very least, do me a favor
and lay off my brother.
You're right. I'm sorry.
Yeah. Our twin powers don't work like that.
You actually have to tell Luke to his face.
Well, I will. Listen.
Liv, 4 months ago, I could do anything.
I could make anyone do anything that I wanted.
I was stronger than most people on this earth.
And then it went away.
And all that's left inside of me is rage.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I want you to understand that I am trying to deal with it.
Ok, good. Good luck dealing with it.
Why do you do that?
I'm trying to talk to you
and you just give me that look and walk away?
What would you like me to do, Tyler?
It's Stefan. Leave a message.
Hey. It's me.
Just leaving another message about
how today was not a good day.
Everyone drifted apart.
It's like
everyone's pretending they can get through this alone.
Elena's gone.
And I think she's so scared to accept what happened
that she's become a completely different person.
And if you ask me, Tyler's just hiding at Whitmore,
pretending everything's fine
as if he can outrun his werewolf gene or something.
Matt and Jeremy never leave Mystic Falls anymore.
There's an invisible wall standing between us and them
and nobody's doing anything about it.
Part of me wonders if they hope we never find a way back in.
And then there's me,
just sitting in a diner on the border of town
looking for a way to get our home back.
We just lost two of our closest friends.
We need each other. We need to be together, Stefan,
or pretty soon we're just gonna end up
pictures in a yearbook in a drawer somewhere,
and so, that is why I am not going to stop calling you
until you pick up the phone and I hear your voice
and you tell me that you are going to help me fix it.
Because I'm not going to give up on us.
语音信息及未接来电
Do you like being a vampire?
Why don't you get some sleep?
We'll talk about it tomorrow
when that crap's out of your system.
Because with all the funerals
and the start of the year...
we never really talked about how you're dealing with all this.
You mean with me coming back to life?
Well, moving away from Mystic Falls helped.
And since my ex-girlfriend is
happily married to a pediatrician up in Alaska,
I didn't have any awkward reunions to handle.
I meant the blood lust.
The heightened emotions and immortality.
Honestly, Elena...
I hate everything about being a vampire.
Me, too.
At least I did.
Then one day, I discovered the good part.
You know... the promise that love could be eternal.
And I had that with Damon.
which means for the rest of eternity,
I'm gonna have a hole in my heart where
he's supposed to be.
Trust me. It gets easier.
I know how death works, Ric.
Trust me. I have done it. A lot.
There's no such thing as moving on.
It's a lie.
So, if I'm ever going to be able to fall in love again,
and make eternity bearable,
I need you to do something.
What?
You were created by the original vampire spell,
which means you can compel other vampires.
And since I can't take away my vampirism,
I want you to take away Damon.
I want you to compel me to forget that
I ever loved him.
Every day I tell you I hate that.
And every day I do it.
