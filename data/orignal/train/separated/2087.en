Aloha, football fans,
and welcome the grudge match.
The inter-island rivalry everyone's been waiting for:
the Kukui Kings versus the P-Boy's Scorpion.
Oh! How'd you miss that facemask call, ref?!
He only tried to gouge the kid's eyes out! You suck!
I'm glad she's on our team.
No, she's just getting warmed up.
Sorry we're late.
Nice hands, brah.
Hey, Gracie. I'm Steve.
It's great to meet you finally.
Your dad, he talks about you all the time.
Talks about you a lot, too.
Really?
We, uh, we commiserate. It's a father-daughter thing.
Hi, I'm Kono.
Hello.
And I'm Uncle Chin.
Are you a football player?
I used to be.
I used to play quarterback for that red team.
He was a legend, too, till, uh, till I came along
and shattered all his records.
That's a really pretty tennis outfit.
Yeah, I had to pick her up today at a country club.
Step-Stan decided that she should
start taking tennis lessons.
What's wrong with tennis, Danny?
I'll tell you what's wrong with tennis.
It can be played on a table,
which makes it an activity, not a sport.
You throw the ball, I catch the ball, that is a sport.
It's my duty as a father
to teach my daughter the difference.
Dad, I can still hear you.
Well, you're not supposed to be listening to me, huh?
You're supposed to be paying attention,
'cause it's football. It's a sport.
Dad, I'm hungry.
How can you be hungry? We ate an hour ago.
We didn't eat nachos an hour ago.
What was I thinking about? Of course, we didn't.
Come on. Let's go.
Hey, get me some.
Bye.
I mean, is this place great or what, huh?
It's a real ballpark here.
Remember Yankee Stadium?
Popcorn, we got corndogs.
They don't have that kind of food at country clubs, do they?
Well, they have hot dogs,
but they don't come on a stick.
No stick? Defeats the whole purpose.
Come here. Come on.
Excuse me. I'm a police officer.
Yes?
We may have a situation here.
This is my daughter Grace. I need you
to take her and your daughter into the bathroom
and wait there until I get back, all right?
Okay.
Thank you. Hey, come on, kid, listen to me.
This nice lady's gonna watch you for a little bit.
I want you to go with her, okay?
Daddy...
Hey, I'm just gonna go make sure
there's no bad guys, that's all-- all right?
I'll be right back. Come here. I love you. Go on.
Okay, come on.
Where are my nachos?
Hey, I'm right in front of you.
Got two guys headed to the field, strapped.
I think something's about to go down.
We got trouble.
Kono, call HPD for backup.
Hey, all right. Come on, Junior.
Gun! Gun!
Put it down! Put it down!
Get out of the way!
Black shirt! Runner!
I got him.
Hands behind your head right now-- right now!
Got him. Got him. Go! Go get Grace!
All right, everybody, keep the peace and stay calm.
Grace!
Grace!
Daddy! Daddy!
Come here, baby.
Come here.
You okay, huh?
You okay?
Freeze!
Put your hands where I can see 'em!
Turn around slowly.
Sid?
There's no ID on this victim.
See if any of the other witnesses know him.
You're a hell of a quarterback. What's your name?
Junior Satelli.
Junior, all right, you got lucky today.
It's just a scratch.
Hey, boss, over here.
You're gonna be all right, kid.
Excuse me.
This is one of the shooters.
Do you recognize the art?
It's a 14K tattoo. This guy's a Triad enforcer.
The other vic is Samoan.
These guys are from two different gangs.
So what are we looking at here, a gang war?
The Triads and Samoans have coexisted on this island
for as long as I can remember. They never brought
their wars into the public,
especially in front of their families.
You guys okay?
Yeah, okay. You?
Yeah. I lost my runner in the parking lot.
That is the most ridiculous thing
I have ever heard in my life.
Violence follows me? I mean,
how do you even come up with something like that?
No, what happened here has nothing to do with my job.
In fact, it is just the opposite, okay?
She is safe because I am a cop.
Huh? You know, I can't,
I can't even do this right now.
She'll be there in five minutes.
An officer's bringing her home.
Yeah. Good-bye.
Can't wait to meet your ex.
Yeah, the two of you can plan my demise.
So what do we got?
Six friendlies wounded, two hostiles dead.
Think it was a gang shooting.
Triads and Samoans.
Well, if this is a gang war,
the problem is there's only gonna be one winner.
Yeah. And the losers: whoever gets in the way.
What do you want?
Where's Sid?
I haven't seen him in months.
She has your eyes.
I gotta go.
All right.
Well, if you see him, tell him I'm looking for him.
So I got an ID on the target of our gang shooting.
His name is Manu Sapolu.
HPD says he's a high-ranking lieutenant.
If this is a gang war, Sapolu might be retaliation.
Crime Reduction Unit says the Samoans are responsible
for murders of at least seven Triads in the last six months.
That's why this was so public.
The Triads are sending a message they're not gonna sit back
and get taken out one-by-one.
Hey, guys! I got something.
Been going through the cameras left behind,
trying to ID the shooters--
this is what I saw.
Wait, wait, wait. Go back. Rewind that.
Check it out.
That's Junior Satelli, the quarterback.
So wait a minute-- everyone's running
away from the gunshots, but this kid Junior's
moving right towards it.
Thought you might find that interesting,
so I asked around.
Junior's uncle is Manu Sapolu,
Our dead Samoan.
Yeah, so he's probably in the gang.
And knows who the shooters are.
EMTs released him.
I saw him heading to the locker room.
Come on.
You know, when I was a kid,
this island seemed like the safest place on Earth.
That's the great thing about being a kid,
you don't know any better.
You could leave your door unlocked, no one would bother you.
If people had a beef, they'd settle it
with their fists, not with guns.
Back home, you win a fistfight,
you go home and you lock the doors twice,
'cause you know somebody's coming back with a gun.
Yeah.
I think maybe Hawaii's just catching up to the times.
Maybe.
Hey, there's Junior.
What do you think's in the bag?
I don't know. I'll give you three-to-one
it ain't his lunch.
Hey! Junior.
How's it?
Let's take a look at your lunch.
Hey, hey, I didn't do nothing.
You didn't do anything yet.
We know Manu Sapolu's your uncle.
What do you got?
Look at that.
What are you thinking, huh?
What are you thinking about?
It's all my fault, man.
I asked him to come watch me play today,
and if I wouldn't have done it, he...
You were starting quarterback
in the biggest game of the year.
You think your uncle was gonna stay away?
You lost someone you love today, I get that.
But putting another body in the morgue,
you think that's gonna make you feel better?
Junior, tell us where we can find the men who shot your uncle.
I promise you we'll take 'em off the street.
International Marketplace.
The guys that did this...
they just started using the store trains to front their meth business.
All right.
If I see you anywhere but a football field,
I will arrest you.
You understand?
Yes.
Go home.
Excuse me?
Go.
Hold on, hold on. Wait, whoa-whoa-whoa.
Go.
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Okay, let me ask you a question.
What the hell is the matter with you, huh?!
He's just a kid.
No, he's not just a kid.
He's a kid with a gun, okay?
What, did you want me?
To book him, Danno?
You think that's funny?
Let me break it down for you, okay?
Kids with guns kill innocent people and cops!
Right.
All right, now, that kid,
maybe he's going to finish a math assignment,
but more likely he's looking for another gun
so he can shoot someone!
Why? 'Cause you conveniently just decided
to forget about the law!
He's angry because somebody came along
and killed a member of his family today.
And he feels like if he doesn't do something about it,
nobody will.
So let's prove him wrong.
Come on, we got a job to do.
There's something wrong with you, you know that, right?
So you like to kill people on football fields, huh?
You're under arrest for the murder of Manu Sapolu.
That's because these girls are like, "Give us some money."
Go ahead, take the girls back to the house.
What the hell are you doing here?
There's a tape of the game.
It's only a matter of time
before you're I.D.'d and arrested.
What are you talking about, cuz?
You were the one pointing the gun.
Listen to me. You need to come with me right now
and talk to my people.
Your people?
You mean the drug dealers you ripped off when you were a cop.
Stay away from me.
What the hell are you doing?!
I'm a cop again.
I was trying to cut you a break.
I was trying to do things a different way.
I guess I was wrong.
Come on!
In here.
Give me a break!
Have a seat!
What's going on?
This is Sid. He was at the football game today.
He's a part of the Samoan gang.
Kono? Don't tell me you're working with them?
How do you know him?
He's our cousin.
He's our cousin.
I'm also a cop.
You're a cop?
Undercover.
Chin said you quit the HPD.
That would have been the easy way out.
Before I took this assignment, I had the whole department
coming down on me just because I shared blood with this thief.
Watch your mouth.
All right, just got off the phone with HPD.
His story checks out.
He's working with the gang unit.
They got him undercover with the Samoans.
That's what I was trying to tell you.
The police department said that I quit to set up my cover.
I've been under with the Samoan gangs for 11 months.
Trying to identify the major players
and collect enough evidence
to take them down on Federal warrants.
What can you tell us about this gang war?
I ain't saying another word in front of this dirty cop.
You want to believe I took money from drug raids, that's fine.
But you're going to tell us what you know.
I'll tell these two.
I ain't talking to you.
You saw Sid at the football game, didn't you?
And you let him go.
He wasn't involved in the shooting.
He was trying to get away.
You give him a pass because he's family.
They didn't do that for you.
Been working my way up.
They're starting to trust me.
For the past six months,
I was muscle for their call girl operations.
And finally starting to get in some of their security work.
From what I've been able to put together,
this beef with the Triads was instigated by the Samoans.
Why?
No idea.
But from what I been hearing,
it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better.
We're in the business of making things better,
so why don't you tell us where to start.
There's a repair shop over on Lagoon
Samoans sometimes use for deliveries.
Been a lot of activity over there lately.
Not sure what... but I heard it something to do
with muscling the Triads out of one of the rackets.
If you're looking for answers--
I'd start there.
So this is where Sid thinks the Samoans are doing business.
What kind of business? I'd say chop shop,
but I can't see anyone stealing and stripping these hoopties.
You know, I was thinking about it.
I think you should send Chin home for a couple days.
Law enforcement is Chin's family business,
so when he lost his badge, he lost his family.
If he wants to wear a badge,
he has to be able to deal with things like this.
You weren't held when you were a baby, were you?
It's called tough love, partner.
Oh, and by the way, I was held.
Okay? I have photos, if you want proof.
Photoshop.
So you say something?
No.
Have to give the Samoans props.
Sure can pack away the pies.
Right?
That's a lot of pizza.
Maybe not.
Look at this.
What do you see?
I don't see anything.
Exactly.
No cheese drips, no grease stains.
Nothing. No crust.
Doesn't that seem strange to you?
Not half as strange as it must to a man who lives on take-out.
What do they deliver in these boxes is what I'm saying.
Okay, all right, what's that look?
What look?
The look-- the look you give me
when you don't tell me what you're thinking about.
Next thing I know, I'm getting shot at.
Looking for iodine. Iodine.
Iodine.
Look at that, mystery solved.
Grab one of those boxes, put it on this table here.
Right here?
Yeah.
Okay, enough already. What are we doing here?
When iodine mixes with metal, it forms binary salts.
Binary salts-- all right.
Is there a reason for this chemistry lesson?
Pay attention. You might learn something.
Any metallic objects
that were left in those boxes...
...will have left trace elements behind.
The iodine will bring it out in a couple of seconds.
Wow.
Thick crust, extra bullets, please.
Yeah.
Come on, I can use a good slice. Let's go.
You know what? This place actually sounds all right.
I'm sure it does.
It says here they fly in the water.
That's great. Yeah.
This town could use a good slice.
It's a shame we got to put them out of business.
You should try Iolani's in Waikiki.
They do the best ham and pineapple on the Island...
Oh! Oh!
What?
Let me explain something to you, okay?
Pizza is mozz, sauce and dough.
That is it.
All right, you want to put a pepperoni on your slice
that's fine, but ham, out.
Fruit, out.
Okay, I don't care where we are. Pizza and pineapple
do not belong in the same airspace.
I guess you feel quite strongly about this.
That's cute. Did your ex get a new one, too?
No, it's... miserable attorney.
Yes, Lord Vader.
Is that a joke?
Yeah, over my dead body.
Let me explain to you why.
She is my daughter too, okay?
I don't care.
Hey, hey! Listen to me!
You scumbag.
You low-life, miserable, money-suck--
Hello? Hello?!
Okay. What up?
Rachel is trying to take me back to court over visitation,
because she says that it is not safe for Grace to be around me.
Like the football shooting was my fault.
Aw, man...
I'm sorry.
Hey, you the owner?
Pie or slice, officers?
We want to ask you a couple questions.
You mind turning that off?
I got money on this fight.
Okay. I got it.
You have no idea where you are, do you?
Well, we know we're not in New York, huh?
From your accent I'd say Jersey-- West Orange?
Bingo. You, too?
Yeah.
You're a long way from home.
Yeah, don't remind me.
You've been making deliveries to Kamomi Auto Shop?
Yeah. I make a lot of deliveries to a lot of places.
I'll bet you do.
This one was a special order.
Look, I just deliver the pizzas, man, you know?
What people choose to put in the boxes afterwards,
that's up to them.
Now if you gentlemen have any more questions...
speak to my lawyer.
Hey, I tried.
I thought you were very reasonable.
Your turn.
You guys have been watching too many gangster movies.
How do you figure?
This whole death march routine.
Like I'm supposed to believe a couple of cops
are going to cap me and dump me in the ocean.
Please.
We're not going to shoot you, Joey.
Whoo, that's a load off.
Hey, Joey, you got an 'aumakua?
What'd you call me?
An 'aumakua.
No, what's an 'aum... what's that?
Some Hawaiians believe that the spirits of their ancestors
appear in other living forms.
Oh, for instance, like a shark.
Right?
And that those animals, those specific animals,
will be there to protect them in times of need.
Looks like you could use
one of those 'aumakuas right about now, Joey.
Hey... What the hell, man?
Those dolphins? Huh?
Hey, hey.
Tell me those are dolphins!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Are those sharks?
No! No!
Come on, Joey.
Get me out of here!
You let us know when you're ready to talk, Joey.
Don't leave me!
Help! Hey!
Don't leave me here! Hey!
Hey... Wait!
Get me out of here!
Let me ask you a question.
Are you literally insane?
Oh, relax.
It's a cage for tourists.
They're... they're homeless Galapagos sharks.
They're not man-eaters.
Joey doesn't know that, though.
Hey, you want a beer? Yeah.
To, uh... to Joey.
Help!
Hey, what are you going to do about your ex, man?
I have no idea.
Gracie's my life.
If I lose her, I got no reason to be here.
I'd be alone on this island.
Hey! Wait!
Well, you still got Joey.
Yeah.
Hey! Hey!
We should go get him.
All right, all right.
Just get me out of here!
Okay. All right.
Why are you running guns to the Samoans?
I got business with them.
I know you got business with 'em-- what kind of business?
Samoans are helping us squeeze the Triads
out of their gambling operations.
We got the guns and money.
The Samoans got the muscle and the local what's-what.
And that's all I know. I swear. Please!
Who's "we"?
Who are you working for?
Salvo.
Frank Salvo?
Yeah! Yeah! He's coming to town tomorrow.
Why?
Because the guy he brokered the deal with got clipped.
You know, the guy who got shot at the football game.
Salvo wants to see the operation
and sit down with the new boss of the Samoan gang
and make sure everything's straight.
Joey, hold up a second.
Who's Salvo?
Frank Salvo is the head
of the Salvo crime family back in Jersey.
If he's the one pulling the strings,
the real war hasn't even begun yet.
Frank Salvo.
Suspected of a half dozen kills.
Three years ago, he put a bullet
in his uncle to take over the family.
His crews do it all.
Okay? They got prostitution, loan-sharking, protection,
drugs-- you name it.
The only racket they don't have is illegal gambling
'cause Atlantic City gets all the action.
That's why he's setting up shop out here.
Of course. Honolulu just shot down legalized gambling again.
Salvo knows this is an island of opportunity.
He takes over illegal gambling,
does things his way.
Let me tell you, he will spread like a virus.
Okay, and since the New Jersey Mob doesn't like partners,
it's only a matter of time before they cut out the Samoans.
Once that happens, every street from Mauka to Makai
will be as bloody as that football field.
Well, we have to eliminate the virus.
How?
According to Joey, Salvo is here for a sit-down
with the new head of the Samoan gang.
This guy-- Tuinei. Manu Sapolu's underboss.
Right.
Tomorrow night is Tuinei's big audition
to see if he can run these casinos.
We need to be on the inside,
getting Salvo on tape, spelling out the punch.
Okay, how are we going to do that?
What do you need, cuz?
Said it was urgent.
There's a rolling casino tonight.
Can you get us in?
I said I was working security detail for something.
Then, will you do it?
Putting me in a tough spot, kid.
This thing goes south,
I risk compromising my investigation.
I wouldn't be asking you to do this if I didn't think that
we had a real shot at ending this gang war.
I'll help you, but I don't want anything to do with Chin Ho.
That's cold, brah.
That is still family.
You think I want to feel this way?
We were boys, me and Chin.
I thought I knew him.
You do know him.
I know that what he did set me back with HPD.
I know if I'm not the one volunteering for the hardest jobs
-the ones that nobody will take--
they're going to think I'm dirty, too.
You think I like living in a tenement?
Away from my wife and baby almost a year.
That's what being related to Chin Ho did for me.
Do you ever think for a second
that maybe he didn't do anything?
That maybe he was set up?
All that matters is what the bosses think,
and they took his badge away.
To think anything else is career suicide.
He protected you at the football field,
and this is how you pay him back.
He thought I was a gangbanger, and he let me go.
What kind of cop does that?
The kind that knows how to look after his family.
I worry about you, Kono.
You know those HPD guys,
the ones that you depend on for back up?
You think they don't know who your cousin is?
They're wrong about him, and so are you.
He's a good man.
Listen, kid.
If you want my help, you got it.
But not Chin. End of story.
He's not going undercover.
Everyone knows him on the island.
It's just me, McGarrett and Danny.
I can probably get you in if you don't mind serving drinks.
I don't know about the two haoles.
They clean up nice.
They can go as whales.
Trust me.
Detour.
I beg of you. I beg of you.
What are you doing? Turn around! Turn around!
I'm in.
Copy that.
I have house security online.
Aloha, gentlemen.
Name?
Edwards.
They're good to go.
Let them in.
That guy's all yours.
Very large.
We're in.
Gotcha.
And you're loud and clear.
Vaveni and soda, please.
What do I look like?
Try one of the ladies holding drinks.
Yeah, good idea, right?
How come I look like a waiter,
you look like James Bond?
I don't know.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Clearly.
Mind if we join you?
Ten to start.
Gentlemen, Salvo's on his way in
with Tuinei, new Samoan boss.
Shall we?
What do you think?
Think he's got an ace.
Such serious men.
How about a...
drink before business?
Whiskey, straight up.
Beer in the bottle.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Enjoy. Hope you like it.
Got to come out here more often.
All right, look. Now that Sapolu's gone,
my friends on the mainland are a little concerned
that you could do everything that Manu said you could.
We can, and we will.
We're more motivated than ever
to take out the Triads.
That's what I'm afraid of.
We're not shipping out all this firepower
and cash for you to finance
some never-ending gang war.
You're getting paid
to get the Triads out of the gambling business
so that we can go on with our operation uncontested.
That's it.
Then your money is being well spent.
You've seen for yourself.
The rooms are up and running.
What's going on?
These two names-- I have to take...
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I cleared them. They're good to go.
The boss wants to see it.
Guys, I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
I need to know from you that you and your people
are going to protect my investment.
What is this?
I think you need to see this.
You know what to do.
Something wrong?
How is it that you people
have been fumbling around
on this moss-covered rock for generations,
and in two seconds, my men
find two names on that list
that don't check out?
We've been made.
Get Sid in here. He's running the gate.
I want to see him right now.
My men are handling Sid.
You just find the two men that he let in here.
Where did they take Sid?
Salvo's got him by the pool.
He's in trouble.
I'm coming in with backup now.
Can I help you? Invitation only.
Tell me what I want to know,
I make it fast and painless.
That's very considerate of you.
It is when you consider the other option.
Which is I put one in your gut and I watch you bleed out.
Because that's exactly what's gonna happen
if you don't start talking.
Now, who are those two guys you let in here?
And are you a cop?
Get them the hell out of here!
No, we can't-- Oh, oh, hey.
Guys, I'm really sorry. We don't want any trouble.
Use the gun!
Rachel, just hear me out.
All right, before you sic your lawyers on me
and try to take Grace away from me,
I want to remind you of something.
I moved 5,000 miles
so that I could see Grace twice a week.
Twice a week, okay?
That is 48 hours, 52 times a year,
for a grand total of 2,500 hours.
When you factor in sleep and school,
I can really only count on about
400 hours of real face time each year.
And then, you know, that's only gonna shrink
when she starts making friends
and then she goes off to college.
So, ultimately, that does not leave me with a lot of time
to spend with my daughter.
Not as much as I would want.
But I never complained.
I never complained,
because every single one of those minutes
reminds me of what I am doing and why I am here.
That little girl is my life.
So I am asking you, I am begging you, Rachel,
to please, please, just be kind...
and don't take her away from me.
That's all.
I will get Miss Rachel, sir.
Detective Williams, this is Rachel's counsel.
Yeah, will you put Rachel on, please?
That won't be necessary.
Don't tell me what's necessary, just do what I tell you to do.
Rachel's dropping the petition.
She's what?
She's decided not to fight you for visitation.
Daddy!
Come here, monkey.
God!
Guess what? I think I know what I want for my birthday.
Tell me.
A football-- a squishy pink one.
A squishy pink one?
That's the second best news I've heard all day.
So, uh, HPD is rolling out
the red carpet for Sid.
What do you mean?
Well, he goes undercover for a year,
basically ends the gang war.
Now he helps us get Salvo.
That guy's a hero now.
So are he and Chin cool then?
I don't know if I'd say "Cool,"
more like defrosting, you know.
It's gonna take time.
It's a hell of a grudge to hang onto, man.
Chin saved that guy's life.
Yeah, that reminds me,
did you, uh, speak to the governor
about my custody issue?
Governor doesn't discuss her business with me.
I might have heard something about Step-Stan building
a new hotel, though, and, uh,
you need government approval for that.
Thank you.
Let me ask you something.
How far deep did you have to dig?
I mean, how much of your soul
did you just lose by actually appreciating me?
Uh, I'm measuring.
Right.
Maybe you're not as alone around here as you think, Danno.
What are we watching?
You getting your ass handed to you in the state championship.
Kukui put all the old games online.
You just got sacked, boss. You should've passed.
Why pass when you can run?
Ah, see, now I gotta admit,
that was a beautiful play.
Your dad couldn't stop screaming.
You were there with my dad?
Yeah.
I was fresh out of the academy,
he was my training officer.
I'll tell you, any day that
Steve McGarrett was starting at quarterback
was an official day off.
I just got one question:
What's a quarterback doing with the number 50?
No, it's five-oh.
Yeah.
No, it's not, it's not 50, it's five-oh.
It's what my dad used to call
our family, because we weren't native Hawaiian,
so he nicknamed us "Five-oh's"
after the 50th state in the Union-- I don't know.
It was his way of making us feel
like we belonged someplace, I guess.
I like that.
