第一集
Help!
He's coming, my prince! He's coming!
We need your help!
Please, sir.
Our kingdom is in great danger.
We need the Savior.
I'm sorry. He's not seeing anyone today.
What's wrong with him?
Jafar.
Please! No!
Pathetic.
The great Savior -- hiding.
This is a sad day, indeed.
Please -- don't hurt him.
I heard, but I had to come see for myself.
Look at the great Aladdin now.
And to think you could have escaped this fate.
You're gonna kill me...
just get it over with.
No, not a chance.
I want to savor this.
Do you remember when we first met?
You were nothing but a common thief.
But you had honor.
Despite what you did to me.
The irony's delicious.
It took becoming a hero for you to completely come apart.
But that's what always happens to Saviors, isn't it?
It's the fate of Saviors.
You give and give...
and give... and for what?
They pick the fruit, they cut the branches,
and all that's left is this...shaky stump.
That's why you never, ever hear these words about a Savior.
"They lived happily ever after."
Do take care, Aladdin.
Oh, wait. What about Henry?
He's with Regina.
Good.
Wait! What about my parents?
They have no interest in walking in on this.
Believe me.
And my leather jacket?
No, it's fine.
?Really?
Yeah, I like the red leather jacket.
What the hell?
What in the hell is that?
It's a dirigible -- from The Land of Untold Stories.
What's it doing in our town?
I believe you mean my town.
This is not your town.
Oh, tell that to the Dark One. He gave it to me.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I must prepare for my friends' arrival.
Regina?
Emma.
My evil half is gone. I don't know how strong I am.
Evil did not make you strong. Let's do this.
Muttonchops!
A word of advice --
Do be careful.
Nothing more dangerous than an untold story --
and the people who don't want them told.
Hello?
Nobody in here.
Where the hell is everyone?
Somewhere out in the forest.
It's hard to tell exactly how many people there are, but look.
From the spacing of their steps, they were running.
Now they're out there, scattered.
What does Hyde want with them?
It's hard to tell.
Depending on who he brought with him,
these stories playing out could create chaos.
Well, that's helpful.
But all may not be lost.
You recall the orderly's baton we used
to subdue Hyde in our realm?
Well, that same technology made the dirigible.
With the wreckage, I may be able to scavenge
what I need to make a weapon that could work on him.
It's the only thing I've ever seen that can bring him down.
Well let's get salvaging.
Hey, Emma, you okay?
Luv? What happened?
Nothing.
Come on. Let's keep going.
All right, Mr. Hyde.
You have the keys to Storybrooke.
Now tell me what I want to know.
How can I wake Belle?
There is a place called The Temple of Morpheus.
In it, you will find sands
that will allow you to walk in Belle's dreams.
Then you'll be able to wake her.
Who are you?
I'm Morpheus.
Welcome to Belle's dreamworld.
Would you like to wake her up?
Zelena?
Regina!
Welcome to the madhouse.
What is going on?
I'm just unpacking.
What's happening out there?
Rumple handed the town over to Hyde.
Say, sounds like it's time for a showdown,
doesn't it, sweetness?
Now have a nice nap
while Mummy helps barbecue mean old Mr. Hyde.
Uh, you should... stay here.
Hyde is impervious to whatever I throw at him,
so we have to play defense.
Well, you kept me in worse prisons.
I've said I was sorry about that.
I'm joking.
Seriously, you opened up your home to us,
so for as long as we're here, I'm -- I'm so grateful.
It'll be good for us.
I've got something for you.
Roland gave me something of Robin's
that he wanted to give to you.
Really?
Yeah, it was, um, it's a feather
from one of his arrows.
So sweet.
You know what? I, um...I remember now.
I put it away somewhere extra specially safe.
Don't even worry about it.
A-A little chaos is normal.
I'm just going to put a protection spell
around the house and over the vault and --
and you can...
find the feather?
I'll find it.
So... you're not angry?
'Course not.
Looks safe and sound to me.
Hyde's not getting into my vault.
Well, we may not have to worry about him anymore.
Jekyll finished his weapon.
Handy one.
Eager to defeat his better half, is he?
Yeah, he is.
How are you dealing with that --
the whole "destroying your evil half" thing?
I'm fine.
Better than fine. It's --
Did I mention I'm fine?
Well, something's bothering you.
All right, yes.
Something is gnawing at me.
Something with red hair and a fondness for pointy hats.
Your sister?
Look, this may sound petty,
but Roland gave her something of Robin's to give to me,
and she already lost it.
A feather from his arrow.
I know you. This isn't about a feather.
I don't know what it's about.
Well, whatever it is, just talk to her about it.
Put it out in the open, deal with your pain.
Maybe.
But right now, let's get Hyde the hell out of town.
Oh, don't avoid this.
I'm not.
But you of all people should know --
heroism comes first.
Emma? Ready?
Yeah.
Mr. Hyde!
Why don't come out and take what you really want?
Or shall I deprive you the pleasure you seek
and kill him myself?
Regina.
Here's what's going to happen --
Leave town, and Jekyll is all yours.
The problem is, my work is here -- in Storybrooke,
and it's only just beginning.
So how about I alter the deal?
I take Jekyll and keep Storybrooke,
and you avoid embarrassing yourself,
because while everyone was afraid of the Queen,
you -- not quite as much.
No deal.
Emma!
Emma!
Emma!
Emma!!
Specially made.
You won't be breaking out of those.
Are you okay?
Is something wrong? Why did you hesitate?
Nothing's wrong. I'm fine.
Are you really, Savior?
Shut up. You're our prisoner now.
Ignore him, Emma.
Yes, ignore me -- just like your tremors.
Wait. Wait. Wha-- What do you know?
More than you.
If you wish to learn what's been happening to you,
you know where to find me.
Archie.
Pongo! Hey!
What are you guys doing here?
Well, I heard you were out looking for new arrivals,
and I thought maybe, uh... maybe you want some coffee.
My parents sent you.
Yeah.
Uh, they -- they're a little worried about you, Emma.
T-They thought it might be easier for you to talk to --
A cricket?
Sorry. I didn't mean that like I was, like, anti... cricket.
I just --
I'm not really in the mood for therapy right now.
And I've found, usually, that's when people need it the most.
You've been fighting bad guys for years without a break.
When I met you all those years ago,
you had nothing but walls around you to protect you.
But since then, with Henry and your family and Hook,
those walls are down.
Isn't that a good thing?
Of course it is.
But it also let in all the collateral damage
of all that fighting.
Great. Then how do I fix that?
With time...
and -- and some hard work.
Can't you, like, give me a pill or something?
When it comes to fixing our biggest problems...
Emma, there are no shortcuts.
So, you've taken me up on my offer.
Smart girl.
Keep calling me "Girl" and see how that works out for you.
Why don't you take these off of me
and see how that works out for you?
You said you knew what was wrong with me.
Prove it.
Emma.
You were a prisoner once. You know how this works.
What makes you think I was in prison?
I was a warden.
I know that caged look.
That's a look that doesn't quite fade.
So you must know that prisoners respond
to carrots and sticks, and you brought neither.
Next time, try a bottle of Syrah and two glasses.
You have no idea how to help me.
I know about the battle --
the one in your mind's eye.
What?
I'm sorry -- I thought you were just leaving.
You're right.
I was in prison.
The worst part about it was the loneliness.
It sucked.
Especially for a guy like you, who likes to talk so much.
So, you can either tell me what you know...
or I'll walk out of here,
and I will not come back with wine.
I just won't come back.
Nobody will.
You can just sit here in silence,
and you can...
...rot.
So you did come with a stick after all.
That's very impressive, Savior.
Except for one small thing.
You are afraid of me, aren't you?
Don't worry.
I brought someone who can help fix your problem.
If you want to find them, just follow the red bird.
The red bird?
The question is, are you truly ready
to face your own story, Savior?
Here we are.
My castle.
Why would Belle want to dream about this place?
Usually, our dreams pick us,
not the other way around.
Rumplestiltskin.
I-I didn't think you'd be back from your journey so soon.
don't be angry, but I don't have the tea prepared.
I-I can have some ready in no time.
Let her go.
She's lost in the dream.
In her mind, she's still a servant,
and you're still a beast.
It's fascinating, isn't it --
to learn how people really see you?
It doesn't matter.
I'll find a way to wake her.
I'm afraid time is a luxury you do not have.
The sands that allow passage to Belle's dream
will not last forever.
If you do not wake Belle within one hour,
she will return to the red room of the sleeping curse --
a most horrid, fiery fate.
And this time, she will remain there forever.
So I would hurry up, if I were you --
if you love her.
Of course I love her!
That's how I'm gonna get her out of here.
I'll make her fall in love with me again.
Look, I know my castle wasn't exactly cheery,
but it was never like this.
To Belle, it was.
This castle terrified her.
So in her dream, it's become a terrifying place.
It's also the place where we fell in love.
If I can just re-create that moment --
It would just be some cruel trick.
Are you willing to lie to her?
It may be a trick,
but my love for Belle is true.
My love for her and my child will never be a lie.
Rumplestiltskin, I-I'm so sorry.
I-I've almost got the tea ready.
It's all right.
See?
It's not even chipped.
Thank you.
I think you've done enough for one day.
Why don't you take a break?
Rumplestiltskin, what's going on?
This, this isn't like you.
I have a ball to attend to later, and I'm a bit rusty.
Will you help me practice?
I...wasn't aware that I had any choices here.
You do.
You're doing wonderfully well.
There's just... one more thing we need.
What --
What has come over you?
Maybe I'm tired of being a beast.
One more dance?
I heard we got Hyde.
I thought it would take weeks and weeks of battles
and twists and turns, and...
here you go doing it Day 1.
Kudos to you, sis.
Yeah. We got him.
What's wrong?
This is the first time I've been back here...
...since Robin died.
I need a moment.
What?
This is just hard.
I know.
I lost someone here, too.
Zelena...I'm sorry, but please go.
Shouldn't we be helping each other?
No.
Why not?
Because...
I blame you.
Every time I look at you, I-I blame you for what happened.
Me?! What about Emma?!
She dragged you to Hell!
I chose to go.
But you -- I trusted you.
And because of that, Robin's soul was obliterated!
Want to talk about trust?
Okay. Let's talk about trust.
You made the biggest decision in your life,
ripping out the evil part of you,
and you just went to Snow White
before coming to your own flesh and blood.
Why do you even care?!
You ripped out the part of yourself
that was most like me!
I don't know what you want me to say.
The baby and I will be out by tonight.
Okay, keep looking.
That was Emma and Hook.
No sign of Hyde or Hyde's friends on the North Side.
It's getting dark.
It's not going to get any easier.
Wait, wait, wait.
Amateurs.
They were in a hurry.
They're hiding because they're scared.
They don't know they can trust us.
Hello?!
My name is Snow White. You can trust me.
Hyde is locked up. He can't hurt you.
The people in our town want to help.
Snow. Look.
There's a place called Granny's that'll give you food,
people who can arrange for shelter.
Let's go.
We'll be there whenever you're ready.
My parents -- They found some of Hyde's people,
sent them to Granny's for food and shelter.
Wonderful. I could use some food and shelter right about now.
You go ahead. I'm -- I'm gonna stay.
Stay? It's pitch-black and it's freezing.
Are you really that desperate to avoid talking to me?
I'm not avoiding talking to you.
I just -- I...need to be alone.
Emma... look at your hand.
What the hell is going on with you?
Nothing.
You can lie to everyone else, but you can't lie to me.
It's fine.
I already asked you once to go.
Right. Fine.
No need to ask again.
I see you met my pet, Emma.
Who are you?
How do you know my name?
I know many things -- like why you're here.
The visions.
Why the hell are they in my head?
Because these visions, Emma, they tell a story.
The story of your future.
Mom?
Why are you doing the locator spell?
Roland had a gift.
Zelena lost it.
Robin's feather.
You know better than anyone why it didn't work.
It's looking for him.
And he's gone.
"Obliterated."
That's how Hades put it.
"His soul destroyed."
That's what Hades said?
You don't believe him?
Villains say whatever they can to hurt people.
But what I choose to believe in is faith --
hope that when a hero's story is over,
there's a special place for them.
This place is looking nicer.
What a shame. Y-You've lived here alone for so long.
I haven't always been alone.
There was a son.
A son?
What happened?
He left.
He saw the darkness in my soul.
I had a chance to change for him,
but...I was too frightened to stop it.
If, uh...
if you could change now...
would you?
For you...
I would be the best man I can be.
Wha--
We've...done this before.
Yes!
No.
Years of promises.
Wait, wait...
I-I-I can't do this again.
T-This time is different. None of this is real.
This all happened a long time ago.
We fell in love. We got married.
And now, Belle, you are with child.
The child was in danger,
so you put yourself to sleep to keep it safe.
Now that danger is gone, and I need you to wake up.
This...is the truth.
But so is what I saw.
All those broken promises --
Rumple... I do love you,
and I believe that you love me,
but us being together -- it only causes heartbreak.
But the b-- the baby.
Our child will be better off waiting with me
than being in debt to you.
I was really hoping that you'd say that.
Wait.
T-There's still sand left. Wait!
I'm so sorry that I put you through all of this.
I just had to be sure
that you wouldn't fall for his lies again.
Now I can wake you up.
"Wake me"?
But -- But how?
With true love's kiss, of course.
But I don't love you.
I-I don't even know you.
Oh, you've known me.
You've known me since the day that I was conceived.
W-Wha-- What's going on?
Oh, I think you know...
Mother.
You're our son.
I will be.
When you sprinkled that sand onto Belle,
you sprinkled it onto me, too.
This isn't just Belle's dreamworld.
It's mine.
And I'm here to warn you --
Do not let him destroy us,
like he did his last family.
Don't listen to him, Belle. He can't be our son.
It's not possible.
Oh, but it is.
And I'll prove it.
Belle.
Our son... h-he was testing me --
playing the part of Morpheus to see if I'd do right by him.
And like my other son...
I've lost him, too.
Even before he's born.
If you ever let true love wake you up,
then maybe you wouldn't keep losing.
We can discuss this at home.
Oh, I'll go back...
but, uh, I'm not making a home with you.
Our son gave me a warning, and I'm going to listen to it.
You keep saying I'm seeing the future,
but it feels like a memory.
How do you know any of this?
I was once called an Oracle.
You'd be wise to trust me.
What you saw was a tiny piece of future time.
Yeah -- tiny. I need to see more.
Knowing the future is a heavy burden.
The future's always in motion, always changing,
but also inevitable.
The visions are coming whether I want them to or not.
Let's get this done.
Look.
I'm not gonna let you hurt them.
What you saw
was a small piece of the end of your story, Savior.
There has to be another way.
You can change the path to the destination,
but the destination is the same.
On the day you saw, in the battle you saw...
you will die.
I see you found my friend. Was she helpful?
You knew exactly what the Oracle was gonna show me,
so cut the crap.
What's coming, and how do I stop it?
Why would I want it to?
Whatever's coming, whether you help me or not,
I will defeat it.
That's funny.
That's what the Saviors always say.
What are you talking about?
That's right, Emma.
You're not the first Savior I've encountered.
Wherever there's a Savior,
there's a villain who brings them down.
That's how the Savior's story always goes.
So, who is it?
I don't know who your villain is.
Maybe they're already here.
Or maybe they came with me.
I expect you'll want to help them, as Saviors do,
but you have to ask yourself --
Is helping them exactly what causes your story to end?
Thought you needed to be alone.
Changed my mind.
Can I have one of those?
Thanks.
You're in a better mood.
You were right. I just needed to get help.
I went back to Archie and figured everything out.
And your hand?
It's was just stress.
You sure that's what it was -- stress?
Promise.
I'm so sorry, Regina.
I know it'll work out, though.
Emma and I had lots of ups and downs
before we learned to really be honest with each other.
Actually, I don't think honesty's our problem.
Well, so what do you think it is?
Robin.
I was an awful stepmother.
Regina, come on. That was the past.
I know I was.
How did you maintain hope during those terrible times?
Well, when my mother died...
...then my father...
I mean, I had nothing.
And then I realized, while y--
well, the Evil Queen was trying to kill me...
...that the only way I could stay alive
was to never give up.
You taught me how to have faith.
You were the one who taught me that hope is a choice.
I think Hades was wrong.
Robin is at peace.
You know, I've been sitting here
thinking about these new people
and how pathetic they were for hiding in some horrible land
so their stories didn't have to play out.
And then I realized...
that's exactly what I used to do.
I don't remember you hiding from anything.
Oh, I did.
My life just stopped.
The only story I heard was the one I kept telling myself --
that I was... the Evil Queen.
Until finally, I forgot the most important thing.
My life was never just one story.
It was many stories.
To some, a villain.
I hurt people...
...in ways I can never make up for.
To others, I'm...
a hero.
They've seen my strength,
my ability to do the hard things,
even when I thought I couldn't.
I want to start a new story.
One where the Evil Queen doesn't get a part.
And I choose to believe that this story...
will have a better ending than my last.
There you are.
Regina?
Isn't life deliciously ironic?
All you ever wanted was a sister.
And when you finally get that wish...
...it's the wrong one.
You...
You're alive.
You can't get rid of me that easily.
What do you want?
Oh, let's have a drink, sis.
It's time for some sisterly bonding.
