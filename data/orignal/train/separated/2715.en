Oh, motherfucker.
Wow. Hey.
Look who's here.
Finally. Look at her.
Her own business now.
I've got some radio ties to help with our Mondays and Tuesdays...
plus I'm thinking about adding some contests later on.
Glenlivet, right, Ton'?
Just seltzer, dear.
Christopher here?
Is he supposed to be?
You want me to call him?
We're gonna sit down there.
VIP table's better!
Hello?
An FBI informant?
I must've been out of cell phone range.
Your accountant didn't reach you? A.J. Said he talked to you four hours ago.
Well, Ginsberg didn't call me.
I'm gonna fuck her face up before I kill her.
Look, I said I'll talk to him, so I'll talk to him.
Cousin Brian is dropping those estate papers off tomorrow.
Good, I'm anxious to look them over.
Let's give it up for No Soap Radio.
Was that a steamroller of a set?
Pick up one of the new CDs for sale up at the front.
Come on, Giovanni.
Jesus Christ, he's pissing his pants.
You want me to do it again?
There you go. Looks pretty good!
Okay, that's great.
Let's bring out your lover.
The weight she put on in rehab... How could she do that to herself?
She always had a bad can. It's genetic.
Hello? Hey, Ma, what's up?
Adriana? You got a call.
Ma, hang on a sec.
Hello?
Adriana, it's me.
Why the fuck are you calling me here?
Don't hang up, because I'll just call back.
Ma, I'll call you later. I know, Ma. Goddamn it, I'll pick up the Sensodyne.
Norman, I got to take this.
Ade, I got a boliage at 11:00.
Are you following me? We wanna talk to you. A&B Bakery...
route 10, East Hanover. I got to drive all the way up there?
You don't want us talking to you in your neighborhood.
And don't go anywhere. We got a unit watching the beauty shop.
I'm getting lights and a wax.
We'll wait.
Janice, hi.
Listen, I can't stay.
I just brought Bobby Junior a couple of Xbox games...
a friend of mine burned for him.
JoJo. Hi. What are you doing here?
Janice, look at you.
I made Bobby and the kids some of my chicken marsala.
It's times like this, I remember when I lost Mikey.
It's impossible to think about food...
but like the President says: "We have to keep going."
The family's got to eat.
I'm picking up the kids after school, Bobby. No argument.
He's hanging in, though, aren't you, Bobby?
Leave those. The girl's coming today.
Then I better do these pots at least.
I've seen Rigoberta with those copper tuffies. What she's done to this Teflon.
Any time you want to drop Sophia and little Bobby off, don't be shy.
I mean it. My kids would love it.
How is Michael Junior doing on the Ritalin?
The way they medicate kids today...It's the answer for everything.
Then they wonder why teenagers get hooked on drugs.
If a child had diabetes, you'd give him insulin.
I didn't mean it like that. Bobby's got to come home anyway.
Karen always made him do his homework before dinner...or it didn't get done.
The chicken, Bobby...
put it in a 350 oven for 20 minutes. You just want to heat it.
And if you have some egg noodles...It's better the first night. Enjoy.
Thank you, JoJo.
Everybody's been so nice. I'll bet.
Look at all these casseroles people brought.
Stuffed shells.Gabriella.
Ziti. Karen made that.
I'm sorry.
That's her last ziti before she died.
I didn't know.
I loved her so much.
I thank God for every day we had together.
She was an angel.
I know. She was special.
Miss La Cerva.
Agent Harris. We met. This is agent Sanseverino.
Hi, Adriana. Eat shit, Danielle.
Or whatever the fuck your name is.
Get you a latte? Scone?
I just want you people to leave me alone. How many times I have to tell you?
I don't know anything.
You people are just trying to scare me. Nobody's trying to hurt Christopher.
What was he doing in Yonkers last night?
What? I don't know.
Somebody saw him having drinks...at the Renaissance Inn
with an individual named Chip Zoto.
Christopher ever mention a Chip Zoto, or just plain Chip?
No. Here's what's problematic.
You don't even know where your boyfriend is.
How do you know if he's in trouble?
He's into heroin, organized crime.
He's associating with some very dangerous people...
not to mention Tony Soprano himself. See, that's where you're wrong.
Tony would never let anything happen to Christopher.
They're cousins, he loves him.
He loved Pussy Bonpensiero. What happened to him?
He went in the Witness Protection program.
Dwight? He went into the program?
You know anything about that?
No.
I think we would've heard.
And your uncle Richie, I suppose he's in the program, too.
He is.
Isn't he?
This is a way out for you. You have your whole life in front of you.
We'd like to see you two have a chance.
Okay.
I'm gonna get back. Where are you going?
You're gonna be working with agent Sanseverino here.
What?
Why?
It's for your own safety.
And you know what we were talking about? About the little creatures?
Good luck with that. I mean it.
Fuck you.
The more you can tell us, the more we can help you and Christopher.
He doesn't need your help. He can take care of himself.
You want some water?
How's Tony been lately?
I have no fucking idea. I told you already.
Been over to the house?
I don't go over there.
Hardly ever.
That should be your area of focus, if possible.
I don't feel so good.
A little more salt?
No, it's delicious.
Listen, I was talking to cousin Brian...
I'm seeing Ginsberg tomorrow.
No, not that. He gave me a free tip on a medical stock that's gonna move soon.
He said we should put $10,000 in it.
$10,000?
It's not that much.
Right.
It's not a meaningful investment.
That much of Dell Computer bought in 1989 is worth $5 million today.
We don't have that kind of money on hand right now.
Things are tight.
Don't you read the papers? The economy?
It sounded like a wonderful opportunity.
What are you gonna do?
Waldorf-Astoria for horses back here. Groom, trainer, three meals a day.
No, watch out for the goat, it butts.
My Nina Lento cooked goat.
What's it doing here?
Horses like company. Seabiscuit had a horse he traveled with.
How do you like that? You own a horse, Tony?
Please, as his accountant...
I thought about it a couple times...but it's an animal, it's a commitment.
Don't tell me with the buck shins again?
No, she's fine. We had a great morning.
Jesus, that's a beautiful horse.
She'll be a bottle of LePage
if she don't win this race.
Bubbala, you want a sure thing?
Buy bonds. Lois is the best trainer here.
This ciuccio, he sells me a horse. The next week it starts losing.
I don't know what got into her. She ran the whole race ahead by two lengths...
and then she just stopped in the backstretch.
Stopped?
Slowed down, finished fourth.
As in out of the money.
Maybe you should try holding her back. Keep something for the finish.
Horse is a front runner. She likes running up front.
So, what if she don't win? I have to agree with Lois here.
A horse has style, you don't fuck with it.
It's her kind of track today. Fast.
She did draw the one hole. Done, said, finished.
Tony, all due respect, I'm inclined to defer to the experts.
Me, too. All right.
Wire to wire.
And tell that midget not to be shy with the whip.
If only his mother had taken that advice.
That's what you're wearing to court?
I'll get it.
Now what?
It's your niece.
Morning, Uncle Jun'.
Great tie.
What's that?
Dinner tonight.
It's some delicious chicken marsala.
Murf, 350 oven for 20 minutes, just so it's hot.
And if you have some egg noodles...
Go bring the car around.
Where you going?
I'm getting my jacket.
I'll bring it. Go get the car, we're late.
I got to go upstairs, get some change for the parking.
I've been meaning to get down to the court to show my solidarity.
But this thing with Bobby... He needs help with those kids.
He needs help? I'm on trial for my life.
He's gonna get through this.
When? I'm waiting like patience on a monument.
You really depend on him, don't you?
This one, he drives like a little old lady. Gas, brake, gas, brake.
You know, I remember Daddy said...that someday Bobby would be your linchpin.
My brother said that?
Bobby was still a head waiter when Johnny died.
Bobby's doing better. We had a very healing day yesterday.
I helped him go through Karen's things for Saint Vincent de Paul.
Psychologically, that's enormous.
Yesterday?
Bobby was home? Why?
He had to take care of something for me, that's why.
What was it? Goddamn it.
Each of us is alone in the fucking universe.
So this estate planning shit...
Carmela wants it, and I got nothing against getting well set up.
Half of these cidrules live one day to the next.
The blue chip portfolio like your cousin's suggesting...
to keep pace with inflation?
If it makes your wife happy, go with God.
I'm supposed to make the money, she takes care of the house.
That's the way it should be.
Carmela's a smart woman. If we start winning in the market...
it's gonna be Intel this and Coca-Cola that. It'll never end.
This other thing your cousin advised...
the life insurance trust? Big red flag.
What? The kid said there was tremendous tax advantages.
To Carmela, when you die.
But present day, if something unforeseen should arise...
divorce, say... that type of trust is irrevocable.
It can't be changed. You have to petition the court, and even then...
Don't get me wrong. A trust, per se, is a good thing.
Avoids probate, prying eyes...but there's other ways to go.
Such as an inter vivos, a living trust.
Here they go. They're in the gate, and they're off.
Come on, baby!
Here we go.
Out of the gate, it's Vision Be Mine, Miss Rae Rae and Zucker's Mother...
going for the lead. Yeah Boy right there on the outside...
Pie-O-My settling into fifth.
Go, goddamn it, go!
Come on, move up!
Come on, baby, come on!
I hate this fucking pygmy. What's he doing?
Get her out of there! Move her up!
Vision Be Mine following by a length, Pie-O-My back two lengths...
No! I got $5,000 on her.
She's gonna make it, here we go! Come on, baby! Come on, girl!
Zucker's Mother, Miss Rae Rae, Vision Be Mine, and Pie-O-My...
joins the front runners. She's coming around! Jesus, look at her go!
Making a move on the outside...
it's Pie-O-My, with a tremendous push, with tremendous speed.
Come on, girl! At the top of the stretch it's Pie-O-My...
challenging Zucker's Mother for the lead.
Pie-O-My and Zucker's Mother!
Pie-O-My and Zucker's Mother as we head for home!
Pie-O-My pulling ahead...Pie-O-My with speed to burn, and it's Pie-O-My!
Pie-O-My coming from behind to win it! Pie-O-My hits the wire first!
Son of a bitch!
I won!
I'm rich! $5,000 at eight-to-one!
Heading for the winner's circle is Pie-O-My, owned by Inez Munoz.
Who is that? That's his girlfriend.
I'll give you a shot in the fucking head. "My girlfriend."
It's his maid. Right, the racing license.
Miss Munoz, as the owner of the winning horse...
you'll receive an 8 x 10 glossy in two to four weeks.
You, Anthony.
What did you say? "Hold her back."
You are not going unthanked. I'm giving a taste of my win.
Hey, Inez!
Come here, have some champagne. Mr. Ralph, I don't know...
There he is. I wanna congratulate you.
I asked, and she was there. You know, not for nothing.
The horse won, but that was not the agreed upon strategy.
Nicky didn't sit on it. She was bumped
out of the gate and got stuck in a speed trap.
So this coming behind, this was a fluke?
This man here, he knew. We all get lucky.
No, right is right, Anthony.
Fluke, escolar, whatever the fuck...I'm giving you your taste.
Your money's no good. - I insist.
She ran your race. You called it.End of story.
$300, $400, $500, $600.
And I need $150 more this week for A.J.'s football cleats.
In my day, they were $50.
$50? That's what I pay to get your suits out of the cleaners.
So you got those papers for me to sign?
Brian's?
I told you I'd talk to Ginsberg.
Got a pen?
Anthony Soprano, that is wonderful.
That's so great, I am so impressed.
"Authorization to open an account." It's wherever there's a little red arrow.
And there.
You need to sign the agency papers here, too.
It gives Brian authorization to buy stocks on our behalf.
Where the little circles are here, initials?
You will not regret this, Tony, truly.
This is the best thing for all of us. It'll give us such peace of mind.
Wait, there's one more.
I'm not gonna sign that one.
Why not?
I don't think it's a good idea.
But this is the trust. It's in case something happens to you.
I'm not gonna sign it.
You have to.
Remember your children, your wife? So they don't end up out on the street?
Yeah, well, there's better ones. "In vitro" something.
What? What's wrong with this one?
It's irrevocable.
We don't wanna get locked in.
To what?
"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee." Excuse me?
It's the government, Carm. You've got to be flexible.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Come on, Carm, be fair. I gave you two out of three.
You gave me?
In here, hon.
What're you doing in bed? We got dinner with Tony and Carmela.
I can't go. I'm sick.
What do you mean?
I don't know, I got chills and a fever.
I think I'm getting the flu. I shouldn't go up there.
Come on, get dressed. Couple of drinks, it'll kill the germs.
You better go without me.
But you have to go.
This is the inner sanctum, here. I'm not just a relative anymore.
You think Paulie and his cumares ever get invited to dinner with them?
I'm sorry.
Maybe if I just sleep...
Nothing ever goes my way.
Is that sausage? My mom made it with hamburger.
See?
Just a spoonful, Jan. That's enough, thanks.
Why don't you kids tell Daddy what we saw on the way home from school today?
The Fuji blimp over Willowbrook Mall?
So?
You kids seemed to like it when you saw it.
You begged me to follow it.
It was nice of you to pick them up for me.
And making dinner.
Enjoy, everybody.
It does smell good, doesn't it?
Did you eat yet?
I'll get something at home.
No, it's all right, isn't it, kids?
Can we eat in front of the TV?
That's rude.
No, kids.
I'm the one barging in. You go right in there.
You know how to set up the TV trays. You want a little more?
Okay. It's pretty good, actually.
Thank you, Bobby.
I told you I don't want them to be spoiled because they lost their mother.
I saw my uncle today.
Jesus.
That's right.
Is he mad?
What's going on, Bobby? What were you supposed to do?
Union business.
What's going on?
This election coming up, that's all.
I'm the one that should've been in that car...not Karen.
And Junior's been so good to me, and I'm letting him down.
Fuck him! He only thinks of himself, selfish old fuck.
Now listen to me. I know my uncle, he's a patient man.
But he's at the point, if you don't do your job...
he'll find somebody who will, you know what I'm talking about?
All your effort, all the years you put in getting your ticket punched...
you'll be a nobody. I don't care anymore.
That's the problem.
I don't care if I live or die.
We lose that luxury when we have children.
I remember my son Harpo, when my husband left us...
I had both barrels of a shotgun in my mouth...
but then just one thought of Harpo...
my little boy without his mother...
Every day is worse than the last.
My uncle loves you.
He needs you.
So you're going to get up tomorrow morning...and you're going to get dressed,
and you're going to get in that car...
and you're going to do what needs to be done,
aren't you?
Okay, then. Now will you eat something?
Show me one of those trusts, the living ones.
Okay, I can see where you'd want more mutability, Ton'.
Mutability mean money? Because that's what I want.
Carmela's cousin, Brian Cammarata. Ralphie Cifaretto.
This is the life.
What life's that?
I didn't mean...
I'm kidding, .
just kidding. Any cousin of Tony's..
Lois, how's she look today?
Been clocking her best fractions yet, 21.45.
She's in some rich company, though. Zucker's Mother again.
And this other one, frigging Kentucky thoroughbred.
You wanted a stakes horse,
this is a stakes race. I think she's ready.
So, Dr. Dolittle, any thoughts? Only six furlongs.
She should run it head-to-head. Excuse me, senor,
if I'd listened to you last time...
She's right.
Short race like this, let her blow them away.
Foolish that I am...I'm going to place some bets.
They're all in line, and they're off.
Look. The five horse bumped her. You see that, piece of shit!
Come on, baby!
It's Zucker's Mother with Tenant's Harbor to the inside in the lead.
Zucker's Mother, Lil' Camille, Pie-O-My and Tenant's Harbor sprint for the lead.
Run, goddamn it!
Go!
Coming to the top, Pie-O-My has the rail in the lead...
Pie-O-My ahead by two lengths as they...
Run, you fucking nag! Come on, Pie!
Come on, baby, go! She's pulling ahead!
Here comes Lil' Camille from the outside.- Come on, Pie!
Go!
He can't get you!- She just can't beat Pie-O-My.
Yeah, baby!
Pie-O-My hits the wire first, Lil' Camille was second
and Tenant's Harbor, third.
Beautiful!
Damn it, I bet to show.
What'd you win, $5? My financial advisor.
This is it. This is happiness.
Winning is one thing, but when it's your horse, right?
Yeah.
Once again, your horse wisdom is not going unappreciated.
Heading to the winner's circle is Pie-O-My.
Pie-O-My is owned by Inez Munoz... and trained by Lois Pettit.
I see the flowers got here.
Which you like better, the lilies or the roses?
I came into some cash.
Sold a property down on Frelinghuysen Avenue.
It's okay, let's buy that stock. It split. It's too late, we missed it.
You're Teddy Genaretti, aren't you? The shop steward for local 184?
Guilty. You a joint fitter?
What can I get you? Wild Turkey, neat.
I saw your Caravan in the lot. It's a nice car for a family.
Do I know you?
Jim Blake.
What local you in? Bad back.
I follow these things, you know, with this election coming up.
Dick Hoffman for President?
I heard he's got 184's vote. I think it's a mistake.
Pension's been ripped off for the last 25 years.
I'm sure you guys got grievances, but Dick Hoffman?
What do you owe this guy? It's all talk. He's out of touch with reality, Dick.
You think if push came to shove he'd give a fuck about you?
I know what you're trying to do.
You look like a smart guy.
I can see why your local puts their faith in you to do the right thing.
I'm just saying, if it was me...
I got kids that depend on me, like yourself.
And to waste my votes on somebody like Dick Hoffman?
I might as well put a bullet in my head, here.
Affordable solutions to all your fitness challenges.

with the Body by Jake Bun and Thigh Rocker...
the three minute hip, thigh and bun machine.
So now you can quickly and easily trim and tone the hips and thighs.
What are you, up?
Cosette, go to your basket.
What's the matter with you?
Because I'm glad to see you.
I worry about you staying out so late.
Since when?
You hungry? Want some scrambled eggs?
Yeah, all right.
I'm thinking...maybe we should try someplace else.
I saw this thing on TV, a tour of this house in Santa Barbara...
you should've seen the flowers they had, the ocean.
I was in California, I didn't like it. I'm just saying, we're young.
We got our whole life in front of us.
Looks really nice out there. No snow.
You're burning the butter.
Let's be honest. What's our future here?
You could end up in jail, or something horrible could happen.
Fucking negative shit. Stop with that.
Somebody could have it in for you.
Who?
I don't know.
What kind of shit is this? Who told you that?
Nobody.
Fucking negative shit coming out of your mouth!
I had that fucking bird watching me when I got made.
I'm already under a what-do-you-call-it, possibly.
So stop with that.
I worry about you, that's all.
I love you so much.
So if you love me, stir my eggs, okay?
Excuse me.
Is Tony here?
All right, we'll wait in the office.
What can I get you?
Can I see a bar menu? I'll take a CC-and-7.
Nachos Grande and a Diet Coke.
Where's your office, in the back?
You should play Skynyrd.
Smells in here. Mold.
Stuff can kill you, I read. Fuck that.
What the fuck you think cheese is? Mold.
Holy!
You okay?
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.
And I gotta rot in that courtroom.
I'll put the heat on under the gravy.
My daughter's coming over to the house for dinner, so I gotta go.
The three men were arrested in Germany last month.
Did we miss it, goddamn it?
In other news, in the Federal courthouse in Newark,
there were few surprises... in the racketeering trial
of Corrado "Junior" Soprano.
The 72-year-old defendant
listened as government auditors detailed...
financial irregularities at Comley Trucking.
The prosecution outlined how accounting...
What the fuck?
What?
What kind of likeness is that?
If they were great artists, they'd be in a museum.
I'm fucking fodder for cartoonists now?
You know, a little support in the courtroom would be nice...
or are you still hanging crepe? I took care of the thing, last night.
The guy, you saw him?
Him and 184 won't be a problem.
Good.
Hand me that weight over there. The one in the middle.
Glad to see you're back in the swing of things.
That moping around, you gotta put it behind you,
get on with your life. That's what Janice said.
She's been wonderful through all this.
Looking after Bobby Junior and Sophia, bringing dinner over the house.
She's a pretty good cook.
Since when? Everybody steers clear of her food.
She made lasagna the other night, delicious.
With sweet sausage along with the beef. I thought Karen's was good, but...
Sweet sausage? In little pieces?
A layer of basil leaves right underneath the cheese?
That's right.
That's Carmela's lasagna.
What the fuck are you talking about?
You always think the worst of everybody.
Fine.
Enjoy your lasagna. Just don't come running to me.
Shit!
Go see if he's all right.
They were here until 1:00. I couldn't even get into my office.
This is a good thing, Adriana.
Why?
They don't pay for nothing. They ran up a $200 bar bill.
Overcharge some of those college students.
Ralph and them wanted to know if Tony was here. Why, is he going to be?
You don't know what this guy did for me.
I do.
Not getting my stripes. Something I can't talk about.
Something that was ruining my whole life, and he made it right.
What I owe him, I would follow that man into hell.
But why do they have to come here? I don't understand.
This place isn't bugged. The cops and the feds don't know about it.
Probably in time they will, until then...
Oh, shit.
They broke my fucking chair!
We're having Sunday dinner at Tony's, and you're coming.
I don't care if your mother's dying.
Your honor, I introduce as evidence government exhibit 27-B...
which is a stipulation between the parties that, if called as a witness...
Koren W. Jonic, supervisor of the US Post Office...
Iocated at 8721 Wayland Avenue in Paramus...
would testify that post office box, number 206...
was registered to and paid for...
by one Ira E. Barad, who resides at 43 Bellingham Boulevard...
apartment 4-B, Paramus, New Jersey...
and was initially rented by Ira E. Barad...
on September 16, 1998 with a payment of...
I don't care what your psychic said.
If a guy don't call back within the first 48 hours... No, don't!
Don't call him, Ma. Because I don't want to hear about it.
Fuck.
Nothing, Ma, I gotta go. I'll call you later, bye.
I can't stay. Christopher's waiting for me.
Just checking in, seeing how you're doing.
How I'm doing? I can't even get my dog clipped anymore?
Anything interesting going on?
No.
Ralph Cifaretto was in your club.
Vito Spatafore, Gene Pontecorvo, and Patsy Parisi.
It's the law. If they got shirts and shoes on, I gotta serve them.
Ralph Cifaretto drove down to Philadelphia last Thursday.
Had a couple of guys with him.
You know who was in the car?
No.
You ever heard the name Cogo...
Giovanni?
No.
Okay, look...
Patsy Parisi goes to White Plains all the time. He gets these suits.
Suits?
Yeah, suits.
Some guy came in, and Patsy went out and got him a bunch of suits.
Boss and stuff, half dozen, dozen.
From his car.
See? How hard was that?
Finally, the woman finds the Easy Off.
Thanks for picking the kids up.
No prob.
So, how about you, how was your day?
Good.
I knew it.
See, I knew you would feel better. Did you make sure that my uncle knows?
Yeah.
We should celebrate.
I'll make something nice for dinner.
No. I mean, we should go out.
Vesuvio?
Takes too long for them.
Kids like Chinese.
MSG. I collapsed one time at the Hunan Palace, complete blackout.
I'll just open a can of soup.
That's crazy. There must be something I can heat up.
Really, Janice, you do too much already.
What about this?
Karen's ziti?
I'm not ready to eat that yet.
I understand.
Hold on a minute, hon.
Sorry.
What does that mean, "basically"?
He's laying out that kind of cash to us every week.
He'll write a check to our shell companies, we'll take the tax hit.
You got it.
How's our girl?
Our girl?
Yeah, she had a hot tendon.
You know, it's always something with her.
You should see the veterinarian bills. Fucking racket.
Know what I think we should do, if you don't mind my saying?
Switch her shoes to those titanium ones that Heshie was telling me about.
They don't weigh anything.
So they're good for a tender hoof. Sure. Why not?
Here you are, baby.
You don't have to answer it.
See who it is.
You want me to answer it?
Will you answer the fucking phone?
Hello, I need to speak with Mr. Ralph.
It's your maid.
What? She's gotta go to the clinic again tomorrow?
You talk to her, tell her to get her ass in here.
He isn't in.
Because the horse is very sick,
and he put the horse in my name...and he say I won't get in no trouble.
The horse doctor won't do nothing...
because Mr. Ralph don't pay the money he owes to him...
and the horse may to die,
and I don't know what is to do! All right, wait.
Hold on.
Your horse is sick and the vet won't do nothing till he's paid.
These guys, no compassion for the fucking animals whatsoever.
Maybe you better go down there.
Tell her to call 555-0157.
At the outbreak of the second great war in 1939...
Sir Winston again answered his
country's call as the First Lord of the Admiralty.
Churchill.
Remember you saw that TV movie you liked about him?
Carmela, can you shut the door?
Carmela, can you please shut the door?
The horse is sick.
The lady, she...
Who's this?
Mr. Ralph's housekeeper. The horse is very sick, and she said to call,
because they needed...
Slow down.
The horse is sick, the Pie-O-My.
How bad is it?
They said she may to die.
The doctor, he won't do nothing until he gets...
All right. Tell him I'll take care of it.
Son of a bitch.
I am now nearing the end of my journey.
I hope I still have some services to render.
Where are you going?
I gotta go out.
It's raining.
Ralphie Cifaretto's horse is sick, and they can't find him.
Somebody's gotta go down there and pay the vet.
Down where?
The racetrack.
It's a racehorse?
So why do you have to go?
You bought a racehorse?
No, I didn't buy it.
It followed you home?
The horse is sick.
I told him you were coming with the money.
He finally gave her something to settle her down, so I don't know.
Will she be all right?
At least she stopped thrashing.
That's where the danger is. The intestines get twisted, and you have to cut.
They're finished as racers then.
You the vet?
I gave her a shot, she's quieted down.
Here. Here's your fucking money.
You better hope she's going to be all right.
Good girl.
That's a good girl.
Trust me.
Trust me. It's okay.
Good girl.
It's okay.
