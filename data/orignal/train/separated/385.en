Over 68 million Americans
leave the safety of our borders every year.
If danger strikes,
the FBI's International Response Team
is called into action.
I can't believe we're doing this!
Hell, yeah, we are!
This is crazy!
Dude, you'll be fine. Just keep running.
Remember, you fall, don't try and get up.
Curl into a fetal position, protect your head.
You do not want to be eye level with those horns.
They're singing for protection, asking the saints to keep us safe.
How cool is that? All right, all right.
It's 2 minutes till 8:00. Lew here.
With Clint and Kev,
Getting set to test ourselves
against the mighty toros bravos of Pamplona!
That we just found out run at 35 miles per hour.
Kev thinks we should have gone to Vegas.
But Clint here wanted to celebrate his 40th
by cheating death itself.
Come on, you love it!
This is it! The bulls are loose!
If we get split up,
let's regroup behind that cafe we had breakfast at,
okay? Behind the cafe!
Hell, yeah!
Whoo! What a rush!
Ronaldo is the best player in the world right now.
I don't know. Messi's a genius,
and he's adorable.
Athletes should not be described as adorable.
Oh, well, I don't remember you being bothered
when somebody called you something similar
in the "Men of the FBI" calendar.
That was for charity.
W-wait a minute, when was this?
That was last year. Jack was Mr. July.
No. - One word -- fireworks.
No.
Duty calls.
Let's get everyone up to speed, Monty.
Kaixo. Okay, two days ago,
Clint Smith, a lawyer from Seattle,
went missing in Pamplona.
He had traveled to Spain to take part in the running of the bulls
and disappeared shortly after his first bull run.
His friends, Americans Lew Donovan
and Kevin Garcia reported him missing
when he failed to return after the race that morning.
Then yesterday, Clint Smith's ears,
and only his ears, were found severed
in Vasconia plaza inside the old city.
Why ears?
Could be symbolic.
Maybe our unsub wants to be heard.
Or maybe it's a scare tactic.
Terrorist groups have been known to cut off ears, noses,
and lips just to make a statement,
you know, incite fear.
What about the rest of his body?
It hasn't been found.
Monty ran the M.O. through Interpol and got a hit.
Okay, this time last year,
the ears of three Australian citizens
were found scattered across Pamplona.
All three had traveled to Spain
to take part in the running of the bulls.
Six months later, their partial remains
were found scattered outside of the city limits.
U.S. Embassy wants us on the ground immediately.
Is there any connection between the Australian victims?
None that local P.D. can tell.
They were taken every couple of days
in different locations and times,
and their ears were left at three distinct landmarks.
Didn't Don Quixote
have his ear cut off by a Basque traveler?
He was wounded after his battle
with the famous windmills of La Mancha.
I saw the movie.
This says the ears were left at famous Basque landmarks.
Pamplona is part of the kingdom of Navarre,
land of the Basques.
Given the history, maybe our unsub
is trying to make a political statement?
So, we need to determine whether these attacks are part
of a larger political agenda,
or the work of a disturbed individual.
Well, either way, if the pattern holds,
the unsub will strike again, soon.
And with more Americans in Pamplona than ever before,
it's our job to stop him before he does.
Don't!
第一季第十二集
Too much sanity may be madness,
and the maddest of all,
to see life as it is, and not as it should be.
Miguel de Cervantes.
There's something like a million people
that descend on Pamplona during this week.
They run the bulls every day.
They have parades and bullfighting, fireworks.
Hemingway described it as a "furious energy."
An expression of the ephemeral.
Life and the death and the fleeting moments in between.
Benjamin Esposito.
You must be Agent Garrett.
That's right.
Welcome to Pamplona.
Thank you. This is my team.
Agent Seger. Agent Simmons.
And Jarvis.
Thanks for your cooperation.
I was the lead detective on the case last year,
and I have been dreading this day ever since.
I knew a criminal this twisted would strike again.
They usually do, but if we can build a profile
in conjunction with the physical evidence,
We have a good shot at catching him.
As you can imagine,
an event like this is a huge boost
to the local economy.
Because of this, my superiors
have asked to keep low profiles
so as not to cause any alarm.
Por favor.
So, what can you tell us about
your initial investigation?
Well, the three sets of ears belonging
to the Australian citizens
didn't leave us much to go on.
Witnesses proved unreliable.
The case went cold.
This way.
And you found remains for each of the Australians?
Yes. The bodies were dismembered
and found washed up in a ditch off the highway.
The ears of both the first Australian victim
and American Clint Smith were dumped here
in the same spot in this courtyard, yeah?
Here, Vasconia Plaza.
That's home to an important Basque memorial.
Yes, Basque nationalists
have a history of trying to co-op the fiesta.
We have seen large-scale demonstrations, intimidation,
and on some occasions, violence.
Much like the U.K. and the Irish Republican Army,
you've been dealing with these issues for decades.
Last year, there were whispers
that these attacks were part of a larger Basque agenda,
but no one is taking credit.
Simmons, let's take advantage of
the extensive media coverage
and review the festival footage.
We need to find Clint's last known location.
I'll talk to Clint's friends, Lew and Kevin.
Great. Mae, take a look at the forensic evidence.
The ears. Got it.
Detective, we need to surveil
the two previous disposal sites.
It's likely the attacker or attackers will revisit.
We've got officers monitoring the grounds.
I'd like to view the memorial
where Clint Smith's ears were found.
I can take you there.
Mijo?
The ears were found right here.
Were your men able to dust for prints?
Well, the festival brings a lot of additional foot traffic,
so we've had trouble pulling anything conclusive.
The day the ears were found,
there was a lot of people everywhere.
The crowds were buying a sense of anonymity
that would allow the unsub to move around freely.
There was a riot in '78 that took place in this plaza.
A Basque man was struck by the authorities,
violence erupted.
They had to cancel the fiesta that year.
This memorial is a call for peace.
So, our killer knows his history.
Maybe he feels his statements are falling on deaf ears.
If this is about politics,
why attack turistas?
Maybe he blames them.
For what?
Distracting from the true meaning of San Fermín.
At its heart, the festival
is a religious celebration, correct?
Yes. It is a way for us to honor and give thanks
to the patron son of Pamplona, San Fermin.
Who found the ears?
Father Consolmango. Two days ago.
I am Father Consolmango.
Father.
Detective Esposito said that you're the one
who found the remains.
Yes.
A strange thing, this removal of the ears.
You have a pretty good view of the memorial.
What can you recall about the moments leading up
to your discovery?
It was morning.
I went outside and spotted them in the --
in the plaza.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious
in the last few days?
I have heard of many bad deeds
done in these late days.
But I have not witnessed anything myself.
Detective Esposito and I are trying to stop a killer
and save the life of an innocent man.
If you know something,
you'd be serving the cause of justice.
I'm sorry.
I cannot be of more help.
Excuse me.
I have a Mass to prepare for.
Buenos Días.
Gracias.
He knows something he isn't saying.
The father made it clear. He didn't see anything.
He said he's heard of many bad deeds,
maybe in confidence or via confession.
That is a sacred boundary.
I mean, how often do you think killers confess to their priests?
If our unsub did confess,
it would say something about him.
That he feels guilty?
This is EspaÑa, a catholic country.
Guilt is a way of life.
Yes, but for a violent offender like this,
it's a contradiction, one we need to understand.
Father Consolmango would never violate his oath,
and he's under no obligation to do it,
so we need to pursue other lines of inquiry.
The Spanish should be ashamed of themselves, man.
All this talk of this festival honoring the bulls is bull.
These people are just concerned with how much money they're gonna make.
It's so commercialized.
Get some "B" Roll. I'll catch up with you later.
Well, it looks like they were sliced cleanly, one cut.
Lack of hesitancy speaks to our killer's resolve.
Do you have the report on the ears that we found last year?
We have the ears.
Oh, great. Can I take a look?
Based on the cut itself, I would venture to say
that these were done with a small, curved blade
like a hunting knife or a paring knife.
That is what we thought, as well.
Let's see if these stick in the pattern.
So, how long have you been working here?
I've been producing a local television coverage
for almost a decade now.
I have to say that the running of the bulls has to be
one of the most photographed spectacles in the world.
It's a great advertisement for the city itself.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure ESPN rolls tape
on a guy getting gored almost every year.
San Fermin is to Spain
what Mardi Gras is to your New Orleans.
A never-ending party fueled by equal parts adrenaline
and sangria.
I pulled up some locations
based on the information you provided.
Yeah, this looks like the spot.
Can you blow it up?
This is the San Francis Xavier Cathedral and fountain.
Stupid guiri should know better than to urinate on a church.
That's clint. Freeze it there.
He's got a lot of nerve to do something like that.
Can you get me a screen grab on that?
Yes, of course.
I think I may have something.
So, we know our Australian victims have little in common
with each other, and even less in common with clint?
So, it got me thinking,
what if our victims were chosen not because of who they are,
but because of something they did?
Maybe without even realizing it.
Clint relieved himself in the fountain
of a very famous cathedral.
Pretty easy to see how that could upset someone.
There's no shortage of bad behavior around here.
To the locals, it must be infuriating.
If Clint was attacked because if he offended someone,
maybe our previous victims caused offense, as well.
But would that make them the target
of Basque nationalists?
Not likely.
Plus, if this is the work of a political group,
someone would have came forward, taken credit by now.
You're right. This isn't political.
These people are being punished.
Victimology here is key.
Simmons, see if you can get access
to the festival's video archives.
I'll have Monty run the Australian vics
through his fancy program.
If the act of offense is the unsub's trigger,
do we think their transgressions would be the same as Clint's?
We need to look for patterns.
Excuse me.
And we need to see if Clint or any of the previous victims
have crossed paths with any of the same locals.
His friends couldn't give me any details,
so it's worth a look.
Yeah, I'll get Monty up to speed.
With so little evidence,
we need to reduce the potential victim pool.
Yes, this is IRT Unit Chief Jack Garrett.
I need you to connect me with the American ambassador
in Madrid.
State Department's not gonna be happy.
Nor detective Esposito,
but we need to issue a travel alert
to all Americans in the area.
Charles, we have a situation.
Detective Esposito says that his men didn't see anything.
They responded to the screams
when a couple of tourists noticed the ears.
This way.
Thank you.
Now he's taken a second victim.
Well, he sure knows how to blend in.
Cops nearby, clergy.
He's taking a risk being here.
Yeah, it speaks his compulsion.
Okay, so unlike before,
when our unsub displayed the Australian's ears
just down the street near City Hall,
these were left right
in the inside of San Fermin Cathedral.
I got to say, dropping ears
at the doorstep of the patron saint
feels pretty darn symbolic.
No kidding, but is it an offering
or a form of defiance?
The way that they're presented like this, out in the open,
it makes me think it's the latter.
It's certainly a bold statement.
Based on the angle of excision on the edges,
I can say that our unsub definitely used the same knife.
So, according to our theory, do we think
this victim also defamed the church in some way?
Maybe he offended good old Saint Fermín himself?
Or maybe our unsub has appointed himself
the new patron saint of Pamplona,
and these are just a form of consecration?
When I asked you to keep this quiet,
issuing a travel warning to all visiting Americans
was not exactly what I had in mind.
We have to get ahead of this guy.
It's imperative that we warn the public,
and I'd like to pay another visit
to Father Consolmango -- he knows something.
He wasn't forthcoming with us earlier.
Father Consolmango has been
a pillar of this community for over 30 years.
Señor Garrett, you must understand
the politics involved.
If I reach out to the archdiocese
with such a request, they will deny it.
They want nothing to do with our investigation.
We need to know what he knows.
I have already been reprimanded by my superiors
for bringing you to question him.
They gave me an ultimatum.
I have to make progress,
or I am off the case, and you with me.
This is the last we speak of this.
Detective. I'd like to give you
our preliminary profile on the killer.
My team has made progress.
Let's break down what we've got so far.
So, we know because of the size and the age of the victims
that we're looking for a physically fit male
local to the greater Pamplona area.
And in flaunting the ears inside the San Fermín Cathedral
it is a direct challenge to the church.
It's like he's -- anointing himself god.
The ultimate arbiter of life and death for his victims.
A pretty extreme form of narcissism.
Yeah, which means he'll be outspoken
and very aggressive in his beliefs.
Now, as far as why he has chosen to express his rage in this way,
by cutting off the ears, it could be a scare tactic.
Like the cartels in Mexico.
The more extreme the mutilation,
the more terrifying the message.
In this case, "Get off my lawn."
We found that with offenders like this,
their anger is rooted in a past conflict or trauma.
Although our research has yet to turn anything up.
You want to expand our parameters?
I'll make a few calls, see if we can get access
to the records of the regional police,
the Ertzaintza's, as well as the national police.
Good.
Jack.
Monty's got something for us.
You told me to look for patterns.
Now, the thing about looking for patterns
is you start to see them everywhere,
even in places you don't expect.
Using facial recognition,
I was ble to track two of our three Australian victims so far.
Our first Australian victim
took a selfie while on the course.
Festival organizers banned the use of cell phones.
A few years ago, a man did this and got himself gored.
Our second Australian victim
hit the bull with a rolled-up newspaper.
What's the big deal? He just reached out
and tried to tap the bull. Isn't that what you do?
The rolled-up newspaper is supposed
to be unfurled to distract the bull
from striking you if you get too close.
Swatting at the bull is dangerous.
Distracting the animal by so much
As touching it could steer it off course.
Separate it from the herd.
And bulls separated from the herd
are far more liable to attack.
In running, you're joining the herd
for its final moments of freedom.
It's a sacred thing.
So, each of our victims
dishonored the sanctity of the run.
Not just that, the bulls themselves.
Clint's goal was to run on the horns,
but what do you want to bet
he also got a little too close and personal?
Well, let's see.
He tried to touch the bull.
This has nothing to do with religion.
This is about our victim's actions
toward the animals themselves.
They disrespected the bull.
Do you think our unsub was on the course?
Or he could have been in the plaza.
Photo booths post pictures of the day's run almost
frame by frame so people can find themselves.
According to these police reports,
I got a guy who keeps popping up in the same places
as our Australian vics, Carlos Villa.
Carlos Villa, animal rights activist.
He was arrested three years ago in Madrid
for trespassing after he tried to sabotage a bullfight.
This guy has been arrested 13 times since 2007.
All the charges were regarding animal cruelty?
Yes, there is currently a warrant out on him
for aggravated assault.
Do we know if he's crossed paths with each of our victims?
That's a good bet, indirectly if not directly.
And he arrived in Pamplona the night
before Clint went missing.
He's got an axe to grind regarding
the mistreatment of the bulls.
Where is he now?
According to his twitter feed,
at a protest in the City Square.
Jack and Mae are closer.
Hey! Come on.
Carlos, I am not hearing a lot of empathy
for the loss of life.
Empathy?
Most of the people that come here don't even know
that the same bulls run through the street
in the morning are slaughtered that night!
Over 7,000 bulls were killed in bullfights in Spain last year.
All right, so why'd you run?
There's a warrant out on me for a trumped-up charge.
It was a cosmetics testing facility
that routinely abused the animals in its care.
They didn't like when I took pictures.
But I never cut anyone's ears off before
if that's what you're asking.
You ever seen this man?
No.
Mr. Villa, this is a murder investigation.
Three men are dead and two are missing.
Did you know that, on special occasions,
matadors cut the ears and tails off their vanquished bulls
as trophies?
You see, the matador and his assistant work together
to weaken the animal,
and in a show of dominance, slice its ears off.
The bull dies.
Coughing up its own blood, too debilitated to even move.
And in a final act of impudence,
the matador hurls the animal's ears into the crowd
so they can be trampled on.
And it's man that deserves my sympathy?
Monty, tell us something good.
Okay, I got the idea on the second set of ears.
They belong to Tony Downs,
A 32-year-old animal rights activist from Chicago.
That doesn't make any sense.
Why would one activist kill another activist?
He didn't.
We just confirmed Carlos' alibi.
He was at the hospital
having his arm treated at the time Clint disappeared.
He's not our guy.
Hey. Carlos' alibi checks out.
These attacks aren't about sending a message
or making a statement.
They're about establishing dominance.
In keep the bodies and discarding
the victim's ears, our killer is emulating the matador.
In Spain, bullfighting isn't a sport.
Matadors, capes, costumes --
It's as much symbolic as it is theatrical.
It is performance art that ends in a ritual sacrifice.
A tragedy told in three acts.
Just like our unsub.
Three victims, three deaths, three disposal sites.
This isn't someone who sees man as inferior,
but the bulls as superior.
Detective, what's the significance of the three stages?
In the first terico,
called the Third of Lances, the matador observes the bull.
He tests him, revealing his character.
The second stage, called the Third of Flags,
is when the matador's assistants,
his cuadrilla, put their stakes in the animal to weaken him,
but also to anger him.
And the final stage --
Third of Death.
Exactly.
This is when the matador uses his puntilla
to slay the animal in a final demonstration of supremacy.
Puntilla?
It is a small, curved knife
that severs the bull's spinal cord.
That sounds like the weapon our unsub's
using to remove the ears.
So like our unsub,
the matador stalks them, tortures them, and kills them.
You think we're looking for a torero? A matador?
Or someone who thinks of themselves as one.
Like a torero, someone who respects the animal as an equal,
or the opponent.
Let's cross-reference former and current matadors
with criminal records that fit the profile.
The festival employees are almost completely accounted for,
and we have confirmed the alibis
for all the matadors currently in Pamplona.
Jack?
Our unsub has a very narrow comfort zone,
yet the crowds all but guarantee
he is not holding his victims here.
Yeah, but he needs time to torture them,
so he's holding them somewhere.
Yeah, we know he's mobile.
And he's sophisticated,
so he'd know better than to hold two adult males at one time.
So, what is he doing with the bodies?
Let's say he's keeping the vics.
He'd need a place that's secure and private.
Probably outside of the city.
Like a ranch? A warehouse?
There's less than a dozen ranches
that provide bulls to the festival, right?
Historically, yes.
But today, there must be more than 30 breeders
spread across the country.
There's no one that has more respect
or a more vested interest
in the well-being of the bulls than the breeders.
Or the people they employ.
Perdón, Señor.
Sí.
Robert Tanida.
A third American citizen,
Robert Tanida, has been reported missing.
Third victim, just like the Australians.
Detective Esposito, can you assist my agents
in finding out what the family knows,
and quickly?
Yes.
If our unsub has his third and final victim,
this is our last chance to catch him.
I'm gonna follow up with something.
I'll be back soon.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been two weeks since my last confession.
And are you here now to confess?
No.
I believe you have information that can help my investigation.
I had a feeling you would return.
You are a dutiful agent, Mr. Garrett.
And a man of faith.
A Catholic.
You would have me disobey Canon Law
and divulge information
I learned in this sacred space that we are now in?
I understand the position I'm putting you in.
You want me to defy my covenant with god,
one that you believe in!
Do you know who's responsible for these crimes?
Mr. Garrett, please.
Innocent men are dying. Their killer might go free.
What you are asking of me is not possible!
This killer deserves to answer for his crimes here and now.
Surely there is a moral imperative
that you can't ignore.
Father, I mean no offense.
I can imagine the burden that you must feel.
See, I've lived with my life as you have,
serving a cause greater than myself,
and I, too, took an oath.
Clint Smith.
Tony Downs.
Robert Tanida.
There's still time to save their lives.
We'll find another way.
Thank you for your time.
"God opposes the proud.
But shows favor to the humble."
Do you know this proverb?
Peter is trying to remind us
that it is not our place to know all things.
It is a passage I return to often.
If only to humble myself before our Father.
I pray that you catch this man.
And put him away.
Peace be with you, Mr. Garrett.
And also with you, Father.
Let me guess. He wasn't forthcoming.
He's -- he's a good man in an impossible situation.
What did he say?
"God opposes the proud, but shows favor to the humble."
Proverbs.
It's also mentioned
in the Book of Peter to the shepherds
to be faithful servants to their flock,
to watch over those entrusted to their care.
Is the verse significant?
Maybe not in content, but context.
Monty. I want you to do a search.
Sure thing, what's going on?
Father Consolmango said what he could,
and what he gave me was 1 Peter 5:5.
Could be an address.
Part of a phone number.
Date of birth.
Okay, there are 360,000 people born every day.
In Pamplona, I have thousands of boys born on May 5th,
including lots and lots of Pedros.
What about Simon?
Peter was born Simon, son of John.
Before Christ anointed him as one of his disciples.
Ka-ching, Simon Alonso,
born May 5, 1983,
西蒙·阿隆索
Christened by Father Consolmango,
the only son of Xavi and Delores Alonso.
He ended up working at Foto Navarre,
a photo booth in the old city a couple years back.
That's where they post the photos of the day's runs.
He could have seen each one of our victims from there.
Address is on its way to you now.
Help me!
Three years ago,
a global advocacy group headed
by American and Australian animal rights activists
snuck onto the Alonso's ranch
and freed their prized bulls.
Now, in the resulting chaos, two people were gored to death,
including one of the activists.
Because of this, the family's bulls were slaughtered.
Why are we just finding out about this now?
The Alonso breed is a very respected,
ancient bloodline.
Now, they're a prominent family,
so they successfully lobbied to keep the incident quiet.
Not to mention, the story was eclipsed
by a factory fire that killed 100 people the next day.
The destruction of the family's herd
could have been the cause of our unsub's stressor.
Yeah, the loss of a family business.
Their social standing could have sent our unsub into a tailspin.
Excuse me, have you seen this man?
No.
No.
No, no.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Jack!
Where is he holding his victims?
He says they're dead.
All the victims are dead.
Every man fan out, cordon off this area.
Treat this as an active crime scene.
He said he couldn't protect his family.
I don't know.
Ramblings of a madman.
Who we'll now put behind bars
Thanks to you and your team.
My men will find out what he's done with the bodies.
Gracias, Agent Garrett.
Great work.
Jack? What is it?
All the physical evidence says we got our guy,
but something's bothering me.
We profiled this unsub as a matador --
dominant, statement-driven.
The guy we just arrested isn't either.
He did lack the confidence
you'd expect from such an offender.
But he expressed guilt. He confessed to the priest.
Yeah, but we did say he'd need a place
that was secluded to hold his victims while he tortured them,
which that place definitely wasn't.
What if we're looking for a team,
with dominant to our submissive?
Esposito, he said that matadors have assistants,
people who work to weaken the bull before the final kill.
Yeah, but we were correct about the profile.
We were right about the stressor, it led us to Simon.
Which means we're looking for someone with a shared trauma.
Someone with significant influence over Simon.
They say that bullfighting is a family business.
Hey, Monty,
what happened to the rest of the Alonso family?
The Alonsos are no longer in Pamplona, a far as I can tell.
Delores Alonso passed away a year ago,
but Simon's father is completely off the grid,
although someone is still paying the mortgage
on an abandoned property the family owns,
The Alonso Bullfighting Ring.
That's it, the father.
Monty, get us everything you can
on the patriarch of the Alonso family.
Please...
Simon and his father were outcasts.
I wouldn't be surprised if they developed a siege mentality.
Keep your eyes open.
Please, let me go.
Wait, wait, wait.
Stand back.
Simmons.
He's -- he's feeding his victims to the bulls.
Got you now, huh?
Drop your weapon!
Bulls were kings!
They lived! They were gods!
You don't have to do this. This man is innocent.
Foreign bastards.
My bulls defined San Fermín!
My family no deserve this.
No!
We need to get an ambulance here immediately.
It's okay.
Father.
You caught the man responsible?
Father, in my line of work,
I see the worst humanity has to offer.
Chaos and death,
it can be hard to remember the good.
Sometimes it's tough to have faith in people, in institutions.
In God.
You feel called to intervene in the face of injustice.
That in and of itself is an act of faith.
A good shepherd always looks out for his flock.
The book of "Amos" tells us,
"Let justice roll on like a river."
"And righteousness like a never-falling stream."
Amen.
Thank you, Father.
