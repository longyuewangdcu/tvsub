Victor made himself perfectly clear.</i>
Whenever I've truly wanted something, I've always gotten it.
Bree needed to get away.</i>
We're finally taking our honeymoon.
Susan couldn't wait to pop the question.</i>
Will you marry me?
Lynette received shocking news.</i>
You can see this. It could be lymphoma.
Why are you reluctant to make a commit to me?
Because I'm not in love with you.
Edie...</i>
What if we tried to have a baby?
engaged in a dangerous deception.</i>
When Gabrielle Solis agreed to marry Victor Lang,</i>
she was determined to have a very traditional wedding.</i>
She was even more determined to be a very traditional bride.</i>
To that end, the handkerchief in her cleavage was borrowed,</i>
the garter on her leg was blue</i>
and the diamonds on her ears were old.</i>
But sadly for Gabrielle, something was missing.</i>
And she was about to throw a traditional fit.</i>
It is after three!
Where the hell is Bree with my something new?
I know her plane landed on time.
She'll probably be here any second.
I should have my head examined for agreeing to this.
Who the hell cares about Swiss jewelry anyway?
Gabby, Bree went out of her way to buy you that bracelet.
Of course it's the hottest day of the year.
All the guests are out there sweating like pigs.
On this rate, my reception's going to look like
the finish line of the Boston Marathon.
If you're that freaked out, get married without the bracelet.
Are you out of your mind?
Can't get married without my "something new."
Oh, I have an idea. I just got a lipstick yesterday.
You could wear that.
I just paid a makeup artist 500 bucks to do my face.
Do you think I want to march down the aisle
looking like I ate a popsicle?
OK, it's your big day, so I'm gonna let that slide.
God, it is ten after, and Bree is never late!
Where can she be?
All right, that's it.
After I finish zhuzhing my hair,
tell the preacher it's showtime.
I can't believe my wedding's already ruined
and it hasn't even started.
I am starting to get worried about Bree.
Maybe we should call.
Yeah, I'm calling her cell.
It's ringing.
Oh, good.
Bree!
Hello, ladies.
Is that Bree?
She better not have come empty-handed.
Oh, I didn't.
As promised, Bree had arrived with something new.</i>
Holy crap.
And she also... brought the bracelet.</i>
Family. There is nothing more important.</i>
They are the ones we want to laugh with</i>
during the good times.</i>
And the ones we need to console us during the bad.</i>
And even though the time comes</i>
when they have to leave us...</i>
... their voices still linger in our minds.</i>
And, sometimes, we can't help but listen.</i>
Tangled web. That's what you're weaving.
Oh, beat it, Mother.
Really think this scheme of yours is gonna work?
Of course it will. Look at him.
He's practically in love with me already.
That's because he thinks you're gonna give him a baby.
Wait till he finds out you're still on the pill.
Shut up, would you?
I just thank the good Lord your father didn't live to see this.
Well, neither did you!
You died alone in a trailer park watching game shows.
And why should I listen to you?
'Cause I know what's waiting for you, missy.
This one's gonna leave you like all the others.
You're going to end up old and alone, just like I did.
Carlos? Carlos!
Down here, babe!
I'm making you a fruit smoothie.
Chicken or fish?
What?
I haven't gotten your reply card. Chicken or fish?
Oh, right, your wedding. I can't go.
Why not?
I'm a jinx. Look how your last marriage turned out.
Come on, Gabby, we both know it'd be weird if I went.
OK, maybe a little. But it'll be weirder if you don't.
Excuse me?
Look, everyone knows you living with Edie.
If she shows up alone,
people'll think I asked her not to bring you,
like it bugs me you guys are together.
Well it does. But, you hit the roof when you found out.
Which is why I have to show people that I'm OK with it!
Please. Just consider it my wedding gift.
OK. But I'm skipping the ceremony.
What? And just go to the reception? You can't do that!
Well, I don't want to make a scene.
You'll vow "till death do us part," I'll bust out laughing,
people will stare...
The reception starts at four.
I'm thinking a chocolate fountain would
be a cool centerpiece to a dessert buffet.
Dessert buffet? We're having a wedding cake, right?
Isn't that dessert?
You have to give people a choice.
Don't you think a chocolate fountain'd be elegant?
I don't know. You, a big white dress, melted chocolate.
Am I the only one hearing alarm bells?
Fine, we'll skip the chocolate.
How about a champagne fountain?
Oh, I know.
We can make the champagne flow through the ice sculpture.
Don't you think we might be going over the top?
Mike, these are all fairly standard wedding features.
Now you name one thing that you think is going over the top.
How about the dove wrangler?
The doves are not going to release themselves.
Do we really need 40 of them?
OK, I know that you think that I'm being silly,
but all of our friends went to Bree's wedding,
and now Gabby's. Two months from now,
do we want them thinking ours wasn't as nice?
It seems to me our friends wouldn't be there to make
petty comparisons.
They'd be there to celebrate our love.
You would think that, but no.
Come on, this is something that
we have both looked forward to for so long.
Don't you want it to be perfect?
Oh, I guess. About the doves, though.
What?
You in a wedding gown, 40 birds circling overhead?
Again, not liking those odds.
Oh, it's not as bad as it sounds.
It's Hodgkin's Lymphoma
and, apparently, if you're going to get lymphoma,
that's the kind you want.
Hey, you want to hold it down up there, kids?
I'm trying to talk to your Aunt Lucy! Thank you.
Anyway, I know I said that
we would come and visit you this June,
but I'll be a little woozy and bald from the chemo, so...
Oh, thanks for understanding. Oh, one more thing.
Our insurance policy has a really high deductible,
so we are strapped financially,
and I was wondering if maybe you and Dave
might be able to...
Oh, really?
No, I am not asking Mom.
She doesn't know about any of this,
so don't you tell her, OK?
We'll be fine. I love you. Bye.
I take it that's a no on the loan.
Yep, Dave lost his job at the plant,
and he is now handing out fliers
at a chicken restaurant and, prepare to wince,
there is a chicken suit involved.
Where are we gonna find this $10,000?
You leave that to me.
I want you to focus on getting better.
But honey...
I will find it.
Meanwhile, we'll make some sacrifices around here.
My tennis club membership is up this month.
I'm not renewing.
Should you be playing tennis after your back surgery?
Probably not.
Well, in that spirit,
as soon as I start chemo, I will be giving up shampoo.
OK, thanks. Taxi's here.
Are you sure you're ready to go back?
We could wait another week.
And miss Gabby's wedding? No, I'll be fine.
Is this the dress you were thinking for the ceremony?
Yes.
Oh, good. I'll fold it in tissue so it doesn't wrinkle.
Oh, darling. I don't deserve you.
Oh, come on, we agreed, no more tears.
I'm so sorry to be putting you through this.
I wouldn't blame you if you ran like hell
and never looked back.
Stop.
I'm going to raise this child and love it as if it were my own.
Now, let's see a smile.
Glad you could join us, Milton.
It's good to get to know you before the wedding.
Thank you. You know, I must say,
All these months,
I thought Victor was exaggerating about you
but he hasn't done you justice.
You, my dear, are a flawless beauty.
I'm hardly flawless.
I'm sure I have a blemish hidden away somewhere.
That's a search I'd relish.
She is way out of your league, Dad.
Honey, he's a multimillionaire.
He runs my league.
By the way, Victor Lang, I ran into Keith Perkinson last week.
How is the venerable state chairman?
Impressed with you.
He liked the way you ran your mayor campaign.
Said if you keep your numbers up,
he might consider supporting you
in the next governor's race.
Really?
What's so funny?
You've got to be kidding, right?
I mean, we just finished a campaign.
You're not about to put me through another one.
But I thought you loved campaigning.
God, no. It's a complete snore.
Pasting a smile on my face
while you say the same speech for the 50th time.
But you were a natural. People loved you.
Well, the feeling wasn't mutual.
You think I enjoyed sipping tea with these
frumpy matrons who wore loud poly-blend pantsuits?
Do you know how many times I wanted to scream,
"Vote for my husband, you colorblind cow!"
I think you've discovered something
very important about democracy.
The nation is full of fools, and everyone gets a vote.
They're not gonna get us again.
I made nice with Fairview,
I'm not about to suck up to the whole damn state.
What are you doing?
Some guy out in Mount Pleasant's
got a cracked water heater.
It's three in the morning.
Well, I started advertising as a 24-hour plumber.
After midnight, I get triple time.
OK, that's crazy.
You can't work around the clock. It's not healthy.
This is the third night I've worked this week.
I'm fine so far.
You've been sneaking out while I've been asleep?
What are you, ninja plumber?
It's just for a little while, to earn some extra money.
Is this about the wedding?
We agreed we want it to be nice.
But we didn't agree on this.
Maybe I can scale things back a bit.
How? Have a ginger ale fountain?
Make paper doves and hope it's windy?
OK, seriously, you don't have to kill yourself.
I could max out my credit card.
Is that really how you want to start our life together, in debt?
No, I want to start out happy.
But clearly, you're upset, and I don't know why.
I'm not Ian.
I can't afford to move you into a mansion
or fly you off to Paris.
But I'll be damned if I don't give you
the same dream wedding he'd have given you.
I'll see you in the morning.
Where the hell do you get off having cancer
and not telling me about it?
Mom.
How do you think you could handle this without me?
Stella?
Oh, there's my Tommy-boy. Come here.
Oh, God.
Oh, listen, be a love, will you, honey,
and get my bags from the cab.
Bags? She's staying?
Yep. And do not tip the driver. SOB wouldn't let me smoke.
Jeez, Lynette, I didn't know you opened a daycare center.
Hey, kids, Grandma's here.
OK, what did you tell them about me?
It's been five years, Mom. They don't remember you.
They'll remember me this time, I brought presents.
Cool!
For you, and you and you.
These are baby toys. We're too old to play with these.
I'm too old to remember what the hell six-year-olds like.
We're eight!
What do I care?
Just say "thank you."
Thank you.
Oh, who's the pretty thing? Your girlfriend?
No! She's my sister!
Is that Tom's little b-a-s-t-a...?
OK, kids! Time to get your toys and play upstairs.
Come on, sweetie.
Let's go, everybody.
Listen, I really appreciate you coming to help,
but as you can see, I'm perfectly fine.
For now.
How are you gonna handle that mob
when you're flat on your ass from chemo?
I'll manage.
You got through breast cancer
while raising the three of us alone.
I was not alone. I had you.
Lynette was all of 13, and she still looked after her sisters,
cleaned the house, cooked the meals,
and I was curled up in a ball,
puking my guts out.
That's what you get when you mix chemo and vodka gimlets.
You can goad me all you like, Lynette.
I did not come here to fight.
Now trust me, cookie.
I have memorized the whole catalogue of subjects
you and I can no longer discuss.
If that means that
we have to talkabout the weather for three months, then fine.
But I am staying.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I have to go kick a child out of its room.
OK, legs up.
Oh, you want to do it again?
No. I've been doing a lot of research,
and gravity helps facilitate the sperm reaching the eggs.
So heave-ho!
Could we try a little light spooning
before you hang me like a side of beef?
Edie, we're trying to have a baby.
Well, could we be a little less clinical?
Maybe let nature take its course.
Nature is not on our side anymore.
You're no spring chicken
and those eggs aren't exactly farm fresh.
OK, stop referring to me as poultry!
Sorry. Can we just try this? It's only for 30 minutes.
30 minutes! I am not staying in this position for half an hour!
Listen, I know that this requires some work,
but it will all be worth it
when we have our beautiful, beautiful baby, right?
Right. I guess I could make some sacrifices.
That's my girl.
Can I get you anything?
Yeah, I'd kill for a beer.
Sorry. No alcohol.
What? For how long?
Just until the baby's born. Oh, and you stop nursing.
Don't worry, I'll get you a nice herbal tea.
Just for a few months, while you're in treatment.
We're gonna have to find someone to watch the kids.
No! I am not leaving that woman in charge of our children.
In three months, the twins will be chain-smoking
and Penny will be an alcoholic.
We can manage. We've got McCluskey.
She costs money. Money we won't have
if we pay someone to replace you at work.
You said not to worry about money,
you'd find it somewhere.
I did.
What? Someone loaned us $10,000?
No, gave us. And we can't thank her by kicking her out.
No! Tom, you didn't ask my mother!
Didn't have to.
She knew that you hit up Lucy, so she offered.
Well, we're giving it back.
No, we can't afford to.
Tom, you don't know half the stuff she did to us.
She would get drunk and smack us around.
She would meet some new guy,
and then drop us off at her sister's for a week
for a week because he wasn't into kids.
OK, so she was a crappy mom.
You said yourself that she has mellowed.
Now she wants to make amends.
If you would just try to understand.
I think that I've been pretty understanding lately.
What's that supposed to mean?
I think you know.
Great, so in the middle of everything I'm dealing with,
you're gonna throw Rick in my face?
When someone we love hurts us, if we still love them,
we deal with it and we move on.
If I can do it, so can you.
So forgiving my mother, that's my penance?
Yeah. I think it is.
You said we weren't supposed to spend
the night before the wedding together.
Yeah, I was trying to respect tradition,
but I got horny.
I guess we'll have to start the honeymoon early, won't we?
Let me get rid of this stuff.
What are you working on so late?
Nothing.
Polling data? Why are you polling? The election's over.
Just a little research. God, you look hot.
Is this about running for governor?
Beacause I told you how I feel about that.
My dad just set up a little exploratory committee.
It's no big deal.
OK, let's explore it now.
Nope. Not gonna happen.
Gabby.
Victor, ever since we met,
it's been photo ops and fundraisers,
and I'm sick of it!
I'm a politician.
Do you think I want my career
to begin and end in the suburbs?
Fairview's home. Don't want to leave it!
You can't make this decision without me!
I'm gonna be your wife.
Exactly! Not my career advisor.
I don't even get a vote?
Not if it's a veto!
OK, look, no!
I already married a man who put his career before me,
and I swore I wasn't going to again.
I swore I would not let a stupid woman hold me back!
That did not come out the way I wanted it to.
I'm sorry. I'm sor... I'm really sorry.
I've been under a lot of pressure lately.
Well, here's one less thing you have to worry about:
our wedding.
You can't cancel the wedding. It's too late.
As far as I'm concerned, it's just in the nick of time.
Good morning, Gabby.
God, Milton, the newspaper's not even here yet.
I'm sorry it's so early. I just came to apologize.
Why? What happened wasn't your fault.
That's not exactly the case.
Is that coffee I smell?
You only bolted because Victor wants to be governor.
He only wants to be governor because of me.
You only suggested it.
You can't make him go after something he doesn't want.
The hell I can't.
Ever since he was a kid, Victor's been killing himself
trying to live up to his big-shot father.
He's desperate for my approval.
Why?
I suppose because he's never gotten it.
Everything he does, even becoming mayor,
I somehow let him know that it's not quite enough.
Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm right to push.
That's why he's so successful.
So, what are you saying,
I should marry Victor because you're a withholding father?
No, I just want you to understand why he does what he does.
Fine. I get it. But why would I want a husband who values
his father's opinion more than mine?
Well, he doesn't really care much what I think anymore.
After you left last night he called me and, what's the phrase,
"tore me a new one."
He did?
He said, because of me,
he'd lost the best thing that had ever happened to him.
And if he couldn't win you back,
I could take my money and buy a new son
because I was never going to be hearing from him again.
He blew off 80 million?
Well, if he cares about me so damn much,
why am I not hearing this from him?
I think you're about to.
Is there a back way out of here?
Aren't you going to be late for Gabby's wedding?
Oh, weddings are boring. I like to sneak in at the end,
look teary-eyed and pretend I was there the whole time.
I am going to see you at the reception.
Oh! Uh, hi, Danny.
Carlos, the paper boy's here! Could you pay him?
Come on in.
Hey. Here you go, Danny.
Oh, looks like I'm a little short.
Can I catch you later?
No.
All right, hold on.
Oh, my God.
What's that?
It's birth control pills.
I'm gonna need cash.
Welcome home.
I have missed you, sweetheart.
Here, allow me.
Well, hello there, Julie.
You guys are back!
Wow, somebody's blonder.
Oh, yeah, my mom hates it too.
So where's Danielle?
Well, while we were in Switzerland
she ran across this boarding school.
She fell in love with it and just insisted that we
let her spend a year abroad.
She must be having a good time.
She hasn't returned any of my phone calls.
Oh, well, you know, her school's up in the mountains
and her cell phone reception is kind of funky.
She hasn't answered my e-mails either.
I am going to call her tonight and have a little talk with her
about common courtesy and I'm sure that you'll get
an e-mail tomorrow morning.
Well, we should go.
Got to get that bracelet to Gabby before the wedding.
Well, I'll see you guys there. Bye.
Well, that was uncomfortable.
You have no idea.
Everyone's been asking questions.
This might not be as easy as we'd hoped.
There. Now you have something new.
So how do I look?
You are now, officially,
the most beautiful bride that ever lived.
Until your wedding, of course.
Nice save.
It means so much to me that
we're all here together right now.
And break!
Love you.
We are gathered here today to join together...
... Victor Lang and Gabrielle Marquez in matrimony.
An honorable estate not to be entered into lightly,
but reverently and soberly.
This is a lifetime union, based on love, honor, and trust.
Do you wanna be my new best friend.
Premium scotch. Keep it coming.
You are promising not only to give it to yourself,
but also to accept each other
Promising not only to love for today, but to extend that love..
Carlos! I thought you weren't coming until...
Save it!
OK, look, I can explain.
Don't bother!
Your lies were more convincing when I cared.
Carlos! You've got to understand!
I do want to have a baby with you, just not yet!
I just wanted to give you a chance to fall in love with me first.
I don't believe you. And I will never trust you again.
Well, what was I supposed to do?
You backed me into a corner!
And you were gonna bail on us.
I was just trying to save what we had!
Carlos, don't leave me.
Please just talk to me.
I am done with you.
Carlos!
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you,
Mr. and Mrs. Victor Lang!
I'm sorry!
Mrs. McCluskey. Enjoy the wedding?
Nice. Very classy.
What the hell was that brouhaha between Carlos and Edie?
I don't know and I don't care.
Today I am so filled with love, I can forgive anyone anything.
Oh, but if you do see them again, call security.
So we're in Zuich and I am sick after breakfast
for the third morning in a row. I thought to myself,"Dear God,
"I hope I haven't developed an allergy to chocolate brioche."
"Life wouldn't be worth living."
I said, "That's it, we're seeing a doctor."
You could've knocked us over with a feather when he said
she was two months pregnant.
I think it's so great and we could not be happier for you.
When's your due date?
Not until the early fall,
but enough about me. This is your day. You and Victor.
Who, by the way, I have not met yet.
My gosh, that's right.
OK, you stay here, I'm going to go grab him.
It's so good to be back.
I can't believe how much is happening.
I mean, you and Gabby getting married,
and I'm having a baby.
What's going on with you, Lynette?
Nothing. Same old, same old.
Really? Everything OK, sweetie?
You haven't seemed yourself the last couple weeks.
I'm fine. Everything's just fine.
I'll tell you this much, I'm exhausted.
I'll be glad when this day's over.
Well, it was all worth it.
Marrying Gabby is the smartest thing you've ever done.
Her bringing the Latino vote,
the governor's mansion's yours.
Well, that's assuming I can change her mind.
Had to make concessions to get her down the aisle.
Well, you're the husband now. The rules have changed.
Be nice, buy her a few pretty things.
Trust me, you'll be able to tame that little spitfire.
Not worried. I've always been able to manage my assets.
Did you find him?
No. I'm still looking, but I'll let you know.
Movie's over, amen.
Go out and play. Go on. Out.
They're just gonna go play guns.
Can I watch another movie?
Lynette said one was the limit and she'll be home soon.
No, she won't.
Whenever they go out to a party
they always come home at least an hour later
than they say they will.
Aren't you an observant little monkey.
Tell me, sweetie,
would you know anything about a man named Rick?
Yeah, I know Rick.
My daddy and Lynette had a big fight about him.
Really?
Sounds like there's, maybe, a little story there.
If I tell you, could I watch a really good grown-up movie?
If it's a really good grown-up story.
OK, I got you some appetizers to tide you over.
We have mini-quiches and beef satay
and something called Crystal Coast shrimp with grits,
but it's mostly grits
because I ate all the shrimp on my way over.
Mike?
Reverend, that was such a beautiful ceremony.
Really just heartfelt and moving. The whole package.
Well, thank you.
It was really impressive.
So, what are you doing tonight?
Carlos. I didn't know you were in here.
I got a little thirsty.
Yes, I can see that.
Gaby, I am sorry if I ruined your wedding.
But if it's any consolation, I also ruined my life.
What are you talking about?
A couple years ago I was totally happy.
I had a home, you, a great career.
And I don't understand how I let it all go to hell.
And now, here I am, back at square one.
I really blew it.
What am I doing?
I shouldn't be dumping this on you.
It's your wedding day. Go to Victor.
I'm going to stay right here...
Well, I don't know how you did it.
The kids are asleep.
The cough syrup hasn't been touched.
Boy, you're just waiting for an excuse to give me the boot.
Well, if history's any indicator, I won't have to wait long.
So you don't think people can change?
I think, at a certain point, people just are who they are.
Well, I think people can change.
Now take you. You were the perfect wife and mom.
Then along came Rick.
How did you...?
Come on, Lynette.
You kids're young when I was sneaking around on glamor,
but you knew something was up.
You heard about this from my kids?
Just the girl.
And all she knows is that,
"Daddy got mad because Rick liked you."
Nothing happened between me and Rick.
Yes, he came on to me, but unlike you,
I controlled myself.
Well, you had Tom to come home to.
I had your stepfather.
Hey, Glen may have bored you,
but the years we had a father
in that house were the happiest of my life.
You didn't care about that though,did you?
You just drove him away.
And you couldn't wait to pay me back!
Do you remember what you said the next year?
When I got sick?
No, I don't.
Liar.
You said I earned it.
It was God's punishment.
How are you feeling now, Lynette?
You think you're being punished?
How can you say that?
You were so sanctimonious.
You could not imagine what
sort of woman could do that kind of thing.
Not so hard to imagine now, is it?
Stop comparing us. I never did what you did.
No, you just wanted to.
You're leaving tomorrow. I don't want your money.
I don't want you in my house.
Hey! You are sick, Lynette.
You think you know what you're in for
'cause you watched me go through it?
Watching it is nothing.
You're gonna feel worse than you thought a person'd feel,
and I'll be holding your hand through every damn minute.
You can't stay if I don't want you here.
You can fight me or you can fight the cancer.
Trust me, you won't have the strength to do both.
Andrew, do young people still say "Awesome"?
Not so much. Try "Off the hook."
"Off the hook"? That doesn't make sense.
Fine. Type in "Groovy." See if I care.
Hello. Hodge residence.
Oh, hi, Danielle.
Listen, I am sending Julie Mayer an e-mail from you.
Now would you say that your school was "off the hook"?
No. I would say it was "Sucky,"
or "Crappy," Or "A freaking nightmare."
Mom, you have got to talk to the nuns.
They are so harsh with me.
And they have all these stupid rules.
If you're still gonna complain, I'm going to hang up.
Well, perhaps some of the rules had been in place
when you took up with Edie's nephew,
you might not be in this pickle.
Mom, please, I just want to come home.
Look, I am gonna say this one last time.
You are gonna stay put until that baby is born.
Now, don't forget, we're driving up this weekend
and I am bringing your favorite, lemon squares. And...
Darling, can I draw you a bath?
Oh, that would be lovely.
Oh, would you give me a hand, please?
There you go.
It's almost the time for the six-month size.
Oh, don't remind me.
No. No, it's no problem. I can fix that for you.
Just give me your name and address.
I'm Mrs. Emmeline Walcott and I'm at 42 Old Mill Road.
I've got to stop and pick up a Douglas valve,
but I should be there in 45 minutes tops.
I hate to see you drive when you're this tired.
There's some iced coffee in the fridge.
I'll be fine.
See you when I get back.
You were great.
Did you all ever doubt I would be?
Just hurry up and get dressed.
We only have 45 minutes!
OK.
Are you Mike?
Yeah. I'm looking for a Mrs. Walcott's house.
You've come to the right place. Here, put this on.
You mind telling me what Susan's up to?
Ask her yourself.
Hello.
Are you sure about this?
I don't want you to look back
and regret not having your perfect wedding.
I don't know if you've noticed,
but my idea of a perfect wedding keeps changing.
One day I want white roses and then I want lilies.
First I want a harpist and then a string quartet.
Only one thing stays constant...
...and I'm looking at him.
Why'd I need anything else to make my wedding perfect?
Well, who knew downsizing could be so romantic?
Mrs. Walcott, I presume?
That's right, sugar.
You might want to check that breast pocket of your suit.
Just so you know, you'll be paying for those
and the lights and the flowers.
I've never seen you look so beautiful.
You clean up pretty good yourself.
Are we ready?
Are you kidding?
They've been dragging this out for three years.
We are gathered here today to join together
Mike Delfino and Susan Mayer in matrimony.
An honorable estate not to be entered into lightly,
but reverently and soberly.
Family. There is nothing more important.</i>
They are the ones who show up when we're in trouble.</i>
The ones who push us to succeed.</i>
The ones who help keep our secrets.</i>
But what of those who have no family to rely on?</i>
What happens to those poor souls,</i>
who have no loved ones to help them in their hour of need?</i>
Well, most learn to walk life's road by themselves...</i>
... but a sad few of us...</i>
... simply stop trying.</i>
