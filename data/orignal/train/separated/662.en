So Charlotte Grayson is your sister?
What are you gonna do with the tapes?
I've gotta get rid of Amanda.
but I think it's best if you go back to your mother's.
Emily Thorne, will you marry me?
Yes.
What the hell are you doing?
The Graysons hired that guy who beat up Jack.
Go to save yourself.
I'm gonna need your old cell phone.
Where's Amanda?
She's gone, Jack.
Your mom said David Clarke raped her?
You still want to marry into my crazy family?
More than ever.
Years ago,
I met a boy who introduced me to a book,
"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell."
In it, William Blake writes,
"If the doors of perception were cleansed,
"everything would appear to man as it is...
infinite."
But in reality, our perception is often clouded...
By expectations...
By experiences.
As of late, I find my perception is blinded by only one thing...
revenge.
Things aren't what they seem.
I can promise you,
Victoria Grayson had nothing to do with my arrest.
If anything, she's another victim.
The father of her child is in prison,
and she's being forced to raise our baby with the man
I believe put me here.
Mom?
Did you see the invitation?
It's gorgeous.
You okay?
I'm just pleased to have you back.
You're upset about the engagement, aren't you?
It's just an engagement. Anything can happen.
What would you like for breakfast?
I already ate.
Well, lunch then.
I'm having lunch with Declan,
the other one you don't exactly approve of.
But they can't all be Graysons, can they?
Your mother requested white for the engagement photos.
What do you think?
I think, I'm one lucky guy.
You look gorgeous.
You sure you're ready for all this?
Well, it's too late to turn back now.
The invitations are already out.
I'll see you at the photo shoot.
Okay.
Six months ago,
Victoria gave birth to a baby girl.
Her name is Charlotte.
You want proof that I'm telling the truth?
Ask her who the father is?
Good morning, Nolan.
"Fire&Ice." Mm. Subtle.
Was fire and brimstone not available?
I didn't check.
What happened to pressing pause and regrouping?
Victoria told Daniel that my father raped her.
That that's how she became pregnant with Charlotte.
Wow. She threw a dead man under the bus?
She's certainly committed.
So am I.
You're thinking of going wide about Charlotte's paternity,
aren't you?
Just waiting for the perfect moment.
And you're not worried at all about
how that might affect your little sis?
One way or another, she's gonna find out.
I want it to be my way.
You might want to give that some second thought.
Last time you had it your way,
Jack ended up with three cracked ribs and a broken heart.
His wounds will heal in time.
I'm just happy that he's finally out of this.
Good-bye, Nolan.
All right. Just over here, boys.
Yeah, yeah, around the corner. Yep, just in that room.
There you go.
All right, now careful, careful, careful.
Ah, special delivery for my good buddy Jack,
help ease the pain.
What am I supposed to do with that?
Watch larger-than-life porn,
uh, jumbo "Judge Judy,"
your choice.
Holy crap.
That's very generous, but we don't need it.
Oh, yeah, we do. I-I mean,
if you can't return it, then...
Dec, show the guys where to put it.
Look, this came for you today.
I know you're already in pain,
so I thought I'd just pile it all on at once.
Sorry.
Um, I guess, follow me.
All right.
Careful, guys.
You knew Amanda's family, right?
Just her father.
Any idea where she might have gone?
No clue.
Wait. I don't need to give you
"The other fish in the sea" talk, do I?
Because you're basically a fisherman.
Amanda's different.
In her note,
she said she left because trouble follows her.
I think she thinks she was the reason I got beat up.
I need to find her, tell her it wasn't her fault.
Jack...
What you need to do is rest.
Just rest, buddy.
So...
Fire & Ice?
It's astonishing how your mother managed
to model the theme of your engagement party
after both sides of her own personality.
You told me to ask mom about the secret she's been hiding.
Well, she told me.
What did she tell you exactly?
The truth.
That David Clarke
is Charlotte's biological father,
and everything she's been through
having to carry a terrible secret like that.
Wait a minute. Everything she's been through?
Come on, Daniel.
If you're this easily manipulated by your mother,
I shudder to think what Emily is gonna do to you
as your wife.
So the rumors are true?
Grandpa. How you doing?
I heard you went out and got yourself engaged.
Ah. Can't wait to meet the lovely lady.
As one marriage begins,
I understand, another one's coming to an end.
Dad.
Vicky called me.
Of course she did.
The idea was to keep our separation discreet.
But what the heck?
Give us a moment, will you, Dan?
Oh, sure.
You're in hot water, boy.
I shouldn't have to tell you what a negative impact
a hostile divorce can have on our company's bottom line,
especially if our assets
are forced into a public tug-of-war
between you and your old lady.
Well, I've got that situation well in hand.
From what she told me, your life's in a free fall.
You're on the verge
of taking a wrecking ball to the Grayson name,
my name.
That is from Victoria, I assume?
Your source has her own agenda, pops.
Precisely why I'm here.
I didn't build my empire from the ground up
so I could watch your domestic failure
single handedly tear it down.
It's Amanda. You know what to do.
Amanda... It's Jack.
Again.
I just found something that belongs to you.
Actually, it looks like it belongs to the guy
whose house you apparently torched.
I don't know if you're checking these messages anymore
or if you're just deleting them, but, uh...
If you want your tape back,
you're gonna have to meet with me face-to-face.
I'm sick of being played.
I deserve answers.
第一季 第十四集
How the hell did this happen?
How did Jack get his hands on that tape?
Victoria's henchman must have missed it.
And if you're gonna say I told you so, don't.
All right. Well, what's on it, anyway?
Depends on what tape it is.
It could be nothing or it could be a pandora's box.
I don't know.
I'll get it.
Well, you've done enough damage.
I don't want to see Jack get hurt again.
What you think I do?
I think you're so busy looking down the road,
that you lost sight of us mere mortals long ago.
The photographer's ready.
Is that the L'Wren Scott? It's perfect.
Oh, and I spoke to Carolina Herrera,
And she said, she would be thrilled
to make your dress for the engagement party.
I was thinking drop waist, off the shoulder.
Ashley, personal question.
Are you close with your family?
Not particularly.
My father wasn't around much.
Mm. Well, I didn't know my father at all.
It's one of my deepest regrets.
I think growing up without someone to protect you from the world
forces you to learn how to survive in it.
Well, that's something we both have in common.
Let's get another light reading.
We're coming off a little...
Charlotte,look at you.
You know, the last photographs I have of the two of us
are from Martha's vineyard...
Beautiful.
Ages ago.
Nice.
We used to spend so much time together
when Daniel was away at Harvard.
What happened?
The prodigal son returned.
What's say you and I go out after this,
just the two of us?
I already told you, I have plans with Declan.
Well, then how about the three of us?
I'd like to get to know Declan better, and...
smooth over any awkwardness between us.
Oh, you mean after you tried to bribe him to leave me alone?
That's kinda hard to smooth out, mom.
I am trying, Charlotte.
I am.
Okay, who's next?
Me. I am.
let's, uh, cue up a little music.
See if we can get everybody in the mood to get their smile on.
Hey, Ems.
You know it's not fair to keep her in the dark.
You need to tell her.
Your sister's in a delicate place right now,
with the divorce and her father.
This has to be handled properly.
Great. Beautiful.
But you are gonna handle it, aren't you?
Because if it were me, I'd want to know.
What hurts more is finding out you've been lied to.
Okay, okay, the groom.
Come over here.
How you holding up?
Better now that you're here.
Sorry I'm late.
Grandpa Grayson ambushed my dad at the Southfork.
Apparently, my mother called him.
What do you think's going on?
I don't know.
But he's always had a soft spot for my mom more than my dad.
Daniel, just put your arm around her and act natural.
Nothing about this is natural.
Then try the other arm.
Think about the first time you laid your eyes on each other.
"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell" By William Blake.
William Blake, the poet.
I know who that is. I took brit lit last semester.
All right. Very good. Listen.
"If the doors of perception were cleansed,
everything would appear to man as it is,
infinite."
And that applies to you how?
Infinite freedom.
That's what I want.
I'm weighed down by my father's expectations,
my mother's disapproving eye,
but mostly by the world's perception
of what it means to be a Grayson.
I don't want to be limited by all that for the rest of my life.
That's it. That's what I'm looking for.
Beautiful. Great.
What were you thinking?
I was just thinking about the moment that...
I knew you were the one.
Oh, that's nice. Yeah.
Daddy.
I knew you'd come.
Well, it's a family portrait, isn't it?
And this is still my family.
Hey, I want to take a picture with dad.
Great.
In a minute. I just need to talk to your mother.
Let's set one up with Charlotte and her father.
You know what? Forget it.
I'm going to lunch.
Mom, if you'd still like to join me and Declan,
I'd love that.
I would be delighted.
Join me in the study, would you?
How about we try one over by the railing?
How dare you drag my father into this.
I was simply telling him about the engagement party.
Oh, the hell you were.
We'll settle all of this tonight at dinner.
He'll be here at 8:00.
Well, I won't be.
Of course you will.
And you will use this evening as a platform
to show that our separation is civil and fair,
Ensuring your father's confidence
in your ongoing leadership of Grayson Global.
Or?
Or...
I can make it an apocalyptic showcase
of just how ugly things have become and how much worse they can get.
What do you want, Victoria?
I want you to resume acting like
a compassionate father to Charlotte,
to agree never to reveal to her her true paternity,
and to settle this divorce fairly and out of court.
Is that all?
For now.
Hey, skipper.
What you got?
You're an A.V. Geek, right?
You know what that is?
Dinosaur format.
What do I need to watch it?
Well, why don't I just take it back to my lab?
And, uh, I'll see what I can do.
I'll hold on to that.
Jack...
You--you seem tightly wound.
I mean, I can't help but notice Amanda's name on that.
A sex tape?
No. Just find me a player.
As you know, Grandpa Grayson is in town,
and I would love for the two of you
to join us for dinner tonight.
I would be remissed if I didn't mention how important it is
for all of us, despite recent events,
to put forth our best effort
and welcome him into our happy home.
What was that about?
That looked an awful lot like my mother getting what she wants.
You know what? This is Nolan.
I've been putting him off all day. I've gotta get it.
All right. I'm gonna get changed.
Okay.
Okay.
Ashley, I'll be back in a minute.
Did you find the tape?
Jack won't let it out of his sight.
I could erase it if I dig up my degausser.
But there's no guarantee he won't watch it before then.
Okay, do you know the number that was on the tape?
14. Why? You know what's on it?
That was my interview with Treadwell when I was 10.
I've gotta get my hands on the tape.
I'll take it from here.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What are you gonna do?
Something I've been trying to avoid.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
I know you weren't happy with that photo shoot.
No, it w--it's not that.
It's just... I don't know.
Maybe tomorrow,
you, Daniel, and I can go out in the sunlight,
do something that's a bit more us.
That was my original concept.
This whole thing was Victoria's idea.
Yeah, it usually is.
Listen, I have a few things that I need to take care of.
Will you tell Daniel I had to go?
What kind of things?
Secret things.
Wedding things.
Hello.
I got your message, Jack.
I need that tape back.
That's it?
That's all you have to say to me?
Coastal Inn, Riverhead,
Room Six.
We'll talk when you get here.
Bring that tape.
I'm sorry to drag you back into this.
It's okay.
I was going crazy, not being able to talk to Jack.
How is he?
Does he miss me?
He's confused and upset by what happened,
which is why we need to stay focused on the bigger picture.
We can't let whatever's on that tape lead him to Victoria.
You know what she's capable of. You've seen it yourself.
Are you sure we're doing the right thing?
What if we just tell Jack the truth?
That you've been pretending to be me this whole time?
He'd never forgive you for that.
They just came in.
Hey, wish me luck.
Mrs. G. Thanks for joining us.
Thank you for having me, Declan.
It's like the beginning of a joke.
Two Graysons walk into a bar...
Well, perhaps we should have a drink before I hear the punch line.
Do you have a wine list?
We do. It's two wines long. Red or white.
How about a Bourbon On the Rocks?
Yeah, I'll put that order in with Bull.
I'll be right back.
Uh, this is weird for you, isn't it?
Well, believe it or not,
there's more to me than meets the eye.
Besides, I think it's important
to shake up one's perspective every once in a while.
That's why I'm interested in yours.
Good. Well, then can I invite Declan
to dinner with grandpa tonight?
Sweetheart, that's not a good idea.
It's very important to your father
that the evening go without a hitch.
Dad can hardly force a smile long enough
to take a picture with me.
He'll behave. I spoke to him.
It's open.
It's Victoria's pet bird.
She wanted to me to pick up
your list of invites for Fire&Ice.
Oh, well, unfortunately, it's incomplete.
My secretary is still working on the crossover
as Victoria and I are still socially intertwined.
Okay. I'll let Mrs. Grayson know.
What's your game, young lady?
I beg your pardon?
Well, you're too refined to be a grifter
and you're too smart to be a lackey.
So I suppose the polite word for it
would be opportunist.
So if it's opportunity you're looking for,
you're hitching your wagon to the wrong Grayson.
Oh, I know all about how Victoria treats her help.
I mean, you know, she keeps you at bay
and then she draws you in, gives you promises,
and as soon as you think she's gonna let you fly,
she clips your wings and puts you back in your cage.
I wouldn't settle for that
if I were you.
Why don't you have your secretary
e-mail me the list when you're ready, Mr. Grayson?
Did you bring the tape?
Hi to you, too.
Amanda.
Did you watch it?
Do I need to?
Don't I already know everything I need to know?
Some guy's house burns down,
another guy comes looking for his stolen property,
which I find in my house, left by you,
and I'm nearly beaten to death for it.
Was I just your alibi?
That spontaneous trip to Atlantic city,
suggested by you, was that not-so-spontaneous after all?
What do you want me to say, Jack?
I did it.
I'm a thief, an arsonist, and now a fugitive,
so call the cops if you want,
just give me the tape back.
Not until you tell me the truth.
Why'd you come back here?
Look at me.
Was it for me?
Was it for something else?
You want the whole truth, Jack?
Yeah.
The truth is, I've made mistakes.
I've pretended to be something I'm not.
And that little girl you loved,
she's not me.
Just give me the tape back.
No.
No, I'm keeping it.
I want to see what was worth
throwing everything we had away.
You need to go after him.
No!
I don't care what's on that tape,
I'm not doing that to him again.
We're doing it for him--
So you keep saying.
Amanda---
Stop calling me that.
You want that tape so bad, you get it from him.
I need you to call Jack and tell him
you found the equipment to view that video.
He wouldn't give it back to Amanda.
Poor Jack must really want answers
if not even the Long Island
Lolita could pry that tape from his death grip.
You never told me exactly what's on it.
What's the difference?
All Jack's gonna see is snow, right?
Is this the degausser?
Locked and ready to be loaded.
It'll erase any magnetic recording.
Though, why not just let him see the tape?
Seriously, Ems.
I mean, give the poor guy some closure
as to why Amanda Clarke
added criminal pyromania to her
already impressive list of felonies.
Because the only memory Jack should have
of Amanda Clarke
is the girl that I left behind.
Is that so he can move on...
Or so you can?
Never mind.
What's on the revengenda this evening, hmm?
Dinner with Daniel's grandfather.
I hear there's nothing
Grandpa Grayson likes less than a scandal.
Victoria used my father's reputation
to explain away Charlotte's existence.
Tonight I'm pitting her own lies against her.
Forgive me for being captain obvious.
But, uh, you do realize,
you're putting your own sister into the crosshairs again?
Charlotte deserves to know the truth.
The question is...
Who's gonna tell her?
That's simple.
Our father is.
Hi.
Hello.
There's a package in the doorway.
Thank you.
Hey, babe.
How were your secret errands?
All taken care of.
Come on. I want you to meet my grandfather.
Okay.
Well, actually, me and my brother own a bar in Montauk.
Best barflies in the Hamptons, hands down.
Hello, dad.
There's my girl.
Don't you look well?
You're lying your ass off, but I'll take it.
I see that you've met Declan.
He's going to be attending Collins prep
with charlotte this fall.
Well, that's assuming I pass the entrance exams.
And I been working like a dog, but they're, uh--
They're a bitch.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Listen, I never made it past the 11th grade.
But I started Grayson Global from the ground up at 22.
Don't ever let the place you start
dictate where you finish.
Right, Victoria?
Never.
Emily.
Emily, this is my grandfather, Edward Grayson.
It's such a pleasure to meet you, sir.
Daniel's told me so much about you.
I wish I could say the same about you.
Well, in our defense, this courtship
practically materialized out of thin air.
So how did you two love birds meet?
Hey, studybug. Settle an argument for us.
Do you know who this man is?
Nope.
He is poised to be one of the richest men in America.
But he wants to throw all that away
and become a penniless poet.
Now I think he's crazy. What do you think?
I think you should ask someone else.
Oh, no, no, no. We want to ask you.
I mean, I can't be who I am and a poet at the same time.
My parents would never allow it.
You want people to see something different
when they hear your last name?
Make 'em see it.
Be better than your parents.
There ain't nothin' more poetic than that.
Daniel strikes me as a man who knows what he wants.
Be willing to make a decision.
That's what Patton said
was the sign of a true leader.
Evening, all.
Sorry I'm late. I got held up at work.
Still kissing up to the boss after all these years, hey?
Yeah, well, it seems a C.E.O.'s work is never done.
If you'll excuse me.
Charlotte, would you join me in the study, please?
How about a dance?
I'd love that.
You okay with this, Charlotte?
Just give me a second, Declan.
I love you.
Level with me, Vicky.
You think this marriage can be saved?
Come on, dad.
You can hardly be surprised.
Besides, you and I have always spoken the same language.
I've loved a lot of women in my life,
but I never could figure out
how to make it last.
Well, maybe that's because you loved too many at the same time.
Fair enough.
But I'm 80 now...
with nothing to show for it.
I don't want the same fate for you and Conrad.
Oh, neither do I.
Promise me that this is not gonna get ugly.
Here's Amanda's tape.
Thanks, man.
I couldn't have gone to anyone else about this.
Lucky for you, you got
the captain of the geek squad in your back pocket.
That's not what I'm saying, Nolan.
You've been a really good friend.
Probably one of my only.
Can I ask you something,
friend to friend?
Shoot.
Why do you want to watch this?
I mean, if Amanda already admitted
that she set the fire, what does it matter?
Because the reality can't be any worse than my imagination.
What if it is?
Either way, I gotta know.
If I'm gonna let her go,
I have to.
Please. I need to talk to my daddy.
Find the lady with the dark hair.
She was there the night they took him away.
He loved her.
And she loved him.
They kissed on the lips all the time.
Just find her.
I know she'll help us.
Do you know the name of this woman?
Victoria.
Please.
I have to see him again.
采访阿曼达·克拉克 1995年11月17日
Poor kid.
Jack, I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
Yeah, me, too.
Charlotte...
I owe you an apology.
Whatever's happening with this family is not your fault.
I shouldn't have taken my frustrations with your mother
out on you.
So I haven't done anything wrong?
Absolutely not.
No.
If I seem tough, Charlotte,
it's because I want you strong enough
to handle whatever instabilities
may come your way.
Daddy, do you remember when Justin Fowler
broke up with me at my sweet 16 party?
Yeah. Sure.
He was your first love.
And you sat with me for two hours
when my friends were downstairs, wondering where I'd gone.
Remember what you said?
Let 'em wait.
And you sat with me, making me laugh.
You know, that laugh of yours
is probably my most favorite sound
in the whole wide world.
I'm not afraid of instability, daddy.
As long as I have you,
there's nothing I can't handle.
Come here.
There's my girl.
Emily.
Dinner's almost ready.
Why don't you come join the others on the patio?
This is just a dvd from another wedding planner.
I wouldn't want Ashley to get the wrong idea.
Well, that's so thoughtful.
Amanda!
Amanda, open the door.
I know you're in there. Please...
Just talk to me.
Look, I don't know why you pushed me away,
And I don't care. I just want to help you.
I saw the tape.
I know what Victoria did to you.
I know she left you in that awful place.
I probably would've burned that house down myself.
Please open the door.
Amanda! Are you in there?!
Please just talk to me.
Excuse me. This is one of the foundations I work for.
Amanda.
If you were gonna let Jack watch the tape,
why'd you make me push him away?
I didn't let him watch it.
Somebody did.
How do you know that?
Because he was just here.
He nearly broke the door down.
Amanda, listen to me--
No, I'm done listening to you.
I'm gonna start listening to Jack now.
I'm going after him.
Amanda--
Modern technology...
it's gonna be the death of us all.
Come on. Join the party.
Jack!
Jack! Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
And the rain was pouring down on us,
but I just kept going.
and, uh, and somehow,
she found it in her heart to say yes.
That's great.
And Daniel tells me you're independently wealthy.
Here's to small miracles.
She studies cultures all around the world,
speaks several different languages,
devotes her time to charity.
Well...
She's pretty special.
Beauty, brains, and a big heart to boot.
You know who you remind me of?
Victoria.
Don't you all see the resemblance?
Sir. Excuse me. Sir.
You couldn't do it.
You couldn't just leave her the hell alone.
Jack, I-I--
Excuse me, Porter, we're kind of in the middle
of a family dinner here, so--
Back off, Grayson.
I'm not here for you.
Well, if you're here for Emily,
I'm sure she made it clear, she's not interested.
Don't push me.
Enough!
Stop it.
Mr. Porter, you have some nerve coming here.
I've got some nerve?
What did you say to Amanda Clarke
to make her leave town?
Don't be ridiculous.
Obviously, you've been misinformed.
As misinformed as David Clarke was
when Amanda saw you kissing him?
Mom, what is he talking about?
I know. I know you were in love with Amanda's father.
But I guess it was more important to hide that from the world
than to help the little girl that he left behind.
You have an active imagination.
Who needs imagination?
I've seen the videotape.
It's no wonder her life turned out as rough as it did.
But you could've prevented that, and you did nothing.
Nothing.
If you don't stop telling lies about Amanda Clarke,
I'm gonna start telling the truth about you.
Jack. Hey, wait up.
Victoria, is this true?
Listen, he doesn't know
what really happened with David Clarke.
Murder and terrorism weren't his only crimes.
What happened wasn mom's fault.
Is that the story you're spinning these days?
Astonishing, the lengths you'll go to
for self-preservation.
Not another word, Conrad.
I am warning you.
She's right. Charlotte doesn't deserve to be in the middle of this.
No, she doesn't deserve to be in the middle of it,
but she's right in the center of it.
And she has your mother to thank for that.
Somebody better tell me what's going on right now
or I swear--
Charlotte, sweetheart,
you said that you could handle anything
as long as you have me.
Well, you have me, always.
And it's time you know the truth.
David Clarke isn't just Amanda's father.
He's your biological father as well.
No.
He's not.
Mom...
Charlotte!
I will never forgive you for this.
And I'll never forgive you for inviting that bastard
into our bed.
She didn't invite him, dad.
That's not what happened.
No, no, that's exactly what happened, Daniel.
Whatever you think you know,
that man never attacked your mother.
No.
And it wasn't just one night.
It was an ongoing affair.
No, you're wrong. Mom, tell him.
Mom, tell him.
So much for the possibility of a friendly divorce.
Well, she'll settle quietly. I'm making sure of that.
Do I have to remind you what happened to this company
the last time David Clarke's name
was associated with it?
Why are you talking to me like I'm the one
who slept with him?
She did this to our family, willingly.
I am less concerned about her sins as a wife
than I am about your sins as a father.
What kind of a man forces his children to participate
in a charade like this?
You did when you taught me that perception is reality!
In business, Conrad!
This is family.
It's the same difference, isn't it?
If that is all I passed on to you,
then you should understand why I am suggesting
that you step down as C.E.O. of Grayson Global,
and we begin to groom your son to take your place.
Clearly, Daniel is the only one left
willing and able to stand up for what's left of this family.
You can't be serious. He's just a kid.
He's older than I was when I started this company!
All due respect,
you might have brought the Grayson name to the company,
but I brought the Global.
All due respect, son,
I am still chairman of the board.
Hello.
Jack, it's Emily.
I just wanted to make sure that you were okay.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm sorry about the party.
I was just... so angry.
Have you talked to Amanda?
No. I can't find her.
I've been back by her hotel a couple of times,
but... other than that, I don't know where to look.
Well, maybe she doesn't want to be found.
I know you really care about her,
but you can't fix a person if they don't want to be helped.
But if you'd just seen this tape, Emily...
She was just some little girl that everyone stopped fighting for.
I-I have to go, Jack. I'm sorry.
How's Charlotte?
She's not answering her phone.
She should never have found out this way.
She's stronger than you think.
I think I'll go look for her.
I feel like such a fool for defending my mother.
If she lied about this,
I'll never believe another word she says.
I'll come by later, all right?
Maybe she had her reasons, you know?
So now you're on her side?
No, Charlotte, I'm on your side.
But maybe it's not what it seems.
Maybe there's something more to understand.
No, there isn't.
This is my mother we're talking about.
Charlotte, that's not a good idea right now.
Come on.
Look, you're either with me...
or against me.
I'm with you, Charlotte.
But this isn't you.
Just because he's not really your dad
doesn't mean he's gonna stop being your father.
That's exactly what it means.
Well, at least you still have one.
My father...
is dead, Declan,
Just like yours.
Truth is a battle of perceptions.
People only see what they're prepared to confront.
Charlotte.
It's not what you look at that matters,
but what you see.
Jack saw the tape, Nolan.
What the hell happened?
I'm sorry. The degausser didn't work.
It's a relic. What can I say?
Thanks to you, Jack showed up at the Graysons
and threatened Victoria.
Now he's in her crosshairs, too.
Thanks to me?
Jack was bound and determined, Emily.
And do I need to remind you how that tape
got into his hands in the first place?
Besides, wasn't it always part of your plan
to reveal Charlotte's paternity at that dinner anyway?
My way, Nolan.
Now Amanda's on the run,
and Jack's more involved than ever.
Calm down. Count to ten. Take a breath.
We've been in worse situations before.
You'll get out of this one, too.
Are you there?
Emily?
And when different perceptions battle against one another...
The truth has a way of getting lost...

Emily?
Are you there?
What's going on?
Emily?
And the monsters...
