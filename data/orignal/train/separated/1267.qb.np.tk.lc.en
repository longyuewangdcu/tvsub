got something for me ?
right here .
everything cool ?
yeah .
hey , there .
you got a second ?
tell me !
it &apos;s just detail it ?
the only time i wash my car is right before i sell it .
it only has to be detailed again
because you spilled your triple power latte ,
and it smells like a deco .
what &apos;s deco ?
a decomposing body .
how do you know it was me ?
you know , europeans have it right .
car engineers design them without cup holders .
where do you put your coffee ?
you drink it at a cafe .
you do not slosh it around in your car .
i don &apos;t slosh , and where are you going ?
to a rave with your friends atticus and tallulah ?
no , feels more like cafe ace with london rockers .
can you two go inspect someone else ?
that &apos;s very yellow .
thank you .
you know , you should be very careful
around ovulating women .
the university of texas study
determined that ovulating women are attracted to biker types
in order to fertilize their eggs .
ha ! explains what happened
with , uh , me and your father .
whoa , pop rode a motorcycle ?
i &apos;d rather not remember .
i thought if i looked the part ,
i might get a u.c. assignment faster .
did you hear we have a new boss at dcu ?
you ever meet him , jane ? lieutenant --
rafael martinez .
it &apos;s been a long time , rizzoli .
rafi , when did you crawl out from under the covers ?
vinnie !
i don &apos;t think we ever met , sir .
so , you &apos;re the other rizzoli .
yeah , yeah , i guess so , sir .
okay , other rizzoli .
my office in 10 .
sure .
did you two -- - maura , not now .
frankie .
oh , i cannot get a break .
frankie , come on !
what did you two do ?
i have to get this .
don &apos;t you ?
rizzoli .
dr. isles .
jane !
yeah , we &apos;ll be right there .
jane !
bye , ma .
well , thanks to you , i don &apos;t have
a change of clothes in my car --
it &apos;s getting -- detailed .
how many times do you want me to apologize ?
here . you can borrow these .
fine .
ruin your $ 200 zambonis .
zanottis .
these are giuseppe zanottis . they &apos;re $ 550 .
550 bucks !
i hope they gave you the rest of the cow .
you know , for that , they should give you the whole herd .
mother ... phooey .
morning , sergeant .
morning .
so , martinez is back , huh ?
it &apos;ll be fine .
oh , no , it &apos;s wicking .
oh , no .
what &apos;s wicking ?
it &apos;s being absorbed into the leather .
well , that wouldn &apos;t have happened
if you were wearing these .
we got a good , old jurisdictional turf war
with the staties .
tide is going out .
body &apos;ll be on the sand in 15 minutes .
we &apos;ll have to work this case with the state police .
that is bullshit .
why do they get jurisdiction over the beaches ?
all right , we got to get her
to float back into bpd territory .
we can &apos;t move the body now , jane .
hey , rizzoli !
since we got this ,
you mind grabbing us some coffee ?
oh , yeah , sure , right after i solve this homicide , okay ?
i can &apos;t stand bob thatcher .
yeah , officious and competitive .
want to help me twist off his balding head ?
can we make it look like a suicide ?
i never liked him , either .
the body is almost on the beach .
i guess i &apos;m gonna be working this with the state police .
oh , my gosh , look , maura !
there &apos;s a -- there &apos;s a horseshoe crab !
right there !
where ?
right there !
yeah , yeah , i see one right there .
there haven &apos;t been any horseshoe crabs
in dorchester bay in 25 years .
they &apos;re back .
oh , look , there &apos;s another one right there !
now , be careful . they &apos;re endangered .
what ? where ?
i haven &apos;t seen one since i was a little kid .
dr. isles , i -- i think i see an egg .
okay !
you are in a delicate mating area
of the limulus polyphemus !
okay , i need crime @-@ scene tape and barricades now !
hurry !
oh , look at that ! she &apos;s in the surf !
guess this one &apos;s ours !
oh , that &apos;s cute , rizzoli !
that &apos;s real cute !
listen , since you &apos;re not doing anything ,
can you grab me a triple power latte ? !
thank you !
korsak .
she &apos;s so young .
we didn &apos;t find any i.d. on her .
we also didn &apos;t find any horseshoe crabs .
i &apos;m sorry . it was all i could think of .
it &apos;s pretty symmetrical gashes .
i mean , these aren &apos;t from banging into pilings .
look at this .
it takes a lot of force
to pull hair from the scalp right there .
somebody slammed her head into something .
you think that &apos;s what killed her ?
well , froth in the nose and mouth
indicates drowning ,
but i &apos;ll need to do a full autopsy .
you &apos;re gonna have a hell of a time
pulling prints off of her .
early stage maceration .
a saline injection should restore fingerpads .
how long was she in the water ?
floaters are a unique challenge .
the ocean is a very effective medium
for destroying forensics .
how did i know you &apos;d say that ?
i &apos;ll give you a window .
she was in the water for 8 to 10 hours .
given the tidal flow and the current ,
she was dumped from somewhere inside the harbor .
saw that from the crow &apos;s nest , did you , sailor ?
i &apos;m not even gonna dignify that
with an answer , gym rat .
i know that because she &apos;s not halfway to bermuda .
inside the harbor ? that &apos;s still a big area to cover .
we got to find the crime scene
where this poor girl was killed .
you &apos;re still wearing my boots .
you know i want &apos; em back .
now ?
they &apos;re so comfortable .
okay , fine . you can keep &apos; em .
really ?
yes .
as long as you promise to wear them
with all your yellow outfits .
i will change out of them as soon as i get a minute .
maura ,
what is this abrasion ?
it &apos;s sticky .
what is martinez doing down here ?
uh , well , dcu &apos;s evidence
is getting processed in @-@ house now .
what happened with him ?
can we talk about this when he &apos;s not ten feet away ?
dr. isles .
i should have introduced myself .
rafael martinez .
it &apos;s a little overwhelming coming back here
after being gone for so long .
gone ?
so , you &apos;re returning to bpd ?
and here i thought detective rizzoli
had told you all about me .
it didn &apos;t even occur to me .
it &apos;s very nice of you to introduce yourself .
if you need anything ,
feel free to contact me or my staff .
thank you .
i finally get promoted to detective ,
and my boss hates rizzolis .
hey , thanks , jane .
well , maybe it &apos;s not rizzolis he hates
maybe it &apos;s police work .
no , it &apos;s rizzolis .
you slept with rafael .
we didn &apos;t sleep , maura .
oh , it &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of .
rafael is very attractive .
you &apos;re very attractive .
rafael wasn &apos;t your boss , was he ?
can you please stop calling him rafael ?
and , no , he wasn &apos;t .
rafael is his name .
in a harlequin romance .
at work , here , it &apos;s martinez .
okay , so , other than in the biblical sense ,
how do you know lieutenant martinez ?
we worked together when i started in the drug unit .
we had to play a couple and go to clubs
and dance and blend in and drink and bust people .
i was hoping i &apos;d never see him again .
oh , no .
jane , was he married ?
no .
actually , that would have been easier .
we got my c.i. killed .
i &apos;m so sorry .
yeah , and then we had a falling out ,
and then he took an assignment
with a federal task force ,
and that was eight years ago ,
and i haven &apos;t seen him since .
dr. isles ?
your sister &apos;s upstairs .
my sister ?
that &apos;s what she said .
you do have a sister , maura .
oh , right .
yes , tell cailin to wait for me in the café .
you know , you &apos;re a little harlequin romance @-@ y yourself .
what do you mean ?
well , in the space of two years ,
you found out your biological dad is a gangster
who &apos;s about to star in his own r.i.c.o. trial ,
and mom , a renowned humanitarian ,
who is nice to everyone but you .
what else ? let &apos;s see . am i forgetting something ?
i gave my kidney to a half @-@ sister i don &apos;t know .
i think i &apos;m more of a dickensian character .
yeah , or a really good guest on &quot; jerry springer . &quot;
come on .
where am i going ?
to offer moral support
in case cailin wants another one of my organs .
no , thanks .
unless ...
unless what ?
love your wellies .
you drive a hard bargain .
cailin .
what a surprise .
you shouldn &apos;t bite your nails .
it &apos;s very unsanitary and bad for your teeth .
you &apos;ll have to excuse her .
believe it or not , you make your big sister nervous .
me ? why ?
well , she wants you to like her .
25 % of all young adults bite their nails .
you &apos;ll grow out of it .
see ? it &apos;s nerves .
sorry . sorry .
no , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry to just show up here .
would you like to talk to maura alone ?
no . i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
it &apos;s about my mom .
our mom .
you want to sit down ?
yeah .
is she all right ?
i &apos;m not sure .
some men came by the house last night .
what kind of men ?
scary ones .
i mean , they wore suits ,
but they had this , like , dark energy .
well , do you know what they wanted ?
no , but they seemed pissed .
she told me to go to my room and lock my door .
lock your door ?
they were talking pretty quietly ,
but i heard them ask her about m.e.n.d.
medical emergency network of doctors .
that &apos;s hope &apos;s charity .
well , could it have been about fundraising ?
it sounded like they were threatening her .
she says we &apos;re going back to london .
well , isn &apos;t that a good idea ? i thought you missed london .
i love it here now .
but ... i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s too full of ghosts for her .
i -- i don &apos;t mean you .
you mean paddy doyle ?
yeah , i see her reading the papers .
she &apos;s following his r.i.c.o. pre @-@ trial hearings .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re wearing it .
it &apos;s very sweet of you to give it to me .
i got to get back to class .
i &apos;d really appreciate it if you &apos;d talk to her ,
find out what &apos;s going on .
okay .
now what ?
no idea .
i can &apos;t think in these boots .
come on , let me do it .
no .
let me at least run the search .
no way !
nothing in afic or ncic .
who the hell is she ?
you got to go to the seminar
and read the manual .
it &apos;s not your personal toy .
and it &apos;s not an arcade game .
move . i want to run the training session .
stop !
stop messing around . i &apos;m not gonna break it .
stop it ! you &apos;re gonna break it .
could you kids please share your toys ?
well , he hogs the thing like he owns it .
yeah , because one swipe from bear paws here
will take out the whole system .
so , no i.d. ? she &apos;s still a jane doe ?
we got to wait on dental records .
preliminary results are back
on the tissue samples from her lungs .
lungs ?
wasn &apos;t cause of death drowning ?
yes , but not from seawater .
sparkling water ?
no , she aspirated rainwater .
we &apos;re looking for a crime scene
with a bucket full of rainwater ?
well , we know the body
was tossed in the ocean somewhere near the harbor .
yeah , maybe she was killed near the harbor , too .
are there any tests you can run ?
i &apos;ll have susie run the water from the lungs through the mass spectrometer .
it is a long shot , though .
hey , what are you doing for lunch ?
nothing . why ?
come on , maura . you can do this . come on .
no , i don &apos;t like to be tricked twice in one day .
i said we were having lunch . i didn &apos;t say where .
oh , it was wise of you not to tell me what lunch was , either .
what , you don &apos;t like cold , greasy corn dogs ?
you know , this used to be a methadone clinic ,
but thanks to dr . hope martin ,
it &apos;s the first m.e.n.d. clinic in the u.s.
look , i do not object to her saving women and children ,
but i do object to her calling me a liar
and then ignoring me until she needed my kidney .
you &apos;re a good person .
why do we always feel this tug
when we &apos;re related by blood ?
what does the research say ?
nothing that explains how i feel .
name ?
detective rizzoli !
hi , shandra .
girl , you are still as skinny
as the day you locked me up .
how are you ? you look great .
thank you . this woman is the reason i quit drugs
and finished nursing school .
look at you .
thank you .
sorry it &apos;s so crazy in here today .
no , that &apos;s all right .
we &apos;re actually here to see dr . martin .
bye @-@ bye .
maura .
detective rizzoli .
is cailin all right ?
yeah , she &apos;s fine .
she &apos;s a little concerned about you , though .
about me ? why ?
where did you get that necklace ?
oh , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i thought you knew that cailin gave it to me .
oh , of course .
shandra , could you please
put mrs. reynolds in room two
and weigh that perez baby ? thanks .
let &apos;s go talk in my office .
teenagers can be so dramatic .
those &quot; big , scary men -- &quot; they &apos;re my accountants .
well , i &apos;ll talk to her .
your accountants come at 11 : 00 at night ?
well , i am too busy during the day .
she &apos;s afraid for you , hope .
and that &apos;s silly .
and although i &apos;m very sorry that she put you through this ,
i really am glad to see you , maura .
i don &apos;t want to pry into your life .
i just feel a responsibility to cailin .
i told her i would talk to you .
and i so appreciate it , but , really ,
it &apos;s just m.e.n.d. business .
is that why you told cailin to lock the door ?
and why are you moving back to london ?
is someone threatening you , hope ?
sorry , doctor .
we &apos;re getting a little behind .
i will be right there .
i &apos;m sorry , but i have to get back to work .
how can you go back to london
with all these people depending on you ?
every clinic that i open
has to run without me eventually .
and i do have to think about cailin .
she wants to move back to london .
thank you .
too bad lying give her hives .
maybe she has a reason , jane .
what -- the truth gives her eczema ?
you don &apos;t like her , do you ?
no , i don &apos;t like the way she treats you .
cailin &apos;s an adult . have a relationship with her .
you know , you don &apos;t have to have contact with hope .
and , by the way ,
what does constance say about all this ?
she raised me . she &apos;s my mother .
i don &apos;t talk about it with her .
hey , frost . what &apos;s up ?
got something , although bear paws
might take the rest of his life pulling it up .
you know , some research indicates
that a wide hand with stubby fingers
correlates with high intelligence .
see that , smart ass ?
got our victim .
brenda thomas , 20 .
she was a bcu student .
and a psi beta tau .
same type as in my day .
betas were smart , foxy .
you didn &apos;t go to college , korsak .
i went to a lot of toga parties .
i wouldn &apos;t use that .
expired lipstick grows bacteria .
is it pinkish red in a black tube ?
yes .
she &apos;s had that since i got promoted .
ignore him , jane .
victim &apos;s parents live in dedham .
we &apos;ll make the notification , then hit the sorority house .
all right , i &apos;ll meet you back at bpd .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i forgot to get my dry cleaning ,
so i &apos;m gonna drop you off and pick it up .
okay .
you said this was about my daughter , so get to it .
call your boys off maura .
what the hell you talking about ?
the thugs you got following maura .
call them off , paddy .
is she okay ? is maura all right ?
yeah , she &apos;s fine .
why are your guys following her ?
are these the same guys that you sicced on hope ?
did you get a look at &apos; em ?
they &apos;re not your guys , are they ?
i don &apos;t think you need me
to answer that one for you , rizzoli .
why are the feds after hope ?
why are they surveilling maura ?
i &apos;m done here .
no , wait a minute !
why are they surveilling maura ?
thanks , gabriel . i really appreciate it .
that was awkward .
thank you for calling agent dean .
i know that was hard .
what did he say ?
he said he really shouldn &apos;t be talking to me ,
but here &apos;s what he knows .
the organized crime division of the fbi
is investigating m.e.n.d. and hope .
oh , my god . for what ?
he said he didn &apos;t know .
but think about it , maura .
it &apos;s got to be connected to paddy .
and you should have seen paddy &apos;s face .
he knows why .
okay . she started m.e.n.d. in 1993 .
that &apos;s 20 years ago .
which means they were in contact after i was born .
maybe even when he was a fugitive .
they &apos;re following you , too .
the feds ?
yeah , i saw them today .
why ?
i don &apos;t have anything to do with m.e.n.d. or with paddy .
what do i do ?
nothing .
i mean , there &apos;s nothing you can do once they &apos;re surveilling you .
all right , i got to go talk to the victim &apos;s roommates .
go .
go , it &apos;s okay .
you seeing anything ?
just a bunch of girly stuff .
i think i just found some study aids .
&quot; bcu gold dust . &quot;
looks like cocaine .
jane &apos;s stuck on memorial drive .
we have to get dcu involved .
what &apos;s the deal between jane and martinez ?
it is a long story .
rachel ?
come in here , please , would you ?
did brenda snort a lot of cocaine ?
no way .
she was so against drugs .
she didn &apos;t even drink .
she told me that her brother died from an o.d.
help your friend out , rachel .
we need to know what brenda was into .
school .
how about the rest of you ? you recognize this ?
i don &apos;t know why she had that , but she was not using it .
did she have a boyfriend ?
no .
she studied so much , she &apos;d fall asleep in the library .
that &apos;s why we weren &apos;t worried when she didn &apos;t come home .
what was she studying ?
brenda wanted to be an investigative journalist .
like woodward and bernstein ?
no , like christiane amanpour .
she got an &quot; a &quot; on this investigative report .
yeah , she got an &quot; a &quot; on everything .
who is t.f. ?
her adviser , tyrell feeney .
brenda called him &quot; touchy feeney . &quot;
maybe touchy feeney did more than just touch .
looks like brenda didn &apos;t want her sorority sisters in her computer .
she password @-@ protected everything and stored it in the cloud .
there &apos;s no way i &apos;ll get in without a password .
did you try &quot; password &quot; ?
&quot; password &quot; ?
yeah . it &apos;s the most common password .
what do we know about mr. touchy feeney ?
well , he was a part @-@ time adjunct professor at bcu ,
wrote about crime for the boston dispatch .
okay , this is interesting .
he owns a boat .
does he ?
i wonder if he took brenda for a ride .
nice boat .
we found it when we were doing a little digging
into a dead girl &apos;s relationships .
brenda and i didn &apos;t have a relationship .
she was an exceptional student . that &apos;s all .
how so ?
she was truly gifted .
she could write , and she could get anybody to talk to her .
when she thought she had a story , you couldn &apos;t shake her loose .
what was she working on ?
i had all my students working on investigative pieces
for the boston dispatch college contest .
what was she investigating ?
i don &apos;t know .
you were her adviser .
i made an exception .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t have ,
but , like any good journalist ,
brenda was protecting her sources .
well , maybe she just didn &apos;t want any contact with you , tyrell .
you are a hugger .
that was me just being friendly and encouraging .
you hug all your students ?
she was 21 .
even if i did hug her , which i didn &apos;t ,
it isn &apos;t a crime .
not unless you killed her .
i did not kill her .
where were you last night ?
out with my wife .
she can verify that .
next time you guys would like to talk to me , call my lawyer .
frankie .
oh , come on , frankie .
what ?
you look terrible .
thanks .
what can i do ?
fix it .
whatever happened between you and martinez , undo it .
well , you know what , frankie ?
it &apos;s not that easy , all right ?
i &apos;ll just suck it up while martinez shuts me out of any real drug work .
dcu &apos;s working my homicide , okay ?
i &apos;ll get you on it .
oh , fun !
maybe you &apos;ll let me answer your phones .
you know what , frankie ?
other rizzoli .
been looking for you . come on .
wait , frankie , come ...
you and martinez should &apos;ve worked this out eight years ago .
vince , come on . this is my business , all right ?
but we &apos;re all caught up in the middle of it , jane .
clean it up .
oh , good , jane .
i &apos;ve got something .
i may be able to narrow down the location of the crime scene .
that &apos;s great news . how ?
well , the water in brenda &apos;s lungs showed low levels of salinity
plus co2 as bicarbonate anion , fish scales , and rust .
what kind of rust ?
heavy @-@ gauge tin .
saline , fish scales , and rusty tin .
that all says one of the old warehouses near the harbor to me .
yeah , me , too .
what &apos;s bicarbonated anion ?
rainwater .
hey , frost , can you check the seaport district ?
see how many abandoned warehouses are down there ?
you don &apos;t know how to use that .
oh , yeah ? i read the whole manual .
there are only seven processing plants still standing .
let &apos;s go check &apos; em out .
this is number 4 .
well , look at that .
looks like we found our bucket of rainwater .
water from the roof is leaking right into it .
i &apos;ll compare the water in here to the water from her lungs .
that &apos;s blood , and that &apos;s hair .
get csru here , have &apos; em process everything .
the water is a match .
okay , this is our crime scene .
found a wireless mike .
it &apos;s greasy .
looks like someone crushed it with his heel .
maybe she was wearing a microphone .
that explains the adhesive we found .
she had a mike taped to her chest .
these mikes are pretty cheap ,
but they give a near @-@ broadcast @-@ quality recording .
near @-@ broadcast quality .
she wanted to be like christiane amanpour .
maybe she was wired for an ambush interview .
well , that &apos;ll get you killed .
yeah , especially when you &apos;re writing about drugs .
think about it . she didn &apos;t do drugs .
she was writing an investigative piece .
what about those bindles we found ?
she had &apos; em arranged like evidence .
maybe she was cataloging them for the story ?
i &apos;ve tried getting into her cloud .
we need her password .
i &apos;m telling you , try &quot; password . &quot;
try &quot; bcu gold . &quot;
we &apos;re in !
crap . almost .
the audio files are individually password protected .
try &quot; password . &quot;
if you say that again ,
i don &apos;t care how big your bear paws are ...
trying &quot; bcu gold . &quot;
no .
yes !
this one &apos;s opening .
please !
please !
don &apos;t !
hey , korsak , you ever wish you went to college ?
yeah , sometimes .
you ?
i saved my acceptance letter
to boston cambridge university .
i don &apos;t know why .
i do .
it &apos;s damned impressive that you got in ,
and unbelievably selfless that you chose not to go .
i &apos;m the daughter of a plumber .
my parents would still be paying it off .
what is it ?
there &apos;s something in here .
拉斐尔 · 马丁内斯警督
looks like you got another c.i. killed .
what the hell are you talking about ?
brenda thomas . you recognize her ?
&apos;cause we pulled her body out of the harbor .
you knew .
cavanaugh told me after they found
the cocaine in brenda &apos;s room .
we got brought in to investigate , yes .
well , you seem pretty calm
for someone who just lost a c.i.
she wasn &apos;t my c.i.
no ?
then why does she have your card and your safety word ?
because all your informants are expendable , right ?
just one more dead one .
one more dead one like yolanda .
brenda asked for an interview
for a story about campus drugs .
i talked to her because she told me
she could get me into a big operation .
we &apos;ve been trying to bust the guy
supplying to all the colleges in boston .
with bcu gold ?
with a lot of cocaine , yes .
so , you send this little college kid
to do an undercover drug buy ?
one time , rizzoli !
do you know another way to bust drug dealers ?
you use c.i.s.
nobody likes it , but that &apos;s how it is .
well , why didn &apos;t you tell me about all this ?
i thought we were working together .
are we ?
i want to know everything you know about the supplier .
i got nothing .
well , you better get something
because this naive kid ,
who didn &apos;t want anybody o.d.ing , like her brother ,
was drowned in a fish trough .
and that &apos;s on you , martinez .
we already picked up the guy
from the buy brenda made for us .
we &apos;re trying to get him to make an introduction
to one of my undercovers .
one of your under--
who , frankie ?
do me a favor .
don &apos;t get my brother killed .
what the hell happened to the dirty robber ?
new owners committed to locally sourced organic food .
yeah , well , i &apos;m committed
to finding a burger and fries .
oh , no , come on .
just try it .
come on .
there &apos;s a table right there .
anything ?
frost can &apos;t get into the rest of brenda &apos;s files .
what about you ? you thinking about hope ?
jane , are they here ?
who ?
the feds .
yes . you see that guy right there
with the nose ring and a bolt through his ear ?
that &apos;s their lead agent .
yeah . no , maura .
no ?
no .
what -- now , why are you eating their plants ?
fresh lavender . try it .
smells like hand lotion .
well , they do have burgers .
this sounds good , this scrambled tofu patty .
yummy .
get it with a side of mung bean fries .
i can &apos;t stop thinking about brenda .
me , neither .
we didn &apos;t get her killed , maura . i did .
you &apos;re not talking about brenda , are you ?
i guess that &apos;s why i &apos;ve been so mad at martinez .
are you sure you &apos;re okay ?
um , yeah .
we &apos;re gonna be right here listening the whole time .
you have any problems , just say the word &quot; cricket . &quot;
yeah , we use the word cricket
so you won &apos;t slip up and make a mistake , all right ?
you only use it if you &apos;re in trouble .
okay .
i just so desperately wanted my own c.i. ,
and i leaned on this sweet , screwed @-@ up girl
named yolanda .
you good to go ?
let &apos;s do it .
she wasn &apos;t ready , but i offered her up , anyway .
what are you doing ?
i told you i &apos;d be here .
you have it with you ? i have the money .
who &apos;s with you ?
nobody &apos;s with me . i &apos;m alone .
she &apos;s in trouble .
wait for the safety word .
no , don &apos;t !
you wired ?
cricket ! cricket !
we got to go !
bpd !
oh , no , no . come on .
come on , baby . yolanda , it &apos;s me .
yolanda ?
what is it ?
frost got into
the other three files in brenda &apos;s cloud .
she taped three buys with student drug dealers 。
here &apos;s the last one .
recorded the afternoon she died .
i really need something to get me through finals .
i got you covered .
you &apos;re a sweetheart .
you could sell so much bcu gold to my sisters
if you &apos;d just come to the house .
i already told you , it &apos;s too risky .
i heard someone got arrested there .
so ? introduce me to your connection .
i &apos;ll do it , cut you in for 40 % .
i don &apos;t know .
come on , it &apos;ll be easy .
well , she got that introduction ,
and whoever &apos;s running this thing killed her ,
so how do we find that student ?
i &apos;ll get on it first thing tomorrow .
what ? what is it ?
cailin .
the feds just left hope &apos;s house .
i &apos;ve got to show you something .
just when i thought i &apos;d seen everything .
i figured out how to do it when i was 9 .
my parents didn &apos;t want me watching tv ,
so they locked it up .
it &apos;s over here .
ooh , maura , you &apos;ve been down here before .
god , this is so unlike you .
maybe not . i am the spawn of a mobster , after all .
well , is that why you come down here ?
when paddy got arrested ,
i started poking through all these files .
they go all the way back to his father .
your grandfather .
yes .
maura , come on . you &apos;re not like him .
you &apos;re not like any of &apos; em .
well , something in these files is gonna tell us
why the feds were looking at me and at hope .
1993 -- that &apos;s the year paddy became a fugitive .
there &apos;s not a lot here while he was on the run .
i bet the fbi has a ton .
look .
she came back once a year on my birthday .
well , that &apos;s touching .
maura , she thought you were dead .
okay , what if she wasn &apos;t coming for me ?
what do you mean ?
i have a hunch .
oh , no , here we go .
maura , i told you never to hunch .
you &apos;re not made for hunching .
okay .
cailin told me that paddy
gave this to hope on her 18th birthday .
that would have been 1976 .
that &apos;s not possible
because this scrimshaw
commemorates something that was built in 1993 .
the year paddy disappeared ?
yes .
and the year that hope was working as a relief doctor
in a war @-@ torn area , sarajevo .
so , i did some research , and i looked up
photos on the internet of this bridge .
and it was near a secret tunnel that was built
during the siege of sarajevo
by people trying to get humanitarian aid into the city .
humanitarian aid ?
you think your mother helped build it ?
they named it the tunnel of hope .
oh , my god .
paddy was a fugitive in 1993 .
he could have easily traveled to the balkans .
so , you think paddy and hope met in sarajevo ?
it &apos;s worse .
hope started m.e.n.d.
thanks to a $ 2.5 million donation
from an anonymous donor ...
in 1993 , jane .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s why the feds are sniffing around .
she took his dirty money .
why am i here ?
take a look at that .
they &apos;re the financial statements from m.e.n.d.
and why are you looking at them ?
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re the only ones looking .
i don &apos;t know what you mean .
who gave you the money to start m.e.n.d. ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but i will be forever grateful to him or her .
because , thanks to that money ,
we &apos;ve been able to save thousands of women and children .
i need to know .
was it paddy ?
i have sick patients that i need to see .
you won &apos;t be able to help them
if you &apos;re named as a co @-@ conspirator .
is that why the feds are putting pressure on you ?
were you laundering money for him ?
i can &apos;t -- - can &apos;t what ?
i can &apos;t involve you .
i am involved .
they &apos;re following me , too .
what ?
oh , god , maura . no .
i need to see him , and i need to talk to him .
i need to make this stop .
maura .
don &apos;t talk to me .
talk to her .
you told me she was dead .
you told me that our baby ...
was dead .
i had to -- to protect you .
why ?
my father would have killed you both .
you have another chance to protect them , paddy .
how &apos;s that ?
you &apos;re going to plead guilty .
you know i &apos;d kill for either of you .
but i will never plead guilty .
mother ... phooey .
did anything csru processed from the crime scene
yield any prints or dna ?
i &apos;m sorry , nothing .
oh , wait . there was one thing , though .
the residue on the wireless mike
is transmission fluid with 41 @-@ 40 steel particulates .
that &apos;s a transmission grinding itself up .
jane , i think these are metal particulates ,
and i am almost certain that what i stepped in
was transmission fluid .
from the parking lot of the first crime scene ?
yes .
susie , run both sets of metal particulate through the sem @-@ edx
and analyze the fluids from the shoe and the microphone
using the hplc .
so , you &apos;re saying the transmission fluid
on the microphone we found in the processing plant
is the same as the stuff you stepped in
when we found her body ?
yes .
csru usually takes photos
to establish the location of the crime scene .
yeah , frost , are there any photos from the parking lot ?
mm @-@ hmm . right here .
so , it &apos;s one of these cars ?
wait a minute -- we can &apos;t know our killer left that fluid
on the day we fished her body out of the drink .
yeah , we can .
i can even tell you which car was leaking .
oh , that multi @-@ touch interface
is talking to you , tom cruise ?
it &apos;s right here
in the vehicle maintenance records .
for the state police .
our killer &apos;s a state trooper .
martinez .
hey , vinnie , what &apos;s up ?
we &apos;re on our way to arrest brenda &apos;s killer .
yeah , you can come with us , if you want .
yeah . i &apos;d like that .
where to ?
we tracked the suspect on the gps in his unmarked .
it &apos;s a cop ?
yeah , it &apos;s a state trooper .
looks like it was the college supplier
brenda was telling you about .
where is he ?
bcu campus -- probably there
to collect his last payments before he splits .
you got plates ?
yeah .
no , no , i don &apos;t want campus police pulling him over .
i &apos;m not calling campus police .
i &apos;m calling someone to make sure he doesn &apos;t get away .
can you move that ?
oh , i can &apos;t seem to get it to turn over .
all right , i &apos;ll help you push it out of the way .
i &apos;m in a hurry .
frankie , get out of the way !
thatcher , it &apos;s all over !
no , you don &apos;t ! no , you don &apos;t !
you stay together or i will blow his head off !
don &apos;t do it .
anything happens to my brother ,
i won &apos;t need this gun to kill you .
this is as much on you as it is on me .
looks like you got nowhere to go , dude .
all right , you drop the bike , and you get in my car .
lift it up ! get it up !
you &apos;re under arrest , thatcher .
my brother &apos;s good , huh ?
yeah .
all right , just relax .
almost as good as you .
don &apos;t even .
what ?
