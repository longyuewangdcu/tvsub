六部曲之第一部
S-So lonely.
No sex without a ring.
Damn it!
矮人与爱尔兰人不得入内
What the...?!
What about us, man?
Get your own couch.
Poor Chip. Such a big part of everyone's life.
People called him the "Sixth Simpson."
I'm not sure why.
Chip did such a wonderful job with my biography.
奇普·戴维斯著
Chip was the life of Sector 6-F at the nuclear plant,
but Chip once confessed to me he did have a few regrets.
Chip regretted never ascending
Mount Springfield from the south face.
He regretted that the high school long jump record he set
was wind-aided.
He often spoke of that asterisk.
He never broke par on hole 17
at Springfield Mini Golf.
Let us pray.
Eh, everyone has regrets.
Not me.
You? Your marriage is a dead fish
floating in a tank of stale beer.
Your baby's addicted to pacifiers.
And your son is out of control.
Let us kneel.
Ow! My knees!
40 years of healing, gone!
He's such a little dickens.
Although Dickens was pretty well behaved.
He's been screwed up since the moment Homer's DNA
staggered into your womb.
I have no regrets about that.
It was a perfect pregnancy.
Didn't smoke, didn't drink, lost three pounds.
And every night before bed,
Homer would give me a little kiss...
Music!
Could Bart have been prenatally screwed up
by the KISS music?
*Get up! Everybody's gonna move their feet.*
*Get down! Everybody's gonna leave their seats.*
*You got to lose your mind in Detroit Rock City.*
Man, this is the weirdest pregnancy craving ever.
Well, for some reason it relaxes me.
Now, do that thing Gene Simmons does.
Overstay my welcome for 40 years?
Regrets, eh? This local newsman's had a few.
Covering a town of backwater rubes
who, for some reason, hate my guts.
This is Kent Brockman...
live at the Springfield Peach Parade.
总指挥福兹·佐勒尔
Sir, could you give us eight seconds of your homespun wisdom?
It's a little-known fact that you can get head lice from peaches.
Uh, this is my daughter Peaches.
We'll have more regrets at 11:00 tonight
following an all-new bottle of scotch.
You have regrets,
Mr. "I Get to See the Weathergirl From the Side"!
I made the worst financial decision of all time.
Oh, I can't think about it.
I won't think about it.
I don't want to think about it!
Oh, I'm thinking about it!
2001年初
Oh... that's the coolest bowling ball
I've ever seen.
Hello, Bear Stearns?
I'd like to sell all my Apple stock
so I can buy a fancy bowling ball.
You heard me. Technology is a fad.
Heavy, blue balls are the future.
Now let us text on our ubiquitous Apple tablets and phones.
Oh, you cost me a piece of all that!
Oh, don't cry.
If it makes you feel worse,
I'm the man who bought the stock you sold.
I'll bet a rich man like you has no regrets at all.
Just one.
The girl that got away.
She broke my first heart.
So, is there truly anyone among us without regrets?
I have no regrets.
Really, mother?
Oh, I didn't see you there.
I'm Father O'Greedy.
Dimes for the needy.
Milhouse, are you the bottom half of that mischief?
Oh, my.
My pants, like the Lord, work in mysterious ways.
Return those vestments.
Speaking of return on investments,
my Apple stock is up 3,500%.
Aw, you misheard that on purpose!
Tithe denied! Tithe denied!
Mm. Must find way... to blame myself.
Um, it says I should give you lumbar support.
Better go to the lumber yard.
"Lum- bar." It means "lower back."
How many times will you make that mistake?
Just put on the KISS record.
Which one?
Anything from Love Gun.
Hey, book, are you expecting this?
And while I'm at it...
Burn, dumb, helpful books.
That is a good fire.
You're going down, Bart!
Ah, reckless youth.
He'll be okay.
I was referring to him.
I had a spring in my step like that once.
Back when I met Lilah.
Lilah ran a little crepe stand in the seventh arrondissement.
Oh, Monty,
looking at you,
I could lie in this unheated garret forever.
There's heat. I just don't turn it on.
Seeing you there, in the sweet light of Paris between the wars,
there's a question I must pose.
I have something for you.
Oh! Not that.
Wrong box. Lilah, will you take that big step
from cousin to wife?
Oh, Monty, you must promise me one thing.
Anything she wanted I was willing to do.
Anything, except...
All I ask is that you set aside
five minutes a day to think of others.
When you say "others," could they be bars of gold?
I shall find another husband
as good as you are evil.
No one's that good.
All I have left is my drawing.
Hm. It looked a lot better in my memory.
Uh, but you know what, Smithers?
I will find Lilah and win her back.
I'll just check with the old gang.
Hemingway!
Picasso.
Matador Juan Belmonte.
And Stalin.
That man could really put pressure on you.
Hello, Kent.
Well, well, well. Rachel Maddow.
Everyone came back for Chip's funeral.
I was flying from DC to New York and, of course,
I had the layover in Springfield.
How's the gang at Channel 6?
Look, let's get this out of the way-- just because we both
worked at Channel 6 and you made it big and I didn't
doesn't mean I'm bitter.
Um, Is that your car?
Maybe.
Kent, I'm gonna tell you
the most important mistake you ever made...
after this break.
So, Kent, that mistake you made,
that fundamental, life-changing error,
that cosmic fail, that...
Just tell me already!
After this break.
You could have come with me,
but you were suckling the dual teats
of infotainment and celebrifawning.
布罗克曼和玛多
So, tell us about your new movie.
It's fantastic.
《溃烂尸骨4: 冲击》主演
The studio let us play in their sandbox.
Great. We have a clip.
No! No, don't show it.
There aren't five good seconds in the whole film.
I'm not a newsman anymore, I'm a geologist.
I keep discovering a new rock bottom.
Kent, I think I found my ticket out of this town.
Or at least to a better Springfield.
You two newshounds working on a story?
How about this?
Mario's down the street
found a rat in their pasta.
When did that happen?
Whenever you want. Eh?
Rachel, can I come?
We can share blazers.
Just follow me.
At Mario's, the picture of Sinatra on the wall
is signed by Frank Junior.
The frame hides the "Junior"!
Someone's been dumping tires in the forest.
Willikers! In my three years of soft news,
I've never seen anything like this.
Those are tires from my ill-fated Krusty Town Car.
It would explode if people gripped the wheel too tightly.
What a scoop!
You're not telling no one.
As the 4:00 P.M. Clown, I have complete control
of the Channel 6 news division.
Local news is a joke.
I'm going to cable.
Cable news!
Bah! People only want news at 6:00 P.M.
from white guys on weekdays,
and black guys on weekends.
We'll see about that.
Yes, we shall see.
About that, things will be seen.
By us.
Kent, you coming?
He ain't comin'.
This little piggy's afraid to leave his cushy
anchorman slop trough.
Could you, uh, phrase that a little more nicely?
Sorry. He "Isn't" Coming.
You'll regret this, Kent.
When I have my own show and you're stuck here
tracking Santa's flight from the North Pole.
"Oh, look, he's over Greenland!"
Don't worry, piggy, you made the right choice.
Eh, it'll burn out in an hour or so.
Look, Burns, I've got the dope on your sweetie.
She's still alive, and she just got over
being mad at you last week.
Lilah's alive?
Yeah, well, uh, she's alive,
but she's a nun.
Married to Jesus, eh? Does he beat her?
Jesus? No, he's a real Eagle Scout, that one.
But your penguin's not a Catholic, she's a Buddhist nun--
spent her life expressing her sexuality with a Zen garden.
Those raked rocks could have been me.
Now, since you're so good at finding things, find the exit.
There is the little matter of my fee.
You're becoming very tiresome.
Who moved my desk?!
Well, here I am. Cable news alley.

Fox News. Is this really how I want
to get back in the big leagues?
Let's see how print journalism is doing.
Sir, do you sell The New York Times?
Sir, we are The New York Times.
And in I go.
Why are you doing this, Bart?
50% attention-seeking,
50% to drop things on people.
He's gonna visit my sky granny.
To work at Fox News, all you have to be able to do
is operate this device.
Now, when a Republican is in trouble...
At the time, I didn't know it was illegal
to sex up a cow on the Capitol steps.
We simply do this.
Now you try.
Sorry, but I just discovered I have some scruples.
I'm going back to my sweet little town
where I can decide what news is.
Like a god.
We've had some good times.
*Memories*
*Rest between the pages of my mind*
*Memories*
*See me through the ages just like wine*
And you sat on the gas pedal when my foot fell asleep,
so I'm getting you shined up nice.

What the...?
That's a ball-proof window, sir.
Would you like me to ask Siri for a nearby hospital?
I'm sorry, I don't see any "Hops petals" near you.
Deleting all contact information.
No, no, I didn't ask you to do that, Siri. I...
Delete confirmed.
Oh. Okay, Bart, be cool.
Calm down, you're not gonna die up here.
家庭聚会
Oh, Monty, I can't believe you found me
after all these years.
I've saved myself for you.
Well, then, uh...
I should disrobe at once.
Housekeeping? Send up a Chinese dressing screen
and one of Firestone's finest vulcanized prophylactics.
Be right back.
Smithers? Which do I take first,
the rhino horn or the tiger tongue?
I have my doubts about both, sir.
Bah! I'll just do it the old-fashioned way.
With my pump.
Just powdering my nose, darling.
Smithers, run down to Sears, Roebuck
and get a five-eighths-inch Phillips head bolt.
Here I am, slowly dying every day
at five, six and eleven.
Help! Help!
Child in danger with exciting visuals!
This kid's corpse could be my magic carpet.
Get me a cameraman!
The movie Up has come horribly to life over Springfield.
A local boy clings to life in a story
我尖叫 我漂浮
that proves this reporter's relevance.
Ay, caramba!
It's Bart!
Pray for a miracle, boy.
God can hear you better from up there.
Dear Lord, please help me land safely.
Or transform this basket into a flying killer robot
that I control with my mind. Amen.
That's not a prayer.
My God says it is.
Oh, I see you're ice-cold with anticipation.
Dead?
Oh, Lilah.
Even at the end, I waited too long.
What if I give her the breath of life?
Oh, boy.
I guess one regret just leads to another.
You know, sir, maybe it would bring you peace
to honor the one thing Lilah ever asked of you.
Here you are, my good man.
A little broth will cure your mental illness.
Sir, that's five minutes.
You can stop thinking of other people now.
You know what, I think I'll give it another five.
I'm proud of you, Monty.
I ain't eatin' that.
Chief, what are you doing to save our son?
Well, I've placed marksmen on the roof
to shoot the balloons one by one,
but frankly they're not very good.
Chief, it happened again.
Aw, come on, guys, spread out. Arm's length.
It's all my fault.
I should never have listened
to those KISS albums when I was pregnant.
Marge, with all due respect, that's ridiculous.
My Sarah listened to Mozart and Churchill speeches
when she was pregnant with Ralphie,
and he can't even open a refrigerator.
Pushing, always... always pushing.
Really?
Oh, yeah. That kid's a mess.
Hey! Only I get to criticize him, Lou.
Kid's scared to flush. Think's it's his brother.
Can we focus on my son up in the sky?
Oh, I've got a long-shot idea.
By which I mean firing a shot over a long distance.
Yeah, you see, if we could fire
an exactly 12-and-a-half-pound weight into the basket,
it would lower the boy very gently to the ground.
Unfortunately, all our cannonballs were melted down
to make a statue of Joe Paterno,
which we changed to look like Eugene Levy.
I think I just might have what you're looking for.
Today I'm glad that I sold that stock.
Uh, Apple closed up another 20 points today.
Why does everyone know?
Because their terrific products keep track of it for you.
And anything else you could ever think of.
That kid's not dying on my watch.
Which ends... right now, fortunately.
Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart!
Bart! Bart! Hmm.
Homer's rising faster than Apple stock.
苹果连广告费都不给
My boy's okay!
Bart! Bart! Bart!
I won the science fair!
I get to go to Chicago!
Bart! Bart! Bart!
Ugh. Bart, Bart, Bart.
You know what I think about regrets?
As long as your family is together,
every choice you've ever made is the right one.
And together we are.
Would you guys knock it off? He's down safe already.
Sorry, Chief, that was me putting it down.
And there you have it-- a family reunited.
And a grateful nation gives thanks for some solid reporting.
Back to you, Rachel Maddow.
Great job, Kent. I think we might have
an opening for you at MSNBC
between our weekend prison documentary block
and the two hours it takes
to make up Joe Scarborough on Monday morning.
No, thanks, Rachel Maddow. I'm happy right here.
No regrets.
