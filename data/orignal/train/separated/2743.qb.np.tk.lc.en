well ...
i &apos;m not 100 % in that department
but i &apos;m startin &apos; to feel the old pressure .

we get drunk and stare .
best @-@ case scenario we go in the back room we get a lap dance
a dry hump and pfft blow in our pants .
listen you wanna fuck her so bad i &apos;m sure it could be worked out .
nah i couldn &apos;t .
but you ...
well what do you want me to say ?

gabriella dante and rosalie aprile came in for lunch yesterday .

i know where your heart is .
i gotta plan the menu for tomorrow .
fasanella my old man &apos;s a meat guy .
he said that the restaurant business was like keeping an elephant .
it costs a fortune and sooner or later it shits on your head .
i miss him .
hector had to trim three inches off the fiorentinas .
great . we can &apos;t even get the good meat anymore .
fucking western beef is leaving us for dead .
i wanted you to call their guy
but you were on the floor talking to the cohens &apos; mother @-@ in @-@ law .
you can &apos;t deal with the western beef guy yourself
my blushing flower ?
it &apos;s not the same from me .
and arthur
the chatting with the guests ...
again that &apos;s it .
it &apos;s not hector or the meat or these assholes
that are always looking for the next hot thing . it &apos;s me .
limit it to a quick visit at coffee .
people wanna talk to each other not you .
really ? you know better than new jersey zagat
&quot; arthur bucco warm and convivial host &quot; ?
yeah we &apos;re here right now .
sure the broad strokes . perfect .
kingsley &apos;s agent says
we grab lunch tomorrow poolside .
that guy jay ?
yeah i got him out of some trouble
on a party yacht down in the keys .
ben kingsley can he do a new jersey accent ?
welcome to the viceroy .
i usually send the bags up hit the bar
decompress a little unless you &apos;re against it .
what are you talking about ?
you &apos;re in aa .
you gave the stewardess an earful when she put down the champagne .
i just don &apos;t wanna make you feel uncomfortable .
relax . i can deal with it .
be careful with this wine
because the way you two are looking at each other
pretty soon we &apos;re gonna have to ...
put a high chair right here .
did you clip the daily @-@ special cards to all the menus ?
hey artie
come here .
you ready to order ?
why you kicking her ass like that ?
if you &apos;re referring to the fact that she &apos;s my employee
and i &apos;m telling her what to do last time i checked that &apos;s the way it works .
she thinks you want her to cry . i said not true .
she told you that ?
&apos;cause you two talk all the time .
yeah . so what ?
so maybe you should hire her .
i know how to treat people .
you &apos;re a people person obviously .
i am .
and when they &apos;re good to me they get treats .
and when they &apos;re not well i got this severance thing i do .
it &apos;s a complete break actually .
i get it .
see &apos; cause you talked around that threat so much i almost missed it .
sorry to interrupt you guys
but arthur you have to plate the salmon .
arthur the kid is a hood okay ?
if he feels protective of his girlfriend
you should just leave it alone .
she &apos;s a slow learner .
she &apos;s a nice girl and as predicted
the customers love her
with her little stories from the old country .
you are just picking on her .
it &apos;s disgusting . he &apos;s a married man .
so it &apos;s 500 for the hour 300 for half .
and if you wanna keep skiing that &apos;s extra .
all right eden how &apos;s about 400 for 40
and four more lines and then we &apos;ll take it from there ?
that &apos;ll work .
fuckin &apos; -a .
those are some amazing tits .
thank you sweetie .
carlo &apos;s running late . route 23 they think there &apos;s a sniper .
listen the other night
it &apos;s this place . you know the rope &apos;s
a little tight at my collar .
down 40 % from last year .
you need a little help ?
from you ? god no .
oh there &apos;s the gratitude i was looking for .
no i mean i &apos;m not at that point thank god .
but thank you .
well listen the other day i was driving along
and i was thinking about your little problem .
how about a little promotion ? a coupon two @-@ for @-@ one ?
two @-@ fers wow .
you mean like you get a free spaghetti and meatballs
if you bring another cheap gomer douchebag in here ?
how about an early @-@ bird special ? salad wagon ?
this is a fine dining establishment . i &apos;ll give it back to the bank
before i turn it into a fucking ihop .
just send the waiter over here .
you wanna help me so badly ? try paying your tab .
excuse me ?
that little roast you and the waste management people threw for dick barone
when he got sick
40 fucking garbagemen from around the country .
of course you paid pat cooper .
you paid the entertainment .
afternoon . we &apos;re looking for arthur bucco .
that &apos;s me .
dave kloski . this is jim hollings .
american express ? funny i had you two for cops .
in a past life . actually we &apos;re here to investigate
some recent irregularities in charge activity here at nuevo vesuvio .
&quot; nuovo . &quot; lrregularities ?
well there is credit card fraud going on in this restaurant .
that &apos;s impossible .
based on cardholder disputes
we show nine hits in this locus that precede fraudulent activity .
what does that mean ?
people &apos;s card numbers were copied
and those numbers were used to rack up thousands of dollars in phony charges .
wait you think i &apos;m ripping off my own customers ? that &apos;s insane .
were these meals actually served ?
shit .
councilman carillo ? that was just two weeks ago .
so you understand we have to suspend
the use of our cards here pending an investigation .
suspend ? you &apos;re cutting me off ?
what &apos;s going on ?
they &apos;re from amex . no more charges .
what ? !
someone &apos;s stealing !
guys this is like 30 % of my business here
and i can &apos;t fucking spare it right now !
artie please don &apos;t curse . the minute you use profanity
you give them the high moral ground to do whatever they please .
we need copies of your reservations
and a list of anyone who has access to customer plastic .
i &apos;m just asking jay .
well tell me again .
why am i meeting with these chaps ?
oh ! oh bollocks jay . uh bollocks !
oh please .
anyway we appreciate that your time
is less than limited so i &apos;ll cut to the chase .
log line &quot; the ring &quot; meets &quot; the godfather . &quot;
wiseguy--murdered i guess you could say
seeks revenge on the man who ordered it .
you would play that man .
which man ?
who are we kidding here ?
you &apos;re ben kingsley . you &apos;d play the boss .
i heard this idea i call jay and i say
&quot; sir ben kingsley no one else . &quot;
well you know as ever it &apos;s script @-@ dependent .
oh we got a sensational writer jt dolan .
i &apos;m embarrassed . i haven &apos;t heard of him .
he &apos;s from tv &quot; nash bridges &quot; &quot; hooperman &quot;
and &quot; law &amp; order the suv . &quot;
so there &apos;s a script ?
we wanted to surmise your interest
and then tailor the part to your specificities .
no one plays a tough ruthless hardhearted prick like you do .
you got it down trust me .
i take that as quite a compliment .
sure . &quot; sexy beast &quot; ?
now we do have a shortlist of directors .
we could go a @-@ list down the horror genre

or a couple of rolls of toilet paper here .
this is our livelihoods .
are you looking at me ?
nobody &apos;s looking at anybody .
i didn &apos;t take the toilet paper .
but the olives ?
i &apos;m joking here .
i &apos;m just saying if you don &apos;t come clean to us
those investigators
well they just might question the honesty
of somebody that wears a coat
pulled from the lost @-@ and @-@ found . -fuck this !
no fuck you !
arthur
i don &apos;t know which one of you pieces of shit did this
but i &apos;ve been good to you !

those companies are huge .
they come on tough but in the end they gotta eat it .
okay .
everything okay in there ?
for once i &apos;d like to eat without you getting a call from work .
ah .
god damn it .
arthur !

hey sir kingsley .
it &apos;s chris moltisanti from yesterday ?
i spoke with jay
and he &apos;s working on that new york meeting right now .
fine but that &apos;s not what i &apos;m calling about though .
that luxury lounge thing can you get me in there ?
i don &apos;t know . my publicist handles all that stuff .
so can you call &apos; em ?
i don &apos;t know
how my publicist can help you you know ?
all right .
yeah in the city then . my partner went back .
friend of his died recently . guy &apos;s wife
is having a breakdown . he &apos;ll call you .
that &apos;s security eden ! they &apos;re gonna blow that door open !
fuck you !
fuck .
i know i gotta get it together .
black truffle doesn &apos;t have the intensity of white so you gotta use more .
i &apos;ll be at my investing club at the learning annex with my cell
if you have to call but try not to .
sandy about the meeting ...
oh everybody knows you &apos;re upset .
i know .
but alonzo &apos;s coat you told me that in confidence .
i thought you needed to know .
i also think well it &apos;s probably nothing
but yesterday martina was showing off these caovilla sandals .
i know she makes more than me
but they cost like $ 600 .
you should get back to the coatroom .
hold on a second . i wanna ask you something .
i knew it .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll pay you back .
how could you do this to me ?
you were so mean to me .
like helping you find the apartment ? teaching you to drive ?
as soon as you found out i wasn &apos;t going to fuck you you started picking on me .
i wanna fuck you ? you certainly have a high opinion of yourself .
you stare at me like food .
well i never fuck you .
i go to benny and we laugh at you ...
benny .
when i fuck him in the pile of money
that we take from your stupid customers .
you &apos;re fired .
oh yeah ? oh who &apos;s laughing now ?
what do you think ? i can &apos;t press charges &apos; cause of my friendship with tony ? !
three months you worked here !
you think that doesn &apos;t go on your permanent record ? !
we lead the world in computerized data collection !
artie you know what time it is ?
we need to talk .
now ?
my wife is pregnant . she needs to sleep .
martina told me about your little credit card business .
step outside ben .
i &apos;ll be outside a minute honey .
look .
you &apos;re upset all right ?
but it &apos;s not my fault that little trick got greedy .
oh so she &apos;s a little trick huh ?
i was gonna cut you in but now you &apos;re acting stupid .
regular people are all fucking stupid .
you want some more ? !
piece of dogshit ! little crazy
motherfucking meatball dogshit !
yeah i &apos;m stupid .
ho ! there he is .
how you doing ?
great thanks .
this is murmur .
you heading to the pool ?
massage .
oh .
listen . you get a chance to call about that luxury lounge for me ?
well it &apos;s like i explained ...
there &apos;s nothing very much i can do about it .
they decide whom they give it to .
very important people
like you right ? &apos; cause you &apos;re a very important person .
to them i guess .
murmur &apos;s an interesting name . what &apos;s the genesis ?
i had a heart murmur when i was a kid .
they just keep handing stuff out huh ?
the coolest shit in the world
to the people who need it the least .
look . i think you &apos;ve misunderstood something .
i give most of that stuff away
to homeless shelters the rest i give to charity auctions .
not to your godson ?
i agree with you
the whole thing &apos;s obscene and it &apos;s nothing
compared to the situation at award shows .
presenters get
about $ 30.000 worth of merchandise in those baskets .
that &apos;s a year &apos;s salary for some people .
go figure .
hopefully we can spread some of that lolly around .
we &apos;ll get you that script .
hell of a tub here guys .
sea sun . i &apos;m gonna make it my second home .
anybody else hungry ? huh ?
we &apos;ll get lunch started .
artie another margarita ?
i could say no but i won &apos;t .
you lost your fucking mind ?
the shit you &apos;re in with that kid which you brought on yourself .
brought on myself ?
oh i suppose you let a certain element into your world you &apos;re asking for it .
oh !
jesus fucking christ tony
how could you pull that scam at my place ?
come on
you know i never would &apos;ve let that happen if i &apos;d known .
you &apos;re innocent i get it .
i &apos;m just another victim of benny fazio criminal mastermind .
that &apos;s right .
and once you found out instead of putting him in the e. r.
you should &apos;ve come to me . he says he &apos;s gonna kill you artie .
i can &apos;t take american express now ton &apos; .
you know what that means ? i have to start with the fucking two @-@ fers .
my accountant insisted . are you happy ?
life &apos;s not fair . right i know .
but somehow i believed my dad &apos;s crap about honest work .
he used to say to me &quot; you &apos;ll see .
pays off in the end . &quot;
what a joke .
i hate to see you like this you know that .
&apos;cause you start thinking crazy shit .
who &apos;s hungry ?
yeah ?
ben kingsley passed .
fuck .
you know i tried to be his friend
i sent a muffin basket with the script
i tried everything .
you can kill me after if you want
but he &apos;s a fucking dead man .
calm down ben .
he came to my house tony where my wife was watching tv .
my wife who &apos;s carrying my unborn son .
i &apos;m gonna take him to that warehouse in paterson
and drive fucking ...
nails into his balls . i know .
i heard you the first time .
you &apos;re having a son huh ?
they showed us his cannoli
on the ultrasound like a month ago .
that &apos;s beautiful .

i go about in pity for myself ?
yeah .
i gotta tell you bodhisattva
that is fucking priceless .
use the other door .
you bitch and you moan and you blame
everybody else for your problems
instead of maybe ... not letting the mexicans do all the cooking for you
or i don &apos;t know changing the menu or changing the decor .
i guess because you know how to eat you know how to run a restaurant .
on one of the bleakest nights of my life
after the shit with my mother and that fuckin &apos; storm outside
i came here to this place .
i sat out there with carm and my two kids
and we ate and we drank and we were so happy to be here
more than any other place in the world .
and you know i &apos;m gonna eat here until i fall off the chair .
but in business sometimes shit happens .
the playing field changes whatever .
and you gotta do whatever you gotta do to keep your dick up .
if you hate it here so much why don &apos;t you go to da giovanni ?
see if he &apos;ll cook you that bland shit for your shot @-@ up pancreas .
i &apos;ll tell you one thing
and this is very hard ...
nobody wants to hear you talk .
they &apos;re trying to eat out there and you come along
with your corny jokes and your stupid stories .
just stay in the kitchen .
that &apos;d be a start .
hey .
you wouldn &apos;t believe what these people in the business get
totally fuckin &apos; absolutely gratis .
yeah i hear the streets are paved with hand jobs .
right . i scored some major swag .
a little taste for you .
trip to australia first @-@ class vouchers

looks like sarasota .
after what a 20 @-@ hour flight ? no .
that &apos;s for a pocket dog .
how &apos;d it go with the movie star ?
he was all over us but i don &apos;t think he &apos;s right .
we made some great contacts . plus we saw lindsay lohan .
total piece of ass .
you hear artie burned his hand ?
yeah . him and benny . how crazy is that ?
he okay ?
a layer of skin
came off his hand like a glove .
but they said you know no scarring no grafts .
lucky .
hmm .
well not for nothin &apos; . i couldn &apos;t help but thinkin&apos;
if you were here watching your crew
things wouldn &apos;t have gone the way they did .
you let me go t.
i asked you . now it &apos;s my fault artie and benny got into it ?
this is what i was concerned about christopher the loss of focus .
