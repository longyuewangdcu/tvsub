You know how much I love you, Amanda?
Infinity?
Well, infinity...
times infinity.
In another life, my name was Amanda Clarke.
You're barely gonna notice the cold at all.
I was raised by my father David...
Are you ready?
Until the day he was convicted for a crime he didn't commit.
Federal prosecutors wrapped up their case for treason
against disgraced hedge fund executive David Clarke.
Grayson's testimony detailed the scheme
Clarke used to channel money to the terrorists
responsible for the downing of flight 1-9-7.
I grew up on my own and changed my identity.
I'm now known as Emily Thorne,
And I've spent my whole life acquiring the skills
to exact revenge on those who destroyed my father.
I've learned that vengeance is not for the impulsive
and that anger must be tempered with skill.
This is the story of my road to revenge
from the beginning.
Coming back to the Hamptons after so many years
felt like coming home.
But it was also the place where I last saw my father.
Daddy!
Whoa! Whoa! What's going on?
Hands up so I can see 'em.
What's going on?!
You're making a mistake.
You're making a mistake!
Daddy!
Get your hands off my daughter!
Amanda! Amanda!
Now you have to imagine,
it's memorial day weekend,
75 and sunny,
all those boys of summer wondering who the new girl is.
An air of mystery can be very useful when plotting revenge.
And I would use it to my advantage.
I'll take it.
Hello, hello.
Ashley, hey. Should I get us some glasses?
I wish. It's for Victoria Grayson.
Who?
You are hopeless.
Victoria Grayson, the reigning queen of the hamptons.
Not to mention your new next door neighbor.
Queen Victoria.
Mm. Believe me. She's earned the title.
In truth, Victoria Grayson was no stranger to me.
She and my father were in love and carrying on an affair
until an even greater scandal erupted.
I've made a terrible, terrible mistake.
It was Victoria's husband Conrad
who had been laundering money for the terrorists
responsible for the plane crash.
The investigation's gonna tie it back to the company.
I'm gonna go to prison for the rest of my life,
if I'm lucky.
They're gonna freeze all of our assets,
and you're gonna have to raise Daniel alone
under a cloud of disgrace.
Afraid of losing everything,
Victoria helped hatch a plan to frame my father...
And changed the course of our lives forever.
Amanda!
Daddy!
I grew up in institutions and foster homes
and was told nothing but lies.
You know you will never see that man again,
because he hurt people,
because he killed people.
That's a lie.
If you don't stop challenging me on this,
you might wind up spending the rest of
your childhood in this place.
It was only upon my release from juvenile detention
that I learned the truth.
Who are you?
Nolan Ross. Friend of your father's.
You're not exactly the little angel he described.
My father hasn't seen me in ten years.
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.
He passed away...
six weeks ago.
He wanted you to have something.
Your father was the first person to believe in me.
He invested in my company when no one else would.
Now that you're 18,
you're officially 49% owner of my company.
"My dear Amanda.
I am not the man they say I am.
And I did not do the things they say I did.
All I ask is that you promise to do
The one thing that's been so hard for me to do.
Forgive."
But that was a request I could not grant.
Using the evidence left behind by my father,
I began to take down everyone
who had helped bring about his downfall.
I'm Lydia Davis.
My husband and I own the house you're staying in.
Oh.
Welcome to the Hamptons.
Lydia Davis was one of many
who gave false testimony against my father.
She was an employee at Grayson Global.
I'm just glad I can help put that monster away.
Now she was Conrad Grayson's mistress
and Victoria's best friend.
The importance of preparation cannot be underestimated.
I had everything I needed to expose the affair.
Set it up by the windows, please.
They say revenge is a dish best served cold.
And I'd like some, uh, pepper in my bisque.
But sometimes it's as warm as a bowl of soup.
Conrad!
Is he gonna be okay?
Ma'am, I need you to step back, please.
Where are you taking him?
Southfork Hospital.
Lydia.
One, two...
Emily Thorne.
three.
My--my god. Is this your husband?
Do you need a ride to the hospital?
No, I don't. I...
Oh, my God, Conrad. I thought I was going to find you dead.
I'm fine.
As far as I can tell,
your husband's as healthy as a thoroughbred.
But I do suggest that he stay away
from the Southfork Inn's spicy bisque for a while.
The Southfork Inn?
Yeah.
It wasn't long before Victoria and I had our first encounter.
Mrs. Grayson, I just wanted to introduce you
to a dear friend of mine.
Victoria Grayson, Emily Thorne.
Hello, Mrs. Grayson.
Ah, Ms. Thorne.
Lydia, hi.
Emily is renting my house for the summer.
We met briefly on the beach.
And then yesterday at the Southfork Inn.
I hope your husband's feeling better.
Good afternoon, everyone,
and happy memorial day.
I'd like to announce the winner of the art auction.
My dear friend...
Lydia Davis.
Have Ms. Davis escorted off the boat.
And in related news, Lydia has asked me
to announce that the beach house she shared with her husband
is officially on the market.
Ms. Davis? Come with me, please.
I'm afraid this will be her final weekend in the Hamptons.
So call your realtors, ladies and gentlemen,
because this one's going to go fast.
Ruining Lydia was my first step in taking down the Graysons,
but my plan ran much deeper.
Oh, my God. Oh!
I'm so sorry. God, I'm such an idiot.
No, don't worry about it.
It's, uh, probably the universe
telling me i need a costume change.
Uh... I'm Daniel.
Emily.
How about I get you a dry martini?
Twice the alcohol, half the stain potential.
Sure. I'm sorry.
No, no. It's okay. Now wait right here.
Daniel was the Graysons oldest child,
the heir to their misbegotten fortune.
Daniel.
Your father and I are leaving.
Thank you for a lovely party, Mrs. Grayson.
It was great meeting both of you.
Well, now that you've moved in next door,
I suppose we'll be seeing a lot of you this summer.
Getting close to Victoria's only son...
I'll expect you shortly, Daniel.
would give me the leverage I needed.
Don't let my mom rattle you.
Intimidation is practically a sign of endearment with her.
I'd hate to be on her bad side.
Yes, you would.
When seeking revenge,
you must be prepared for the inevitable.
Yes?
I want you to find out everything you can
about a young woman named Emily Thorne.
Your greatest adversary may be planning the same fate for you.
Moments ago, a jury found terrorist...
My mission to avenge the injustices of the past
was off to a productive start.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the Thorne in everyone's side.
And someone from that past
would prove to be a useful resource.
With his loyalty to my father and technical brilliants,
Nolan was the perfect accomplice.
Is it possible to hack a computer tablet
to run a powerpoint presentation?
Possible for you or possible for me?
Can you do it or not?
With both hands tied behind my back.
One by one, with Nolan's help,
those who played a part in the plot against my father fell.
A state psychiatrist placed me in an institution
after Victoria offered her a private practice
with wealthy clients.
I exposed their secrets at a society party...
I drove my children to summer camp
loaded on painkillers and Vodka.
finishing the doctor's career in one stroke.
I am going to destroy you.
After my father's trial,
the federal prosecutor who convicted him
rose to political prominence.
How'd you get your hands on a sex tape?
I bought the building that his mistress lives in.
As part of the renovations, I had cameras installed.
You scare me.
Good.
With a few more pawns overturned,
I moved further into the queen's territory.
Go, Daniel!
Go, Daniel! Go, Daniel!
Off to a rough start, huh?
Ah, I was hoping you wouldn't be here to see this.
You know, you're making it very difficult for me
to impress you.
I'm already impressed.
Would you like to go out sometime?
Riding?
Yeah, riding or...
Just dinner.
Win the match, and it's yes to both.
And if I lose?
Then we'll see.
Thanks for meeting me, Frank.
What were you able to find out?
Filthy rich and squeaky clean as far as I can tell.
Why are you so interested in this girl anyway?
Because she's interested in my son.
Daniel mentioned that
you were captain of an equestrian team in Barcelona.
Uh, yes. Just for a semester.
What are some of your other interests?
History for one.
I'm practically obsessed with it.
Emily?
Hi.
Hi. What's going on?
Well, your mother invited me over for tea.
I should get going, really.
I have to work out some issues with my realtor.
I've just become the official new owner of the beach house.
That's great news. Congratulations.
Thank you.
Now how about I make good on that date
and take you out to celebrate?
That sounds great. How about tomorrow?
Yeah, tomorrow's perfect.
I know just the place. Come on. I'll walk you out.
Thank you so much for tea, Mrs. Grayson.
I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed this.
But I never waste time enjoying small victories.
Come here.
When you let your guard down,
you become vulnerable...
and your own heart might give you away.
Sammy!
Sam?
Come here, Sammy. I found a stick for you.
What's his name?
Sam.
Fetch it, Sammy.
Nice throw.
Thanks.
Sammy!
Sammy, get down!
What's the matter with you?
Sorry. He's not normally this friendly.
He's kind of an old grump, actually.
Oh, he got mud on your dress.
Oh, that's no big deal.
There's an Earl and Emma's dry cleaners
right around the corner.
I'll walk you over.
Oh, that's okay.
Um, I got it. Thanks.
Despite the pull of lost love,
you must never lose sight of your ultimate objective.
I hope my mother wasn't too hard on you the other day.
I don't scare too easily.
What about your parents?
They passed away when I was a kid.
Car crash.
I'm so sorry.
But maybe you can set down some roots of your own now.
Yeah, maybe.
I had a really good time tonight.
Me, too.
Contending with the element of surprise
is an essential skill in the art of revenge.
Please tell me you're the A.V. guy.
Wish I could.
Tyler Barrol,
Daniel's roommate at Harvard.
Tyler's ambitions were transparent...
My internship at Stern Investments just fell through.
And as usual, their loss is Grayson Global's gain.
When can you start?
You tell me, sir.
Get yourself dressed. You start today.
And he wasted no time
ingratiating himself with the Graysons.
Where's the ledger for the offshore accounts?
Already boxed up, sir.
I don't know where my head's at today.
My goal is to become indispensible to you.
Well, you're fast approaching it, son.
Hey, handsome.
Oops. Thought you were Daniel.
Ah. Sorry to disappoint.
I was just on my way to the fish market,
thought I'd see how Daniel felt about rock shrimp.
Danny's allergic to shellfish.
Well, good thing I was here.
You coulda killed the guy.
You sure know a lot about him.
Yeah, well... Best friends are like that.
Right. Harvard boys.
So, uh, what time do you want him,
7:00, 8:00?
You know what? I'll just give him a call.
Did I just hear Emily?
Yeah. She just took off.
She said that something's come up
and she had to cancel dinner.
She say why?
Sorry.
The calculated moves of my unexpected rival
weren't immediately apparent.
Frustration can cloud your judgment,
and any distraction is welcome.
Emily.
Hi.
These are from Sammy
as a way of saying thank you
for bringing him home last week... twice.
That's very nice of Sammy, but--
Oh. I should've called first.
You-- you're in the middle of something.
Yes, I am in the middle of something.
And that happens to be an exceptionally good bottle of pinot.
Do you drink wine?
Well, when it's exceptional,
sure.
Cheers.
We're all drawn to the warmth of a true connection.
But avoid getting too close to an open flame...
or someone is sure to get burned.
What's my little girl with the infinity tattoo up to today?
Suddenly she's thinking of filing a restraining order.
It wouldn't kill you to try and be nice to me.
Not part of the plan.
That certainly hasn't stopped you
from cozying up to Daniel Grayson.
That's because he actually is part of the plan.
But even the best-laid plans can be disrupted
when a woman scored returns to seek her own revenge.
Michael's attorney presented these to the judge,
and they triggered the fidelity clause in our prenup.
I get nothing.
I am sorry, Lydia.
Really, I- I am, but...
What can I do about it?
You can write me a check...
A big one.
If I'm gonna get my life back,
then I need Victoria to accept me.
Get her on board, Conrad.
Otherwise--
Otherwise what?
Another empty threat?
Empty?
How does this sound?
"The Graysons are incredibly powerful, your honor.
"I was intimidated into helping them frame David Clarke.
And then threatened by their head of security
if I didn't comply."
The prosecution rests."
Thanks to Nolan,
we had a front-row seat to the drama unfolding
between Lydia and the Graysons.
But no one was prepared for how it would escalate.
I tried to reason with her.
Lydia doesn't want money anymore.
The only thing that'll placate her
is if Victoria welcomes her back into the fold.
I am not welcoming that scheming harlot anywhere
until we've exhausted all our options.
Well, there's definitely more aggressive ways
to handle the situation.
Oh, hold on a minute.
She's a lonely socialite. She's not an ax murderer.
Look, Victoria, you asked me to call her bluff once.
I say we do it tonight.
Well, that was before I found out
how completely unhinged she's become.
Who knows what that woman's capable of?
She could be behind everything.
I'll get into it.
But if Victoria's suspicions are right,
we handle this my way.
Victoria, you were right.
Lydia is behind everything.
I just found her Open Arms speech on her computer.
She's planning to expose you tonight.
You have proof of this?
I'm staring at it right now.
She writes, "Ladies and gentlemen,
everyone here tonight is a victim--
a victim of fraud and deceit so dark and despicable
that it has taken me 15 terrible years
to tell the truth about the monsters responsible."
What the hell are you doing here?
It was all you--
destroying Senator Kingsly,
Dr. Banks, extorting Conrad.
You really take this woman scored thing seriously,
don't you?
I don't know what you're talking about. Get out!
Help!
Somebody, help!
Lydia's accident was not part of the plan.
But instead of cleaning up the mess myself...
I let others do the dirty work for me.
Victoria, it's Frank.
Lydia Davis just jumped off her balcony.
Call me when you get this.
Eventually, someone's gonna find you out.
Not if they believe it's all been Frank.
Frank dug his own grave.
All we need is for Victoria and Conrad to bury him in it.
Our man Frank was trying to kill her, Victoria.
There's no reason to believe that he won't do the same
to either of us.
The time has come for us to go our separate ways.
Are you firing me?
I can trust you anymore.
You can't trust me?
You wouldn't be sitting here if it wasn't for me.
You'd be in a federal prison, rotting.
Okay, which is why I wrote a second check in your name.
I suggest you go someplace very far away from here.
Dispensing with complications is a necessary evil.
But matters of the heart require more care.
Ever since I first saw you...
I knew there was something about you.
This feeling comes along once or twice in a lifetime
if we're lucky.
Tell me I'm alone in this,
and I won't bother you again.
I'm so sorry, Jack.
There was no time to dwell on the past
with other affairs to show up.
Beginning to question if you lived here anymore.
Well, then we're even, because I was
beginning to question if you'd lost my number.
Actually, I lost my phone.
Tyler told me you canceled dinner.
What is he talking about?
I came by to see what you like to eat.
I'll kill him.
I stared at an empty chair for two hours
until I finally accepted that you had stood me up.
The chair didn't look so empty to me.
I saw you and Jack through the windows.
I know. I'm not proud of it.
I made that dinner for you, Daniel.
Jack and I are just friends.
He came by unexpected. He was hungry.
I didn't want the food to go to waste.
I'm such an idiot.
And so we're headed to the Berry Islands on a G-5
because, well, they're looking for a tax haven,
And they want me to show them around.
So where do you guys fly into down there?
Most of the airstrips are so short.
Half are unpaved.
I don't know. We just landed.
On a dirt runway in a $60 million plane?
Why would anybody want to hide their money in the Bahamas?
Their privacy laws were stripped in '06.
What's your point?
Either you're confused
or you're giving spectacularly bad advice.
Forget it. I'm just trying to tell a story.
Oh, I believe that.
You know what?
Tyler, come on. Don't be like that.
Who does she think she's talking to anyways?
That's a very good question.
I'm outta here.
Sorry, Ashley.
Tyler--
He is doing everything he can to come between Daniel and me.
I need you to find something for me to use
to discredit him with the Graysons.
Just tell me what the hell you want.
Direct. I like that in my negotiations.
Well, upon some research,
I noticed that all your bills last summer
were paid kept-boy style.
Tell me,
what's a gay hustler doing posing as a Harvard student?
Gay? Eh.
Hustler?
Maybe.
Ambiguous sexual identity.
I get it.
I'm about a...
3 on the kinsey scale myself.
Still doesn't explain what you're up to.
You got me.
You did say this was a negotiation so...
let's make a deal.
I'm impressed. How'd you do it?
well, I can't take all the credit.
I took a page from the angel of revenge herself,
Dug up some dirt, used it for leverage.
What's the dirt?
Suffice it to say
our boy is a bit of a con man.
What he doesn't know is, you can't con a con.
Well, whatever you're doing, keep it up.
Oh, I plan to.
Never underestimate
the lengths to which a desperate man will go.
You looking for this?
This is some serious firepower, Ms. Thorne.
Seems unnecessary.
Well, that depends on what I'm up against.
You work for the Graysons, don't you?
No, not anymore.
Lost my job...
due to some strange events.
There's been a lot of that going around
since you came to town.
At first I thought Victoria was just paranoid about you.
But not anymore.
There's more to your story, little lady...
And I'm gonna find out what it is.
With a little digging...
ghosts from the past can be conjured from thin air.
Hello, Emily Thorne.
It's when they become flesh and blood
that the real problems arise.
$50 for the lap dance.
Actually, um, I just want to talk.
You're one of those.
It's your money.
What do you want to talk about?
Your name's not really Amanda Clarke, is it?
It's Emily Thorne.
So here's the way that I see it--
The girl passing herself off as Emily Thorne
needed a new identity.
And who better than her orphaned cell mate
straight out of juvie?
I'm sure she gave you what seemed like
a lot of money at the time.
Half a million dollars?
This is your fake I.D. and passport.
You're not having second thoughts, are you?
Only if that check bounces.
It won't.
Does anyone else know you found me?
Not yet.
My shift's over in an hour.
Meet me in the parking lot?
Hello.
Your suspicions were right all along.
Emily Thorne is not who she claims to--
Frank?
Frank, are you there?
Frank!
Oh, God. It's really you.
I need you to keep an eye on somebody for me.
I left my old friend in safe hands for a time
while I made a plan
to get rid of her as fast as possible.
But I wasn't fast enough.
Enjoying the show?
I should have known that Amanda
would take advantage of any opportunity that came her way.
So that's the famous Jack Porter.
All the stories you told me about him in juvie,
I feel like... I already know him.
Get inside. This isn't a game.
I never said it was.
And in case you forgot,
I don't like people telling me what to do.
Nothing's more dangerous than someone who knows
everything about your past,
especially when she can use it as her own.
Is there any chance you might stick around
A little while longer?
I want to.
But, um, it's complicated.
Yeah.
Nolan said as much.
Nolan isn't a friend of mine.
Not really.
He knew my father many years ago.
So did you.
Amanda?
I want to come home, Jack.
Multiple code reds, Ems.
The talented Mr. Hamptons
did a web search on David Clarke.
You think he's onto you?
I should never have trusted you to take down Tyler.
Hey, I can handle Tyler.
Then handle him.
With so much beginning to unravel...
I needed guidance.
Years ago, I met a man who trained me...
in the ancient ways of revenge.
It's time you come to Japan.
He returned to help me again.
This is Satoshi Takeda.
He is the C.E.O. of Japan's largest renewable resources company.
I learn something new about you every day.
I fear I'm losing control.
As you were warned,
revenge is a stony path.
Remember,
inside the viper's nest
you must be a viper, too.
How can I be of service?
The task in front of you requires
absolute focus.
If you let your emotions guide you,
You will fail.
With a renewed sense of purpose,
I did what was necessary to remove another obstacle.
The only reason that Nolan invested with your father
was because Tyler's blackmailing him.
Blackmailing him with what?
It's come to my attention, you garnered Mr. Ross' support
through less-than-honorable circumstances.
You're fired.
You need to go.
Now.
Step ahead of you.
I got myself a ticket back to Cali tonight.
I thought maybe you could come with me.
Come on. We're best buds, remember?
We're nothing, Tyler. We're done.
That's impossible.
We know way too much about each other.
And I know way too much about your family.
Are you threatening me?
Have a nice life, Danny.
A birthday party in Daniel's honor
was the perfect occasion to introduce Victoria
to the young woman everyone thought was Amanda Clarke.
What brings you to town?
I just came for a visit.
But I'm thinking of making it more permanent.
If everyone would head down to the beach, the food is ready.
It was a delightful evening in the making...
Where on earth is Emily?
Ah, there she is.
Happy birthday...
But there was another surprise guest.
Come on, people. Yes. Big finish.
Happy birthday, dear Daniel.
Happy birthday to you.
Make a wish.
How 'bout a party game, huh?
Let's call it
Truth or die?
Okay, Conny. You're up first.
You have three seconds to tell everyone the truth
about what really happened to David Clarke,
or I swear, once again, someone is going to die
because you were too weak to own up to your lies.
Question is... Who?
Get off of me! Let me go!
Man, you're not going anywhere.
I knew that Tyler's recklessness
would eventually lead to his own collapse.
When the sand settled, it was time to get back to work.
After my father was imprisoned,
he was eager to tell his side of the story
to an impartial listener.
"I thought Mason Treadwell
would be that person."
and so did I.
I'm here because your father says he's innocent.
I don't think he did it.
I don't either.
Treadwell made it seem like I could rescue my father
by telling him what I knew.
But the Graysons made sure
that the book corroborated their story instead.
My father's name was dragged through the mud again.
And no element of his story has been born out by facts?
Not a shred.
Amanda met with Treadwell
to give him a much-anticipated follow-up interview.
Finally, I could say my piece.
You didn't print a word of what I said to you.
I told you the truth,
that I had seen my father and Victoria Grayson together.
You were a child.
Your mental state was in question.
I-I couldn't possibly take your word for it.
No.
You chose to take hers.
And you were paid handsomely for that endorsement, I'm sure.
One way or another, the truth will come out.
Go, Amanda.
Treadwell had kept the interview tapes
he'd used to write his best seller
under lock and key.
The information on those tapes
could help me accomplish all that I'd set out to do.
No! No.
No!
But there were some surprises in store for me as well.
I'm telling you, six months ago,
Victoria gave birth to a baby girl.
Her name is Charlotte.
Ask her who the father is?
Charlotte had grown up a Grayson.
Her romance with Jack's younger brother Declan
had ruffled feathers.
But discovering her real father's identity
would shatter everything she knew.
Still, it was time to reveal the truth.
I planted the Treadwell tapes
where I knew they would be found.
Emily, what are you doing in here?
Jack, I-I'm so sorry.
I... was looking for Amanda.
She was, uh,
whe was summoned to the Grayson Manor
for tea with Victoria.
Why don't you cut the crap
and tell me what I'm really doing here?
Mason believes that you have
some sort of vendetta against us.
And this dovetails very nicely
with this uncanny sense I have
that his house didn't just burn down accidently.
Word on the street is,
you lit that match so you could pin it on me.
Is that so?
Commitment is built on compromise.
Emily Thorne, will you marry me?
Yes.
Becoming Daniel's wife would make me a Grayson,
but it would also grant me
ultimate access to what I wanted most.
Our engagement party would bring everyone together
for what was sure to be an unforgettable evening.
When Jack discovered one of the Treadwell tapes,
he saw the little girl who still had a hold on his heart.
Find the lady with the dark hair.
She was there the night they took him away.
They kissed on the lips all the time.
Do you know the name of this woman?
Victoria.
Sometimes the lies we tell
aren't nearly as useful as the truth.
The Graysons framed my father.
They were responsible for that plane going down.
They set him up to take the fall.
I came back to avenge my father's death
and to take everything away from them.
You need to go to save yourself...
and Jack.
I can't say good-bye to him.
Then I'll do it for you.
You couldn't just leave her the hell alone.
Jack, I--
Excuse me. Porter, we're kinda in the middle
of a family dinner here, so--
Back off, Grayson.
Mr. Porter, you have some nerve coming here.
I've got some nerve? What did you say
to Amanda Clarke to make her leave town?
Obviously, you've been misinformed.
As misinformed as David Clarke was
when Amanda saw you kissing him?
You have an active imagination.
Who needs imagination?
I've seen the videotape.
If you don't stop telling lies about Amanda Clarke,
I'm gonna start telling the truth about you.
Jack.
Hey, wait up.
Mom, what is he talking about?
Somebody better tell me what's going on right now
or I swear--
Charlotte, sweetheart, you said
that you could handle anything as long as you have me.
Well, you have me, always.
And it's time you know the truth.
David Clarke isn't just Amanda's father.
He's your biological father as well.
No.
Charlotte...
Later that evening...
there would be another surprise.
Emily Thorne.
Tyler.
Excited for the party tomorrow night?
You'll never get close enough to find out.
Stay by your phone.
Oh, and if you do anything rash, like, uh,
cancel the engagement party or call the cops,
you can kiss your friend here good-bye.
Amanda?
On the surface,
our engagement party looked like a great celebration.
Where's Daniel?
He's walking the beach. We're having a thing.
But before the night was over...
someone would be dead.
So what, you're just gonna...
kill Emily?
No.
Emily is gonna kill Daniel.
Or at least, that's how it will appear to the cops.
Now why don't you...
get dressed?
I'm not going to the party.
Don't worry. I won't get in your way.
I can't take that chance.
Fire and ice,
beginnings and endings,
and the love between a man and a woman.
She's not worth it.
Let's take a walk down to the shore.
Shall we?
And though we've only known Emily for a few short months,
she already feels like a piece of the family puzzle
we never even knew was missing.
Where the hell is my son?
Mom! Mom!
My brother!
Daniel!
Daniel!
Daniel!
Daniel. Daniel, baby, please.
Daniel, wake up, please.
Baby, please!
It's Tyler.
Stand back, please.
Mom?
Oh, my god.
oh, my god.
I...
Don't say a word.
You should have heeded my warning.
What did you do?
What happened on the beach?
You won't get away with this, Tyler.
Sure I will, but Emily won't.
Stay back!
Maybe you should call Emily first.
She's a wolf in sheep's clothing, you idiot.
Please help me.
No!
Daniel Grayson,
you're under arrest for the murder of Tyler Barrol.
Vengeance always comes at a price.
And those who deserve to suffer most...
Take your hands off my son!
aren't the only ones who pay.
Tyler was shot three times.
Once in the chest. Twice in the back.
I didn't shoot Tyler in the back.
How do you know?
I thought you said you blacked out.
I saw someone in a dark hoodie
hiding behind the saw grass.
I don't know. It could've been a hoodie.
It could've been anything,
Like a guest from the party. It's hard to say.
When you and Tyler struggled,
where did he hit you?
Right here on the side of the head.
There's a hematoma on the back of your head.
That's a hard spot to reach if you're fighting face-to-face.
We can use it to float the theory
there was a third person on the beach
that knocked you out,
set you up.
You're rich. Who hates you?
Disgruntled investors, hostile competitors...
Amanda Clarke.
Ah. Great.
Where can we find her?
I need you to think hard
about that person you saw on the beach.
You might remember things that you don't realize.
Do you understand me?
Your brother's life may depend on it.
I should never have brought you so deep into this.
Well, it's a little late to put that genie back in the infinity box.
Anyway, we have more pressing problems.
The Graysons are on a mission to find Amanda.
Until they do, they're gonna be looking for a fall guy
closer to home.
Jack.
I can have your boat fixed and ready to go by nightfall.
Running away is not gonna solve anything.
And I gotta find Amanda before the Graysons do.
Yeah, how are you gonna do that?
I don't know yet.
I want it clear,
in my courtroom, justice has no price tag.
Given the serious nature of this crime,
I hereby deny bail...
for Daniel Grayson...
And order him to be remanded
to the maximum security correctional facility on Rikers Island.
I've learned that in the pursuit of revenge...
collateral damage cannot be avoided.
Some truths must be buried in service of greater ones.
You gotta do something.
Can you stand by as others bear the consequences
of what you have set in motion?
