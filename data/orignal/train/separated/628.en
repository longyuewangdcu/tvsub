Daddy.
When I was a child,
my father was framed for a crime he didn't commit.
Daddy.
Amanda.
We need to get our stories straight
in case her memory does return.
The guy had it out for you.
You didn't have to kill him.
Frank admitted trying to kill Lydia for you.
Did you fix the phone?
Put it on your porch,
and Frank's wallet.
Our problem is,
we've been playing way too nice.
Amanda's on a flight to Paris tonight.
I think I might just stay a while.
I was the last person in this house to defend you, mom,
and now you've lost me, too.
It's been written that a lover is apt
to be as full of secrets from himself
as is the object of his love from him.
For my father,
the secrets withheld by the woman he loved
proved powerful enough to destroy him.
I'm just now beginning to understand
the enormity of that burden.
Hey there, early bird.
No swim this morning?
No, just enjoyed the sunrise.
Did you sleep well?
Better than you, I'm guessing.
I heard you get up in the middle of the night again.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm still getting used to someone sleeping next to me.
You got any plans today?
You're looking at 'em. Why?
Grayson Global does this
"Business by the beach" thing every summer.
It starts off with an employee volleyball game this afternoon.
And all this time, you thought you would hate this job.
Well, the jury's still out,
but I did tell my dad I'd at least give it a shot, so...
can you come back me up?
Always.
Okay, thank you.
Ashley?
Lydia, everything okay?
Bring me my wheelchair.
Shall I get Mrs. Grayson?
No.
Help me find my phone. I need to call Conrad.
Okay.
Lydia, what on earth?
The doctor was very specific about keeping you rested.
I'll take it from here.
Yes, Mrs. Grayson.
Oh, and, Ashley,
I've e-mailed you an updated list of her medications.
So will you please call them in
and bring them here as soon as possible?
Yes, Mrs. Grayson.
Hey, beautiful.
Want to watch me crush Daniel
in a round of corporate volleyball?
I would love to,
but I have to run errands for little Mary Suicide.
The queen's treating her like a broken baby bird.
It's positively unsettling.
You have all day to run errands.
Come cheer me on.
I'll meet you down there.
That boat's almost as handsome as her captain.
Kara, hey.
So, uh, who's Amanda,
an old girlfriend?
Ah, it's more like a childhood crush.
So did you stay at Nolan's last night?
Nah. I found a motel not too far from here.
You sail?
No.
But I make a hell of a passenger.
All right. Well, listen, I gotta open up the bar,
but if you feel like hanging out,
I'll take you for a spin around the harbor after lunch.
All right?
I'd like that.
So would I.
A spin...
海边拓展活动周
Look alive, Ty!
Side-out, bitch.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, listen to the new guy, huh?
Nice.
All right. Come on. Who's serving?
Notice how the boys managed
to get us rooting for opposing teams again.
Well, Tyler's nothing if not competitive.
More like driven.
Speaking of...
You didn't let the grass grow under your bum
before shacking up with his Royal Gorgeousness.
We are not shacking up.
He's just staying with me for a little while
until things settle down for him at home.
Fat chance of that happening anytime soon.
Victoria's been especially nasty
since she kicked Mr. Grayson out
and moved his mistress in.
I swear, these people are barking mad.
No argument there.
Excuse me a second.
Hello.
You've still got a problem, Ems.
Or should I say Ams?
Even I'm getting confused.
Don't tell me she didn't leave town.
Okay, but, uh, I will tell you
she's got a killer bod,
pun intended.
Amanda is on the "Amanda,"
toasting herself as we speak.
Jack's boat?
I don't believe this.
Believe it.
All right, I'll be there as soon as I can.
Get down here fast.
Side-out!
Are you ready for lunch?
I brought you lobster bisque.
I'm not hungry. Thank you.
Victoria, you don't have to keep doing this.
I remember exactly what happened
the night of the benefit.
That's wonderful.
What exactly do you remember?
I remember that you told me you'd never accept me,
and that your hatred ran deeper
than any apology I could ever make.
Excuse me.
South Hampton P.D.
Come in.
Detective Gunther, what is this about?
There's been a development in the Frank Stevens case.
We have a warrant to search your home.
I have a friend convalescing in this room.
I would appreciate it
if your men would refrain from disturbing her.
Well, we won't if we don't have to.
Cell towers picked up Frank Stevens'
phone signal late last night,
and GPS tracked it to inside your property lines.
That doesn't make any sense.
The last time Frank called me was from outside this house.
Mrs. Grayson,
we know that you and Mr. Stevens
had regular contact.
We also know that your husband
abruptly fired Mr. Stevens shortly before
checking into a hotel
the night of the murder.
Would you characterize Mr. Grayson
as a jealous man?
Sir?
I think we found the phone.
What do you think you're doing?
Getting some vitamin d. You?
Why didn't you get on the plane?
I-I-I got through security
and was headed for the gate
when something stopped me.
You should've called.
I did better than that.
I went to your house.
But you were too busy with your boy billionaire.
Well, I'm not busy now.
What's wrong?
I'm tired of running.
I need a break.
You can get a break wherer you want.
Just point it out on a map,
I will get you there.
That's not what I want.
I want a home.
I want friends.
My name's Kara now, so no one has to know the truth.
It's too risky.
For me or you?
You want to talk risky, why are you living in that house?
Look, don't bite the hand that feeds you.
You can't stay.
I don't remember asking for your permission.
Now get outta the way. You're blocking the sun.
Afternoon, Mr. Grayson, Daniel.
Speak of the devil.
Daniel here has been giving me a blow-by-blow
of this volleyball tournament.
Well, not my best showing I'm afraid.
Of course, Daniel practically grew up on that stretch of sand.
A little friendly competition
is good for the soul, don't you think?
Which is why I want both of you to show me what you've got
at the new investor party tomorrow.
First one of you to close a high roller
keeps the full commission,
same as all the rest of the execs.
That's quite an opportunity, sir.
You've made the job easy.
Your firm's returns
doubled the market averages last year.
Yeah, albeit true, that's something my guests
are already fully aware of, Tyler.
What we're selling here
is the Grayson lifestyle.
And it seems, once again,
Daniel may have a slight built-in advantage.
Well, Tyler's been living the Grayson lifestyle all summer.
I'd say he gets it.
Ambition versus nepotism.
Game on.
Gentlemen.
Mrs. Grayson.
Please take my seat.
Thank you, Tyler.
Hello, Daniel.
Mother.
It's all right. We're done here.
See you boys at the new investor party.
May the best young man win.
You better watch yourself.
Yeah?
The police found Frank's cell phone.
It was in our garden.
They're building a case against you, Conrad.
Well, it's a case they're gonna lose, Victoria,
Because that phone had to have been planted.
By whom?
Well, by the same bastard
who hid the camera in Lydia's apartment.
I still have a hard time believing
that you didn't install that camera.
Well, I'm so sorry to disappoint you, my dear,
but I'm innocent on all counts.
And I suggest you start backing me up,
because if I end up getting framed for this,
I'm gonna see to it
that everything you cherish so dearly
is ripped from those greedy little claws of yours.
Careful, Conrad.
You should know by now,
I don't respond well to threats.
Who's that hottie I saw hanging out on the boat?
It's about time you had a new prospect on the radar.
What new prospect?
Your friend Kara.
I guess she decided not to take off last night after all.
What's her story?
Long and complicated.
Look, I don't want to come off like I'm running a block on a buddy,
but, uh, n-o, no, Jack.
Well, you told me never to
take dating advice from you, so--
And that was last week.
Look, Kara's what you'd call a nomad,
doesn't stay in one place for too long, you know?
She didn't have a problem staying half naked
on Jack's boat all morning.
Dec, do me a favor. Watch him.
I'm gonna go see if the lady would care for some refreshments
or some sunscreen.
Tell me the reason my father went to jail.
He laundered money for a terrorist group
that blew up flight 197.
So... how bad is it, when people find out
who you really are?
Uncomfortable if you're lucky.
Some of the nut jobs make a bigger deal out of it than the regular people.
But the worst is when you meet someone
who knew someone who died because of what he did.
How is it that you grew up with a dad like that
and never knew who he really was?
You're not having second thoughts, are you?
Only if that check bounces.
It won't.
Okay, let's move on.
Who's Jack Porter?
The boy you gave your dog Sam to.
Spoiler alert--
your girl talk with Miss Montauk didn't work.
Faux-Amanda is still causing
boats to crash in the harbor.
I know. She doesn't want to leave.
Since when do you take no for an answer?
It's not that easy with her.
I can't just force her to leave.
I have to let her cool down before I approach her again.
Just try to run interference with Jack
until I figure something out.
Fine.
Only 'cause I don't want to see him
get emotionally creamed again...
or worse.
This is your credit card fraud department.
Please verify that the card ending in 6-9-0-6
is currently in your possession.
Oh, Tyler.
Don't you look rich and powerful?
By design, yes.
What's this?
A gift for my date.
And a promise not to stand you up this time.
Are you out of your mind?
Do you know how expensive this is?
That's precisely why I bought it.
Emily will be lost in the crowd next to you.
This party will be the best thing that ever happened to us.
Oh, excuse me.
Hello.
$5,000...
Thank you.
At dresses by vuyo?
Hmm. Exactly what kind of kink are you into here, Ty?
The most expensive kind.
Well, why don't you hop on over and, uh,
bring my stolen credit card with you?
Absolutely. I have some business I'd like to discuss with you as well.
I'll talk to you soon.
Victoria...
What a surprise.
Daniel's not here. He should be back shortly.
Actually, I came to speak with you.
May I come in?
Of course.
I don't imagine I have to tell you
that things between Daniel and myself
have been strained since you've come into the picture.
And I hope you know,
I've never had any intention of getting between you and your son.
And yet, here we are.
May I ask you,
what is it about me that troubles you so much?
Call it maternal instinct.
Okay.
I understand why you might not trust me.
I know I wasn't exactly forthcoming with my juvenile record,
but we all have things in our past
that we wish we could change, don't we?
You missing something?
Oh, yeah. My P.C.
I could've sworn I brought it home.
Well, maybe you left it at the office.
Yeah, maybe. Listen...
Stay for breakfast.
It's time that Amanda get to know you better.
Well, I wish I could,
but I still haven't told Daniel
that I'm leaving his father.
Can we keep it a secret just a little while longer?
Yeah, just a little bit longer.
Don't hurt my son, Emily.
You'll live to regret it if you do.
The last thing I want is for Daniel to get injured in any of this.
Assuming that you feel the same way,
I think it's time that we work out our differences.
Yes, I think we can both do that,
for Daniel's sake.
Victoria...
I'm glad we had this talk.
I really want to make things right between us...
Especially since there's a chance that we could be family someday.
Bye.
My team won, if you're interested.
The volleyball game-- you disappeared on me.
I'm so sorry.
Detective Gunther wanted me to go down and
give a written stement about the night that Frank was killed.
I didn't want to ruin your fun.
They need me to vouch for your whereabouts?
I don't think so, but thank you.
It seems like they're moving on to other suspects.
Look, the fact that they even suspected you at all--
I don't think I'll ever forgive my mother
for putting you through that.
You know, she came over this afternoon.
To apologize?
Sort of.
Well, sort of isn't good enough.
Well, it might have to be.
Listen, if you and I are gonna make this work,
you can't continue to let her have all of this power over you,
or else eventually, she's gonna get exactly what she wants.
Which is what?
To separate you
from anyone who could threaten
to take you away from her.
The only way to stop your mother
is to forgive her.
Thank you for the use of your card.
A man's clothes speak volumes.
Mm. So do his actions, which in my estimation,
makes you a common thief.
Well, then by the same logic, it also makes you a liar.
You said you wanted to help me climb the ladder.
You don't want to play this game with me, Ty.
Or can you actually believe that I'm as stupid
as the other people you're conning?
No con, Nolan. I like you.
I thought we had
a mutually beneficial thing going here.
You said yourself, you have more money
than you can wrap your brain around.
Besides,
I have, uh,
every intention of repaying you.
Transaction denied.
Cash only.
Well, then cash you shall have.
All you have to do is become a client at Grayson Global,
through me, of course.
There's an investor recruitment party tomorrow at the house.
And it will only cost you $20 million.
Oh, is that all?
Pass.
Why don't you think about it a little more
while we take a dip in the pool?
You go ahead.
I'm meeting a friend.
Jealous. Who's the lucky guy?
Someone who's never asked a thing of me.
And...
try not to steal anything while I'm out.
Okay?
Oh, I learned my lesson.
Cross my heart.
The night for what exactly?
Do you mind? This is private.
I do mind.
As charming as you find that boy,
he's not the young man for you.
Yeah, because you're such an expert in the subject.
It's my life, not yours.
If you're looking for your car keys, you won't find them.
What are you doing? Give me my phone back.
You can't do this.
I just did.
Victoria...
We need to talk.
You need to rest.
You've made such great progress today,
I'd hate to see you relapse.
Good. I'm going out for a little while,
but I'll be back in an hour or so.
I'll check up on you then.
Hey, uh, I'm gonna go upstairs and get ready.
If Charlotte gets here before I come down,
send her up, okay?
You got it, Casanova.
Cute.
And he knows it.
You okay on your drink?
Couldn't be better.
You're playing with some serious fire here, missy.
My advice?
Take the money, and ease on down the road.
Sorry. I like it here.
You know, she told me about you.
Said you used to visit her father in jail
like a demented stalker.
In case you hadn't noticed,
she wants you gone.
And when Emily wants somebody gone...
believe me, they go...
and usuay in spectacular fashion.
In case you haven't noticed,
I do things on my own terms.
If Emily wants me gone,
she might have to consider the ripple effect.
Where'd Kara go?
I told you, pal, she's a nomad.
I'm outta here.
Victoria Grayson at the Stowaway?
What did you put in my drink?
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Declan Porter.
I'm victoria Grayson, Charlotte's mother.
I'm Declan's brother Jack.
Is Declan here?
He's upstairs.
If it's all right, I'd like to have a word with him.
Sure.
Mrs. Grayson. What are you doing here?
What's your number?
What's my number?
How much will it cost
to get you to stop seeing my daughter?
Are you freakin' serious?
I am freakin' dead serious.
Everybody's got a price. What's yours?
Look, Mrs. Grayson...
I care about your daughter a lot more than
I care about your money.
I believe you.
You're an impressive young man,
and I understand why Charlotte likes you.
I like you, too.
Time and experience
would tell you that, one way or another,
this romance is going to end.
And I'm trying to spare Charlotte the inevitable heartache
and help you at the same time.
But I can't if you won't accept my offer.
So what's your number?
"Ladies and gentlemen,
everyone here tonight is a victim.
The ruthless monsters-- Conrad and Victoria Grayson."
Andrew Rutherford--
He loves to golf, has three kids,
worth $865 million.
$20 mil's pocket change for him.
I'm curious.
Why haven't you ever ask me for my business?
You really need an answer to that?
Well, I just don't want to miss the boat
for when you become a big, huge success.
But imagine the favor I'm doing you
if it turns out I'm no good at it.
Mm. You're a Grayson.
Making money is in your D.N.A.
Yeah, like mad science to the Frankenstein's.
For whom the bell tolls.
I'll be right back.
Hello?
Multiple code reds, Ems.
The talented Mr. Hamptons
somehow got hold
of a shredded speech by the unbreakable Lydia Davis.
In it, she planned to
take down Conrad and Victoria
at the open arms gala by exposing their role
in the entire conspiracy against your dad.
Are you kidding me?
How did we not know about this?
Well, as I recall, we were a little bit busy that night.
Code red number two--
The speech piqued Tyler's curiosity,
and he did a web search on David Clarke.
You think he's on to you?
More likely,
he's gonna try to blackmail Conrad and Victoria.
Then why is he hitting me up for $20 mil
if he's got a bigger payday planned?
Wait.
You should invest with him.
What? You do it.
Oh, yeah, and how am I gonna explain that to Daniel?
All right. What's the plan?
Just keep Tyler occupied
until we find Lydia's speech.
Commit to the buy-in at the party,
and then you can defund the investment
before the deal closes.
Between Tyler's screaming and
Amanda's homicidal tendencies,
this is a very dangerous game
that we're playing here.
I told you, this is not a game.
God. I should never have trusted you to take down Tyler.
Hey, I can handle Tyler.
Then handle him.
Yes.
It's Emily Thorne.
I need to see you.
Hey, we're headed out for a sail.
Can you open without me?
Yeah, sure. No worries. Have fun.
Thanks.
So...
What did Mrs. Grayson want last night?
That woman scares the pants off me.
Yeah, me, too, and I wasn't wearing any.
All right. You can fill me in later.
After you.
Hey. Did my mom come see you last night?
In a big way. Where were you?
Oh, I'm so sorry. She took my phone.
I left a message at the bar.
What did she say to you?
Yeah, look, Charlotte,
we-- we really need to talk.
Hello, Mr. Grayson.
I've got that. Thank you.
Conrad, where the hell have you been?
Victoria's been keeping me locked up in here like a prisoner.
Well, why didn't you call me?
Because that witch took my phone.
She's been giving me pills.
Just find me the damn wheelchair
and get me the hell out of here.
You mind if I take over?
Go for it.
You got what you wanted.
Declan just broke up with me.
Sweetheart, are you all right?
No.
I'm going to the movies with Jill and Becca.
I need to be around friends right now.
Charlotte...
I know how difficult this must be for you to understand,
but in the long run,
it really is for the best.
I love you.
Can I have my keys back?
Of course.
My parents took me to Disneyland Tokyo when I was little.
I've been wanting to go back ever since.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, you're just in time.
This is Satoshi Takeda.
He is the C.E.O. of Japan's largest renewable resources company.
This is my girlfriend-- Emily Thorne.
He says you're a lucky man.
She is very beautiful.
I learn something new about you every day.
Hai.
What--what did he say?
Uh, he said he's tired of using his translator,
wanted to maybe go to the bar
and see why I speak Japanese so well.
By all means.
She's a woman of many surprises.
I fear I'm losing control.
As you were warned,
revenge is a stony path.
Remember...
Inside the viper's nest,
You must be a viper, too.
How can I be of service?
No. Daniel's got one more year at Harvard.
I didn't exactly knock his socks off, did I?
Mr. Takeda was very impressed by you.
Mm. Right.
Must have been my extensive knowledge of Disneyland Tokyo.
Well, if you change your mind, here's my card.
Best of luck with the grandkids.
Nice meeting you.
Same.
They seem like they only came for the free food and drink.
Uptight bastards.
No, don't sour. Move on to the next.
Yeah, you're right.
Would you mind grabbing me a drink?
Make it a stiff one.
You got it.
I didn't think you'd show.
I'm still conflicted.
Look, Nolan, don't string me along
if you're not planning to invest.
There are dozens of potentials here that I can be talking to.
You must have some cast-iron cajones
to ask me to open my checkbook after you stole from me.
It's shocking and admirable all at the same time.
What is it you want, Nolan?
You wouldn't have come down here
if you didn't have something on your mind.
What's say we continue this negotiation in private?
Follow me.
You do make a handsome couple.
There's no denying that.
Is that really your best attempt at saying you're sorry?
No.
I'm afraid the strain of things with your father
has gotten to me.
My apologies, Emily.
I hope you'll forgive me.
Apology accepted.
Thank you.
Well, I'll leave you two alone.
Be nice to your mom.
She's the only one you'll ever have.
I can see how happy she makes you.
That said, I hope you'll consider returning home
for the remainder of the summer.
With your father gone,
I feel like a bit of a ghost in this house.
You'll be okay, mom.
Just down the beach.
Daniel.
If I'm going to cut you a check tonight,
I'm doing it with a few conditions.
Whatever you want.
Don't ever lie to me or steal from me again.
You have my word.
I'm gonna need a little more than that.
I want us to spend more...
quality time together.
I'm at your service.
Good.
Then I'll have my guy wire the funds to you next week.
Perfect.
You won't regret it.
Hello.
A little thank-you?
Of course.
$20 million of them.
Oh, my god.
Oh, hey, Ash.
Oh, love the dress.
Ashley, wait!
Ashley.
Wait a second.
Ashley, stop. Please.
Ashley, wait. Look, let me explain.
What I just saw does not need an explanation.
It's not what you're thinking.
Clearly, I haven't been thinking since the minute we met.
I'm such an idiot, and you're a bastard!
No, I'm whatever I need to be, whenever I need to be it.
Look, I thought we agreed to step up our game.
Well, I didn't realize you meant
a game of tonsil hockey with Nolan Ross.
It's a small price to pay for his $20 million.
Anyway, the real question is, what are you doing?
All I see is, "Yes, Mrs.Grayson.
Of course, Mrs. Grayson."
You really want to be her lackey for the rest of your life?
No, of course not.
Well, then stop acting like one
and get in the game like everyone else.
There you are.
You mind if I steal this gentleman away?
Please do.
Tyler.
Daniel,
Mr. Takeda had nothing
but good things to say about you.
However, he's not willing to commit just yet.
Tyler, I just spoke with Nolan Ross,
and he is buying in for $20 million.
Congratulations.
That's terrific news, sir.
You'll have your commission check
just as soon as he wires the funds.
Don't... spend it all in one place.
Oh, I won't sir.
Thank you, sir.
Side-out, bitch.
How you doing?
Never been happier.
Want me to take over?
It feels good to be in control of something, you know?
Yeah.
Whenever I'm out here, I get a sense of freedom
that I...
I never feel on shore.
It's like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.
I can't tell you the last time
I felt either one of those things.
Anytime you want to take her out,
she's right here.
And so am I.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You okay?
Sorry. Um...
It's just...
This...
You...
Things haven't been right for me
in a very long time.
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
we're in the same boat.
Is there any chance
you might stick around a little while longer?
I want to, but, um...
It's complicated.
Yeah.
Nolan said as much.
Listen, whatever it is...
I can handle it.
Nolan isn't a friend of mine.
Not really.
He knew my father many years ago.
So did you.
Amanda?
I want to come home, Jack.
Why don't you send Daniel that prospectus,
all right? Okay. Enjoy.
Thank you.
Thank you. Certainly.
I take it you're leaving.
Oh, as soon as I possibly can.
Yeah.
Um, I moved her out earlier this evening
while you were busy stabbing people in the back.
Where did you send her?
Someplace safe,
away from you.
Don't you mean away from us?
Oh, no. There is no...
us, Victoria.
Not anymore.
Hey. Perfect timing.
Did my mother call?
She did.
How much was I worth to her?
Well, I asked for 100 grand,
she countered with $25,000.
She has that in change at the bottom of her purse.
It's a fortune to me.
It means I can get a place by the water.
You and me can get some privacy...
whenever.
How about we start right now?
The caterers just left.
Will there be anything else?
Nothing you can help me with, I'm afraid.
Good night
Why did you hire me?
You're having far fewer parties than last year,
and you've basically made me your personal assistant.
So...
I'm just curious.
All right, then.
I hired you because you're the best at what you do...
and because you're close with Emily.
Well, as close as anyone can be to a person like her.
I see.
Were you surprised that she and Daniel moved in together
so quickly?
No, not entirely.
She knows how to get what she wants.
What do you mean by that?
Just that she can be... tricky.
Let's you and I go to brunch tomorrow.
And we can discuss this further.
Okay. I'll make us a reservation...
Victoria.
Good night.
I'm sorry to stop by so late.
No, it's fine. Is-- is everything okay?
Yeah, everything's...
everything's great.
Remember when I told you about the girl
who used to live here before with her dad?
Yeah, of course.
Okay, well, that friend from Nolan's pool...
She's that girl.
Only she doesn't want anyone to know about it
because her dad wasn't exactly popular around here,
especially with your neighbors.
But I told her--I told her she can trust you.
You mind if I show her the swing that her dad built?
No.
Go right ahead.
Emily...
this is Amanda,
a very close, old friend of mine.
It's nice to see you again, Amanda.
Jack has the nicest things to say about you.
I'm just so happy my home is in good hands.
It was a very special place for me and my father.
It's good to be home.
Thank you.
Take care of yourself.
Thank you again for doing this.
I'd do anything for you.
Stay strong...
Amanda.
You, too...
Emily.
We all have secrets
we keep locked away from the rest of the world...
Friendships we pretend...
Relationships we hide...

Hai. Moshi-moshi.
It's Emily Thorne.
I'm ready to continue my training.
Then it's time you come to Japan.
I'll leave tomorrow.
But worst of all...
is that love we never let show.
