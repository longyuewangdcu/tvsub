Massachusetts!
Listen to this shit.
"New Jersey Council of Indian Affairs has announced plans...
"to disrupt Monday's Columbus Day Parade in Newark.
"Council Chairman Del Redclay Professor of Cultural Anthropology..."
Stop blowing your nose I want to hear this.
..."says council members and supporters will lie down...
"in the path of Columbus Day marchers
in protest of Columbus' role in the genocide...
"'of America's native peoples.'
"To launch their protest the Native Americans and their sympathizers...
"plan to begin a deathwatch tomorrow
"over the statue of Columbus in Christopher Columbus Park "
Some fucking balls bad-mouthing America especially now
I thought that Columbus was the hero of America
See it's these Indians and the Commie fucks
They wanna paint Columbus as a slave trader instead of an explorer
You gotta admit they did get massacred the Indians
We gave them a bunch a shit to make up for that
Land reservations And now they got the casinos
What the fuck we ever get we didn't have to work for?
I wouldn't mind sitting all day smoking mushrooms
and collecting government checks
You know what it is? I'll tell you what it is
It's anti-ltalian discrimination
Columbus Day is a day of Italian pride
It's our holiday and they wanna take it away
Fuck them
But I never liked Columbus
In Napoli a lot of people are not so happy for Columbus
cause he was from Genova
What's the problem with Genova?
The North of Italy always have the money and the power
They punish the South since hundreds of years
Even today they put up their nose at us
like we're peasants
I hate the North
Jesus take it easy
I'm gonna take action here
Ro gonna go to the church luncheon tomorrow?
It's on the subject of Italian-American women and pride
I guess 'cause of Columbus Day
Who's the star?
A woman professor from Montclair State
Father Phil says she's very good
You should come Adriana
Me?
Yeah come with us
Noon in the bingo room at Saint Peter and Paul's

Furio Giunta just bought himself a little house in Nutley

Never mind Let it die a death
What joke?
You're better off not hearing it
Trust me
Fuck that! I demand you tell me Paulie!
John you got more laborers on that job site than we got carpenters
What's the problem?
The carpenters are carrying sheetrock and materials
We ain't getting what we expected to get
Minimally expected
Let Massarone hire more laborers off the books
Nobody's talking to you!
All right Jesus
65:35
Johnny you explain the other thing I want to talk about
Sure Tony we've discovered you bought property
You did it with inside knowledge from Ron Zellman
Got your attention from where?
That property's hot because of the Esplanade
We share the Esplanade We share Zellman
If the Soprano family's gonna benefit from a thing
Carmine feels we should too
Okay we'll work something out
I've been your doctor for 30 years you still hate the thermometer
Tony Furio's here!
Thank you for bringing those strufoli I love those
Here's a few long-term bonds that I find attractive
Wouldn't it be great if the person you trust most was your broker?
Let's look at your allocations At Schwab we give advice
that's not driven by commission
Call 1-800-7-SCHWAB to set up a consultation
to check the health of your portfolio
And lay off the junk bonds
I got pictures of my new house
Let me see
Welcome back We're here today with our guests Dr Del Redclay
who's a professor of anthropology at Rutgers University...
and spokesman for the anti-Columbus protest
My God
And also Mr Phillip L Di Notti...
It's lovely
...a coalition of Italian-American anti-defamation organizations
Okay
This thing gets on my nerves
Don't get me started
Well let's start with the idea of a parade for a genocidal colonial general
A national holiday no less
Such festivities are deeply offensive to us
These are pretty broad charges
All I know
is Italian Americans are extremely proud of Christopher Columbus...
admiral of the ocean seas and a great Italian
You know very well of the compromised position we put forth
Now if you people wanna make it an Italian pride parade...
we have no problem with that
Western history says Columbus discovered America
The same America that put your people in bondage for three centuries
But every culture has had to bear the pain...
in the making of what I think we can all agree
is a startling economic miracle
We cured polio
I have to agree with Phil
The right to vote
Exactly
Take my grandparents Two simple people from Sicily...
who braved the perilous middle passage...
Middle passage? That's the term for the slave trade
Montel the Italian people in this country also have suffered discrimination
Earth to Phil
We're talking 300 years of slavery here
Enough
You okay Tony? You look a little muscia-moosh
Uncle Jun's trial starts today
First Soprano family trial in 16 years
We should go
The guys are gonna be at the other place
Thank you for the cookies
And congratulations on that house
And I like the kitchen
Take a strufoli
Be seated
Next case on the calendar...
United States of America versus Corrado John Soprano et al
Any applications before I bring in the jury?
No your honor Bring the jury
Telephone charges on your last bill?
Cost me $40 every time you pick up the phone
I can't...
$2.380 last month alone
I'm going to give you some preliminary instructions...
and explain the process by which we will try this case
The first order of business...
Looking out at this audience of proud strong beautiful women...
how far we have come in this American journey
Look how we've both preserved the tradition of our ancestors...
and managed to become new Italian-American women
Such flair we have added to our image
And yet America still sees us...
as pizza makers and Mama Leones
It is your job ladies to spread the word
Our grandmothers may have been dressed in black...
but we're in Moschino and Armani
For those who say Italian Americans eat smelly cheese
and sip cold wine...
tell them we're from the land of aromatic Asiago
and supple Barolo
If they say "Spaghetti and meatballs..."
you tell them "Orecchiette with broccoli rabe "
If they say "John Gotti "
you tell them "Rudolph Giuliani "
A Princeton study showed that 74 percent...
of Americans associated Italian Americans with organized crime
Why would they do this?
Because of the way the media depict us
Again it is our job to make sure people know...
the other side of Italian-American culture
The educated wage-earning law-abiding side
Because isn't that who we truly are?
Thank you
Thank you Professor Murphy...
or should I call you Professor Longo-Murphy?
Longo as you don't call me late for dinner
Small point: Didn't I read about
a more recent study at Fairleigh Dickinson that found the opposite was true?
That the great majority of Americans recognize these are fictional portrayals?
We're still looking at the sample selection criteria used in that study
Well thanks for an excellent talk
And thank you all for attending today
Don't miss Professor Murphy's new book:
Strega ' The Sorceress as Imago Figure in Italian Literature
And stick around for coffee and dessert
courtesy of Cocuzzo's pastry shop
I'll say it that was totally uncalled for
Father Intintola's forgetting his friends
It was outrageous I'm shocked
Everyone's entitled to their opinion
Really though how dare he? After all you've done for this parish
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna cut him a new one
Father I don't know what to say I'm so upset
Why what's wrong?
What's wrong?
Carmela is one of your biggest supporters and friends
How dare you let her suffer humiliation and embarrassment...
at the hands of an outsider?
What do you mean?
You know exactly what I mean
Unfortunately because of her husband's high profile in the waste industry...
she's the one who bears the brunt of insults
But there were many of us who were equally offended
I am sorry
This is an open forum
You did hear me bring up that new study
If that's your idea of a good luncheon speaker...
I suggest you think about who really keeps...
this parish alive year after year
The size of your cities pain the eyes of the red man
A man in your cities is numb to the stench...
Go back to your reservation!
Mussolini was Hitler's bitch!
Go back!
In the words of Chief Seattle '
"For the last Red Man shall have perished...
"and the memory of my tribe...
"shall have become a myth among the White Men..."
Take your tom-toms and get out of here! You son of a bitch!
..."these shores these woods
the highway will swarm with the invisible dead of our people!
The White Man will never be alone!"
This is Newark baby we don't play that shit!
And that better not be Columbus!
Take it down
He's going to burn...
the way our ancestors did!
Go sit down cupcake!
We're not taking anything down!
We're gonna fucking hang you up there!
Break it up!
Let's break it up!
We will make arrests!
What the fuck is this Joey?
They got a permit Sil
Everybody come on let's go!
Everybody!
I'll remember this Joey
Come on
Come on You too
Let me go
All right we gotta go
Shit
Down with globalization!
What are you doing? This is a peaceful demonstration here
Everybody get over here!
Get him out of here
Orecchiette and broccoli rabe The truth is that is Northern
Armani too And Michelangelo
What a coward that man is He's always been a lily-liver
He's sweet
What did he say?
He's all apologetic now I let him have it
You did what you could
I couldn't leave here without saying something
I gotta go I'm getting my new crown today
All right
bye
Karen bring Bobby and the kids over for a cookout on Saturday
Hello?
It's me Dad
What's up Bobby?
Mom tried to call you
She wants you to pick up some steaks and eggplants before you come home
She can't do it?
I'm stuck in traffic now I gotta go to the store?
She had to go get some crowns or something
Your mother's a real pain in the you-know-what sometimes
When she gets home tell her I said "Thanks a lot "
If you can't find the recipe I'll ask Angie
It's around here somewhere
Hello
Hi Gab
What? When?
Oh my God!
No!
God that's terrible
Yeah okay
What happened?
Karen had an accident on Pompton Avenue
She's dead
I get home for dinner last night Gabby's sitting there devastated
I just saw Karen at ShopRite last week
You talking about Karen?
Great kid
This happened to this doctor I know Oriental ran right into him
What's Bobby gonna do? He adored that woman
What are you doing getting arrested when this family's on trial?
I'm sorry...
You went down there too
No
It was my idea
What the fuck?
We got little Paulie in St Barnabas Plus we lost face there
This is something that hits home I can't turn the other cheek on this
I know but we're running a business here
Don't you all got something to do?
What's with you? I count on you to be the most level-headed guy I got
My father was a Knight of Columbus
I'm Italian American and I pay money...
to the Italian Anti-Defamation Coordination Council and basta
We're the victims here
You write a check too?
Let's not forget
It was a friend of ours Joe Columbo...
who founded the first Italian-American anti-defamation organization
You were still out of line
You're right
A hundred percent
But?
Well as your consigliere
since you ask...
I think the guys and myself too we need your leadership on this
All right
good I understand you wanna do something but use your brain
Believe me me and Ralphie are working on a few things
This battle's gonna be won on the PR level
Hearts and minds
They manipulate your image Columbus...
you manipulate theirs
All right
Who's calling please?
Good morning Assemblyman
What's up?
You know this protest with the Indians and Columbus Day?
I heard about it
We need somebody to make it go away
Boy that's a tough one Real hot potato
Nobody wants to touch it
We just want a peaceful parade like always
with no interference What's wrong with that?
It's the First Amendment and it's Native Americans
Very sensitive stuff
My hands are tied on this one
Sorry
Yeah fine -I will be attending the parade as always
You got my support there
I wish that I could...
The last time that you dated a friend and colleague...
of your brother's he left you flat
disappeared into the witness protection program
I know
Now another man...
who works with your brother...
unable to meet your basic needs for love and respect...
involved with another woman
Which brings me back to my childhood
And my mother
and my father
Now we're talking
Where I had no love and no support
And where I was shamed and ridiculed for being artistic
In your relationship with these men...
you have replaced your father with your brother...
as a figure of authority that you need to prove something to
You set up these scenarios with these men...
similar to your father and your brother seeking your brother...
i e...your father's acceptance
The hell with them
I know
The work is to make new choices...
that have nothing to do with old patterns
I want to Sandy I do
God give me the strength
She will
Your Star-Ledger interview conflicts with Eye on New Jersey
Del Redclay right? I knew it
Yeah I saw you on Channel 20 Don't get up
I'm Henry Caruso Pleased to meet you
Now this lovely lady...
Maggie Donner I'm Del's TA
Yes I can see that
Well I might as well get to the point
I represent a group of concerned citizens who are...
very upset about this protest you're spearheading
no puns intended
Who do you represent?
Italians
Here in New Jersey
Good people
Family people
And they've asked me to tell you that...
it's not in your best interest to go through with this
If you've come here to intimidate me you don't know much about Indian resolve
Should I call security?
You remember this guy?
Iron Eyes Cody he was an actor
Son of Paleface Sitting Bull
Your fucking poster boy
Part Cherokee part Cree
He wasn't even a fucking Indian
Second generation Sicilian
from Louisiana named Espera DeCorti
I think you better leave now
The guy's a total fucking phony
A total fugace
Even Jay Silverheels knew it
But he kept it quiet
We're not gonna
You keep up your bullshit
we're gonna go wide with this thing
Knock yourself out
Jesus Christ is this true?
This is a fucking disaster!
Chill out You didn't know about this?
It's been on Access Hollywood E!...
This is a major PR boner
It's been researched Cody was definitely
Native American Total environmentalist
Are you sure about this?
Look I'm one-eighth Italian myself
You are? You never told me that
My great-great something or other was a pony soldier
Well actually he was a violinist attached to the Seventh Cavalry
That is just one person's opinion Anthony
What football again?
He's not gonna get hurt he's a tough kid
Jesus
We're having a discussion about Christopher Columbus
"They would make fine servants
"With 50 men we could subgate them..."
Subjugate
..."and make them do whatever we want "
That doesn't sound like a slave trader to you?
George Washington had slaves
the father of our country
Well what's your point?
His history teacher Mr Cushman is teaching your son...
that if Columbus was alive today
he'd go on trial for crimes against humanity like Milosevic in you know Europe
Your teacher said that? It's not just my teacher it's the truth
It's in my history book
So you finally read a book and it's bullshit
You had to walk in Columbus' shoes to see what he went through
People thought the world was flat for crying out loud
Then he lands on an island with a bunch
of naked savages on it That took a lot of guts
You remember when we went to Florida the heat and those bugs?
Like it took guts to murder people and put them in chains
He was a victim of his time
Who cares? It's what he did
He discovered America is what he did
He was a brave Italian explorer
And in this house Christopher Columbus is a hero End of story
I should've known
I should've known you needed me
I should've been with you
I should've been in your place
My love
my sweet love
How he loved her
You know what I heard one time?
Sil was on the phone He was talking with somebody...
about how Bobby was the only one of them who doesn't have a cumare
They were laughing at him
Who was he talking to on the phone?
I don't know
I'll go first this time I'll bring my eggplant parm over to Bobby's
Actually tomorrow is better for me
Ginny hi We were just talking about who's gonna do what when
I played canasta with her just last week
There he is John look...
I'm sorry I missed Allegra's nursing school graduation
Unforgivable
But I made it up to her
Stick it in your ass
Hey Count Chocula...
What the fuck John?
Keep him away from me
John what's going on?
I don't wanna talk about it
What's this?
I have no fucking idea
But I got better shit to do
You saw how it was with them at dinner the other night?
Something's going on
Plus out of nowhere Carmine's up
my ass on this Frelinghuysen Avenue bullshit
Somebody's talking too much
And it's costing me money
Come on
There's no release
I'm surrounded by death My husband my son my friend
I don't know what to tell you Ro There's pieces torn out of me
chunks of me that are dead
Look at me My youth my looks they're gone
No
That's from not taking care of yourself
Dwelling on all this stuff
It's not "stuff "
Do you have any idea what it feels like?
Do you?
It's not "stuff " It's death it's pain!
I'm having a lot of trouble dealing with this
I don't know
You don't know what?
I don't think I can do this
I don't think I can help you
You need a lot right now I don't think there's anything I can do
You can be there for me you could comfort me
What about me?
What do I get out of it?
There it is Right there
What do you get?
How about your every need taken care of? Sexually everything!
All your shit It's all about you isn't it?
It's not all about me but I mean...
let's be realistic
"Let's be realistic"?
What you wanna leave me?
Yeah
Then get the fuck out
It doesn't have to be like this How should it be?
How the fuck should it be?
Somehow Carmine found out we were flipping properties on Frelinghuysen Avenue
so your take's a little less than we talked about
He makes an issue out of Zellman?
What's this one called Hesh?
This is Pie-O-My
Just broke her maiden at Belmont last month A lot of speed
I'm buying her
Cool man
She's beautiful
That's right
Don't you know somebody over there at Deerpark Casino in Connecticut?
Run by the Mohonk tribe?
Yeah Marty My niece's husband
This Columbus Day protest we need somebody to make it go away
What's wrong with freedom of speech?
Listen to my kid talking about Columbus Calls him a murdering thief
They wiped out almost all of my people
Cubans are from Spain
They were Taino Indians who got raped by Columbus and the Conquistadors
That's right Reuben
Mulignon got Martin Luther King Day what do we got?
I have sympathy for the red man
Why is that?
Jews because of their history have common cause with the oppressed
Some Indians were deliberately given blankets tainted with smallpox
Died like flies
No shit?
Yeah shit
Yeah? You wanna talk about terrorism? Look who started it
Amen to that my friend
That's right
Christopher Columbus was no better than Adolf Hitler
Back up Hitler?
Yeah I'm not the only one who thinks so
That Indian from the protest
who was whining about the wilderness?
They had him on T V...and he called Columbus Hitler
'Cause it's true man
You're talking out of your ass
Columbus and Hitler? You're trivializing the Holocaust
Frankly Reuben if you got that kind of covert anti-Semitism...
I'd like you to leave my house
Anti-Semitism?
That's right
Fuck you too my man!
Guys come on Reuben Hesh you guys been friends for years
I'll call Marty up in Connecticut He knows a big Mohonk
That cocksucker
We're not tired I didn't spill food 'cause I'm tired
Don't argue okay? Listen to your Aunt Grace and Aunt Mary
Do what they say
All right say good night to your Aunt Carmela
Good night Aunt Carmela
It's great your family could come down
They're leaving tomorrow
Somebody's sick up there
Dad?
Dad Sophia locked the door!
Should I get that?
He takes all my pencils!
Baccilieri residence
Carmela is that you?
It's Corrado
Hello
How's my boy Bobby doing? He knows I couldn't make it to the services
He's all right he's upstairs with the kids
What a heartbreak
You know I remember the first time I met her like it was yesterday
It was my birthday dinner at Roman Gardens I'll never forget it
She said I looked like Pablo Picasso
And I didn't even know what he looked like
But one day she showed me a picture of him and you know she was right
That's very touching Let me get Bobby
I wanna know if he'll pick me up for court or if I should call Murf
Maybe you should let Bobby be Think about his needs instead of your own
It's not me Don't villainize me here
Murf goes to bed early so I wanted to call him now if I need him to drive me
I don't wanna disturb him when he's asleep He's an old man for God's sake
Stella!
What the fuck are you doing?
We don't have to hide baby
I did it
Now I can devote myself to you completely
Now there can be no more fear
No more guilt
Just sex
Yeah
You know what I want
And you want it all don't you?
Oh yeah You need me slut
I need it all baby!
Oh shit!
Tonight's my night I gotta bring food over to Bobby Bacala's
You're on ziti patrol too?
Ro's got Thursdays
Well what should I do?
You could do me a solid Tony
Next time you see Hesh...
remind him my granddaughter's Bat Mitzvah present doesn't really work
The bubble jet printer I don't like to keep hocking him
He knows about it
He said he lost the sales slip
So Marty where is this guy?
There he is What'd I say? Right on cue
Chief
Where behind the preppy guy?
That's him
Chief I'd like to introduce you to my friends
Silvio Dante Tony Soprano
The guy I was telling you about
Chief Doug Smith
Tribal chairman of the Mohonk Indians and CEO of Mohonk Enterprises
An honor
Thanks for coming all the way down here
I had business in Manhattan anyway
Not again
Would you bring the gentleman a Ketel One please?
So Chief he told you about the shit going down in Newark?
Small element Ruins it for the rest of us
I've got a $250 million casino and a huge Italian-American customer base
Providence east Boston Good people
Our part of the world We're closer than Atlantic City
This is a brand new facility state-of-the-art
This fucking protest They're burning Columbus in effigy down there
They'll lay down in front of the parade
That's not gonna happen
People like Redclay they're out of touch in their ivory towers
They don't understand the economic opportunity
that funds much of the Native American community
this man put in the Deerpark reservation rec center
You should see the Olympic-size swimming pool...
Well we all got kids
We don't want to see our heritage attacked that's all
No offense Chief but you don't look much like an Indian
Frankly I passed most of my life as white...
until I had a racial awakening and discovered my Mohonk blood
My grandmother on my father's side her mother was a quarter Mohonk
All this happened when the casino bill got passed right?
Better late than never
Mohonk if you love Columbus
Sorry I didn't make it last night
My Bible group had a potluck for the homeless
and I was on cleanup crew
Food food Like that solves all the world's problems
Bobby we've been neighbors
I know that we don't talk much but if you want to I'm here for you
What is it?
That day...
when she had the accident...
I was stuck in traffic
And my son called because Karen wanted me to pick up steaks and eggplants
And I was mad at her for sending me
I was tired
I was mad at her
But I was stuck in traffic because of her accident
She was up the road ahead of me lying in twisted metal
But I didn't know and I could've been with her
I should've been there to help her
But I was mad at her
My sweet Karen
My sweet girl
Pass me the peppers
Hello
Yeah Just a second
Ton' it's the Indian Chief
Doug how are you?
Tony I wish I had better news
I struck out Redclay didn't go for it
Tony I wish I had better news I struck out Redclay didn't go for it
Ask him about the Iron Eyes Cody thing
I felt unworthy to even be in his presence
I was so moved by him
And then I look at Ralphie
You saw in this man the things that you want in your life
Love
Yes
Somehow I have to find a way to move away
from the darkness and toward the light
What does this man do?
He works with my brother but he's not like the others
Janice... -Sandy he's different Believe me
But back to Ralph
You've got to sit him down and level with him
Speak the truth Jan...
but with the compassion and respect that you're famous for And say goodbye...
for his sake as well as yours
You're right
It's not his fault
Roll me some numbers fearless leader
Coming at you
Yeah I'm ready six
It's all right
You had a great run T
You held the dice for quite a while
Look at this operation
Whenever I'm in one of these places I remember that
my grandmother was part Fugawe
Maybe I should do something about it
Bullshit
No it's true
She was They were a nomadic tribe they'd wander around
get lost and they go "Where the Fugawe?"
I see you gentlemen are having a good time You getting enough to eat?
Yeah
Running out of my comps here
Go find Marty He's on the floor somewhere
Tony can we talk a minute? Buy you a drink?
Yeah sure
I wanted to give you a check for Jason's tuition
Okay
The statement's up in my bedroom
That's okay I trust you
Wait is it 5:00?
John I'm here at Christopher Columbus Park in Newark...
where this afternoon violence broke out briefly...
between Native American demonstrators and members of a coalition...
of 18 various Italian-American pride organizations
Get out of here! This is our day! You hear that?
He fed our people to his dogs!
My God this is tragic
Could be scored with Albinoni's Adagio
Janootski!
This is it hon This is the last of the stuff I had at Ro's
Your shoes
What?
Didn't I ask you to take your shoes off when you came in this house?
Forgot
Sorry hon
You forgot
So that's just it You fucking forgot!
Oh fuck
Get out!
My back
I'll kill you you crazy bitch
I'll kill you you bitch You crazy cunt!
Get out!
It's gotta be on here somewhere
scuffle at the Columbus Day parade in Newark
Among those arrested for blocking a fire lane...
was Native American activist Del Redclay...
who called the protest an unqualified success
Elsewhere a blind river rafter is going to get her wish...
after suing for a place in the Colorado River...
I should've been there
I would've been fucking there I forgot this was a Monday
Maybe we ought to just whack this prick
Who the fuck are you kidding?
All you thought about was blackjack
What?
You think this day in the country was free don't you?
Well it wasn't
Fucking Chief Smith wants Frankie Valli to come up there and play a week
That's what this whole fucking junket was about
Frankie?
Yeah that's right
That's why he buttonholed me goddamn it
There's bad blood with Frankie's manager
So the Chief wants me to call him as payback for him reaching out to Redclay
Well you're gonna make the fucking call -I ain't seen Frankie for years... -
Tough shit! You're making the fucking call!
You and this fucking parade already
I don't know what you're so hot about
They discriminate against all Italians as a group when they disallow Columbus...
Will you fucking stop?
"Group"!
What the fuck happened to Gary Cooper? That's what I'd like to know
He died
You mean 'cause he fought the Sioux in all those westerns?
Fuck that
Gary Cooper Now there was an American
The strong silent type He did what he had to do
He faced down the Miller gang
when none of those other assholes would lift a finger to help him
And did he complain? Did he say
"I come from this poor Texas-lrish
"illiterate background or whatever so leave me the fuck out of it...
"because my people got fucked over"? T not for nothing...
but you're getting a little confused here
A: That was the movies
What difference does that make?
Columbus was so long ago he might as well have been a fucking movie
Images you said
The point is Gary Cooper...
the real Gary Cooper...
or anybody named Cooper never suffered like the Italians
A madigan like him they fucked everybody else
The Italians the Polacks the Blacks
All right even if he was a madigan around nowadays...
he'd be a member of some victims' group
The fundamentalist Christians the abused cowboys the gays whatever
He was gay Gary Cooper?
No! Are you listening to me?
Hey people suffered
Did you? Except for maybe the feds
My grandparents got spit on because they were from Calabria
Let me ask you a question All the good things you got in your life...
did they come to you 'cause you're Calabrese?
I'll tell you the answer The answer is no
You got a smart kid at Lackawanna College
You got a wife who's a piece of ass At least she was when you married her
You own one of the most profitable topless bars in North Jersey
Did you get all this 'cause you're Italian?
No you got it 'cause you're you 'cause you're smart 'cause you're whatever
Where the fuck is our self-esteem?
That shit doesn't come from Columbus or The Godfather or Chef fucking Boyardee
We gotta tiptoe around the Indians though don't we?
We can't call our teams the Braves or the Tomahawks or the...
