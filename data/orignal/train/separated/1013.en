Why would Neal run with three months left on a four-year sentence?
Well,that's what we're wondering.
We're not gonna catch caffrey using roadblocks and... wanted posters.
Kate says "adios" to you at prison
and gets busy with her disappearing act.
Missed her by two days.
You can get me out of here.
There's case law.
I can be released into your custody.
GPS tracking anklet.
The new ones are tamper-proof, never been skipped on.
Let me see it.
The forgeries you caught me on, I signed them.
Where?
Look at the bank seal under polarized light sometime.
Apparently, if a tree falls in a forest, it does make a sound.
I may lose her again, Moz.
Lose her? I just found her.
So did he.
Kate! Kate!
So you know who has Kate?
I don't have a name, but I know this -- he's FBI.
So, the guy who has Kate is in the FBI?
Apparently.
This confirms everything.
Moz, take it easy.
If you lay down with dogs, you get up with fleas.
I could live without the fortune-cookie commentary.
Now you understand my fear of "the man."
You're back with us, my friend.
The fearful masses -- welcome back.
Suspects?
How many field offices does the FBI have?
56 -- not including resident agencies.
Then I have a lot of suspects.
So how do we draw them out?
We don't. It's his move.
Morning, Peter.
Where are you?
Well, within my two-mile radius. Where are you?
I'm at my dining-room table.
Listen. We've got a suspected jewelry heist.
I'm intrigued.
Meet me at 14th and 9th in 30.
That's La Joyau Precieux.
I'm even more intrigued.
The most expensive clothing boutique in the city.
Of course you'd know it.
You're gonna love this.
So, what do I do?
Nothing.
How about you?
I suffer through another day of work.
And eat breakfast alone.
So, what happened at Le Joyau?
Don't know yet.
They called this morning and were a little light on the details.
They may or may not have been robbed.
So, they called the FBI, not the police?
Must be my dazzling reputation.
I don't know what could be so valuable at a clothing store.
Well, hopefully, it has nothing to do with the promotion.
What promotion?
They're displaying the world's most exotic pink diamond.
That might have something to do with it.
Well, this is something you don't see every day,
Except maybe if you're you.
Agent Peter Burke.
It's like Buckingham Palace.
No, I've been to Buckingham Palace.
This is better.
Agent Burke?
Yeah.
This is a delicate situation.
I'd appreciate if we could keep this discreet?
Keep what discreet?
You were a little vague on your telephone call.
You're aware of this promotion?
A display of the most exotic pink diamond in the world.
42-karat "Steinmetz Pink" set in platinum.
It may have been stolen.
You're worried it's a forgery?
Yes.
What makes you think it's a fake?
Follow me, please.
When I arrived this morning, everything was as it should be.
We removed the necklace from the vault,
opened the show as planned.
Later, when we were doing our mandatory review
of last night's security tapes, we saw this.
Saw what?
That's your vault?
Yes.
The necklace was stored there for 10 hours between
its arrival last night and the opening of the show this morning.
That's your first clue?
Why is the necklace still on the model?
It's opening day. This is the promotional event of the year.
I don't care what it is.
You've got a masked man entering your vault.
I'm shutting you down.
Let's go, folks! The store is closed!
There's nothing to see here.
What's going on?
You just became a very beautiful crime scene.
Lauren, have all the models wait over there.
Nobody leaves.
Okay.
We're not positive it's a counterfeit.
Our appraiser is still on a plane.
If it turns out to be a mistake,
the amount of money we would lose,
not to mention our credibility, would be...
I've got my own appraiser.
Hello again. Just...
Is it fake?
He's talking about the necklace, right?
It's beautiful work.
Thank you.
Guess that answers that question.
I need a closer look.
Just take it off her.
I'm trying to preserve the crime scene.
It's preserved.
Thank you.
Yep.
It's synthetic.
There's no such thing as a synthetic pink of that size.
It simply doesn't exist.
Yes, pink is difficult to match.
It's only achievable using irradiation,
which creates an extremely fine occlusion within the stone
that's virtually impossible to detect unless you're looking for it.
I don't know how this could have happened.
No one knew when the necklace was to arrive
or where it was supposed to be stored.
All right, you two,
I'm gonna need alibis from everyone who worked here
and anybody who knew the diamonds were in the vault.
What about our boy with the mask?
Do you have surveillance on how he got in?
Our security cameras only record
what happens on the floor and in the vault itself.
We don't record the hallways.
We have a back door, but the alarm was never triggered.
He must have tampered with the system.
Do you think he hacked the alarm?
Hacked the alarm?
Oh, yeah, it's possible,
if you could find the camera's blind spots and sneak past.
Is that what you'd do?
It's one option.
All right, I'm gonna confiscate your surveillance video, the necklace...
And we will need you for further questioning.
What's it like to be a model?
I bet it's fun. Right?
You're, like, walking around catwalks...
Caffrey.
It's legit.
E.R.T. is going over the alarm system.
This guy's a pro.
Think they'll find any prints?
No.
You okay?
Who is that?
I don't know,but hughes doesn't look happy.
O.P.R.'s here.
And that explains why.
O.P.R.
"office of professional responsibility."
The police have internal affairs.
We have O.P.R.
Hughes wants you in the office.
Of course he does.
Agent burke,this is Garrett Fowler.
O.P.R.
Bad news travels fast.
Yes,it does.
As far as anyone knows, he is here for a standard review.
Yeah, because that line always works.
Nobody's gonna buy that bridge today.
That's my file.
Yes,it is.
Impressive work.
I wanted to talk to you about the case
that you're currently investigating.
The jewelry heist? Why?
Well, the only people that knew that
Diamond was gonna be placed in the vault
The night before the show were a few key
N.Y.P.D brass and a handful of FBI agents.
You think it's an inside job.
And you already have a suspect,don't you?
You know where neal caffrey was last night?
Am I being interrogated here?
You're not.
Look,this whole thing is a waste of time.
Caffrey didn't do it.
He wears an electronic monitoring anklet.
It records everywhere he goes.
Just pull it up.
Yeah, we did that.
And?
And some of the data from caffrey's
Anklet is missing for last night.
Missing.
Went dark for six hours.
Well, that's impossible.
That anklet can't be tampered with.
No, it can't, but... evidently the database
Where the information is stored can be.
Someone wiped out six hours of tracking data.
Then I suggest that you lurk around the U.S.Marshals office,
Because they're the people who monitor that anklet.
Caffrey belongs to the bureau.
That makes him our problem.
Any leads?
This is a short list of suspects
Capable of pulling this off.
The best ones are already incarcerated.
This guy is dead.
Okay. List just got shorter.
Adrian Tulane.
This is our prime suspect?
Yeah, it's a top-notch forgery.
Not many people are capable of this kind of work.
What about you?
If I were legally allowed within 50
feet of the right equipment, maybe.
Tulane's smart... and a showman.
Cameras don't scare him, and he has
The facilities to pull this off.
It's got his signature all over it.
All right.
Let's talk to him.
What is with you?
You're like a kid on a sugar high.
You don't understand. Tulane is a legend.
Legend? No, don't oversell him.
It's like you meeting
Eilot Ness.
Eliot N--
Doing a puzzle with your girlfriend, huh?
That's a nice, wholesome family activity.
How can I help you,agent...?
Burke. FBI.
You're Tulane?
You know I am.
Yeah. I do.
I want to ask you a few questions.
Are you familiar with
The diamond necklace that was stolen from Joyau Precieux?
Yeah. That.
Whenever something like this happens
I get a visit from someone like you.
That's why I try to be prepared.
You'll find plane tickets confirming I
Arrived in the country this morning.
Oh, and you're gonna love the photos
From my trip to madrid last week.
Anything else?
What's that supposed to be? A cloud?
No.
I'll be in touch.
Stop grinning.
What? The guy is slick.
Let's hope he's guilty, too.
I'm just curious.
The, uh, the Uffizi job.
Did you...?
Right. Right, right, right.
I love your alleged work.
Big fan.
Ugh, that was a bastard.
Why are you disappointed? This is the part you like.
Moving the pieces. Solving the puzzle.
I am moving the pieces.
What were you doing the night of the heist?
Went over some case files.
That's it?
Didn't hang out with anybody?
June? The short guy?
I don't have an alibi.
Look, I get it.
Inside job, diamond forgery, O.P.R.'s in town.
I'm sure I'm at the top of the list.
I am the list, aren't I?
Did you do it?
Come on, man.
Did you do it?
I didn't do it.
I'm telling you the truth, Peter.
Hey, looking for me?
Yeah, I need you looking this.
It's forged bonds. Some of caffrey's old work.
I need you to look at them under a
Polarized light... for a signature.
What? Neal's signature?
Yeah,when I arrested caffrey the second time
He told me he signed the bonds.
I want to know if that's true or if he's bragging.
Okay.
Is this, uh, related to our fake diamonds?
Let's hope it's not.
I appreciate the irony.
We're looking into them, and they're looking into you.
Tell me what you got.
Okay. I checked into Peter's boss -- Hughes.
This guy's a legend.
Been with the FBI for 25 years.
They were forced to make him retire
But they found a loophole and brought him back.
Skeletons?
Nada.
And I checked, uh, that agent
Ruiz, who handles organized crime.
Uh, lots of skeletons there, but I
Don't think he's smart enough.
No.
I checked, uh, Jones.
Did you know his first name is Clinton?
Checked into, uh, Lauren.
You checked Lauren?
You said, "check everybody."
Then there's this guy from O.P.R. Fowler.
What about him?
Used to work violent crimes for the bureau.
Wife was killed during a robbery, and he took a year leave.
Then he joined O.P.R, and his files were sealed.
Sealed?
Interesting.
He showed up awfully fast after this went down.
Have a ring?
No. No ring.
Tan line?
No.
But that doesn't mean it's not him.
I hope not.
O.P.R. Is like this giant, sucking black hole
Accountable only to the D.O.J.
Department of justice?
Well, D.O.J. Is just a euphemism, of
Course, for the military industrial complex.
And big oil, right?
Goes without saying.
Um, by the way, that necklace...
Yeah.
Did you...
I didn't take it.
Because if you need a fence...
Moz. Moz.
Okay, okay. Got it. I get it.
If we can't figure out how he stole it, we can
Try to grab him when he goes to fence it.
It's a unique piece. It's too hot for the market right now.
Brunei is an interesting angle
'Cause the market there is less rigid...
Yeah, the language barrier can be a challenge, Though,
'Cause one time...
Neal caffrey?
You're under arrest.
What?
We found the signature "NC"
Microprinted on the fake diamond.
It matches the signature we found on the counterfeit bonds he made.
See? It's good work, agent Burke.
Let's go.
Stop.
He's my responsibility.
Peter...
Neal... You have the right to remain silent.
I didn't do this.
Remain silent.
Please.
All right. Let's go.
You let me down, Neal.
I let you down?
You told Fowler to look for my initials.
And you told me to look at your bonds under a polarized light,remember?
Well, guess what. I did.
And,yeah, you signed 'em.
And you think I'd be stupid enough to do that again?
I guess you were.
The thief is associated with a law enforcement,
Your anklet was tampered with,
你的You have no alibi, and your initials are on the diamond.
What am I supposed to think?!
I was set up.
By who?
I'm working on that.
You're not helping things.
Agent Burke.
What?
His lawyer's here.
He's a lawyer?
You can check my university of Phoenix online degree.
Go,cardinals.
Now,if you don't mind,I'd like to speak to my client...
Alone.
I didn't let you down.
All right. Any problems?
None. This was genius.
I don't know why we didn't think of this earlier.
And here the man is now.
Agent Burke.
Yeah.
That was an excellent job yesterday.
Appreciate the cooperation.
You know, Caffrey was a great asset.
He did good work for us.
That may be, but don't forget, he's a criminal.
Good job.
Guys,I want to pull out the paperwork on,uh,2b.
We have a problem.
Caffrey's lawyer just requested every file the bureau has on him.
The judge ordered us to comply.
The judge actually raised his voice to the prosecutor.
"Open discovery.
Turn over every document the government has on Caffrey."
They're sending a truck.
All right. Did you follow Fowler?
Yep. Once the request went through,
He made a pit stop at a local dumpster.
He shredded these.
I knew it. Thank you, Moz. This is perfect.
Uh, information on the judge.
Wait.
He's got a private office not connected to the federal building...
On Mott street.
Moz,I need you to liquidate some assets.
I need money.
Why?
I want you to buy a bakery.
So,all the Tulane information checks out. He's eerily clean.
Of course he is. What's Neal's lawyer been up to?
Not much. Legally we can't follow him.
Attorney-client privilege.
Yeah,yeah.
So we have no idea what he's doing.
Well,we do know he made a large real-estate purchase in Neal's name.
What?
He bought a bakery?
That's what it looks like.
Why'd he buy a bakery?
We don't know. We don't even know where the damn thing is located.
All we have is a lease with a redacted address.
Attorney-client privileges.
Yeah, covers a lot of sins, that one.
A bakery.
Bakery?
Done.
Construction.
Finished.
How's the air-conditioning in the judge's office?
Hmm, broke down this morning.
All right.
Let's go to court.
Hey,you.
You got my message.
I did. Thank you.
I wanted you to have a familiar face here.
Well, I'll take yours anytime.
So, uh, are you sure Neal did this?
Yeah. I am.
Of course, he says he was framed.
Maybe he was.
Ah, I wish it was true.
What's up?
So,the arraignment's been moved.
Why?
Neal said he's gonna confess.
So I guess you were right.
Neal never confesses.
Yeah, he said some important people were gonna be named,
And he won't do it in an open court,
So they moved the proceedings.
Where?
Judge's chambers around the corner.
Honey, I'll call you later, okay?
Uh, get ahold of Hughes.
Bailiff, would you open a window?
Oh, the heat is stifling in here.
Unfortunately, the air-conditioning is not working today.
Thank you. Please, wait outside?
Per your request, Mr.Caffrey,
The chambers have been cleared.
Thank you, your honor.
In accordance with that agreement, you are now prepared to give a full confession?
I am, your honor.
I'll admit I've done a lot of things in my life that I'm not proud of.
No. No, that's not true.
I'm proud of most of them.
But what I'm about to do today... This is gonna be good.
Judge Hickman's office.
Fourth floor.
Thank you.
Bakery.
That son of a bitch bought that bakery.
I confess that I did not steal the diamond necklace from La Joyau Precieux.
I cleared these chambers
Because you claimed to have sensitive information vital to this case.
If you didn't steal the diamond, then who did?
I'll let you know.
Bailiff!
Somebody jumped out of a window and ran into a van!
He's not in the van.
Get to the city planner's office.
Find out where these tunnels lead.
Burke!
Caffrey escaped?
Yeah, did a four-story swan dive
Onto that awning of the bakery.
Who approved moving the arraignment?
The marshals guaranteed the security of the room.
Never assume anything with Neal.
You know, I've been working my ass off keeping this kid on the straight and narrow.
He's been helping us win cases -- until you came along.
Oh, don't put this on me!
Hey, hey, gentlemen! Gentlemen!
Hey, let's focus on the problem here.
What do we know? Did we stop the van?
Yeah. The only person in the van was the driver.
He claims he was hired through an anonymous Internet posting.
500 bucks in an envelope to pick up the van and park it at this spot.
Did the van have a floor panel that was removable?
How'd you know?
Caffrey wasn't in there for more than a few seconds.
He's gone underground.
Can we track his anklet?
No, they removed it when we arrested him.
Okay. Burke, find him -- again.
I'm not comfortable with agent Burke running this operation.
I don't care whether you're comfortable or not.
Burke knows Caffrey better than anyone.
Now, get to work.
All right, Burke. What's your plan?
Set up roadblocks,put up wanted posters.
So,to accommodate the location,
We'll have to keep the guest list at about 200.
Yvonne, will you follow up on the caterer?
It should be beautiful, though.
We'll have 10 long tables of 20.
It'll be beautiful.
This is Yvonne.
It's for you.
On your personal phone?
Burke premiere events. This is Elizabeth.
Sorry to bother you at work.
Neal?
Uh, I'll catch up with you guys.
How'd you get this number?
Stupid question.
You know, there's half the law enforcement in North America
Looking for you right now, including my husband.
He'll find me soon enough. I need your help.
Are you okay?
Ah, Still haven't found Neal.
We got a detail outside.
Yeah, I saw.
As if he'd be careless enough to come here.
Where do you think he did go, El?
Is he in the kitchen?
Neal!
Peter.
Of all the places you could run,
You go to my wife.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
You helped him sneak in.
Well, I wouldn't have had to sneak him in
If there weren't those people sitting at our house.
You lied to the FBI.
Honey, I did not lie to the FBI.
There was just a lot of
Milk and cookies and pleasant,
Distracting conversation while Neal slipped around the back.
I love this. You've turned my wife into an accomplice.
Give me one minute to explain.
One minute.
You explain what you were thinking
When you did a free fall from the judge's chambers,
While I decide if I drag you back in chains.
Okay, does that minute start now?
Go.
I told you, I was set up
By someone very close to you.
I couldn't tell you at first
Because I thought it was somebody in the FBI.
Now I'm positive it's Fowler.
Fowler. That's not.
I got 52 seconds left.
I've had a little free time on my hands the past few days.
So, I've been putting these together.
They're documents Fowler shredded
After I requested access to my files.
Morning, Peter.
Where are you?
Within my two-mile radius.
Where are you?
I'm at my dining-room table.
Listen, we've got a suspected jewelry heist.
I'm intrigued.
Meet me at 14th and 9th in 30.
That's Le Joyau Precieux.
I'm even more intrigued.
The most expensive boutique in the city.
Of course you'd know it.
You're gonna love this.
I made that call from my home.
Yep.
My god, they tapped my phone.
No. They didn't tap it. That would require a court order.
Look at your phone.
It's a bug. Standard Bureau issue.
Activates when you pick it up.
They've been inside my house.
They couldn't have had authorization.
Not within the window of the crime and his suspicion of you.
Exactly. Fowler is dirty.
Peter, I have access to every file
The FBI has on me.
You had Jones process a request to
Look at my initials on the bond forgery.
After you checked the forgery to see if I was telling the truth,
One other person checked it, too.
Fowler.
And then my initials just happened to
Show up on the pink diamond.
He's using you to get to me.
My minute's up.
I said I'd give a full confession, so here it is.
I've been trying to find Kate.
Am I supposed to look surprised?
Maybe.
I talked to her, peter.
I'm familiar with this photo.
Well, you haven't seen all of it.
She's being held by someone.
She's too scared to say who.
But after our chinatown operation,
Interpol told me
The man who has Kate is with the FBI.
You think it's Fowler.
I do now.
What's he want from you?
I don't know.
Could be anything.
Like what?
No.
No, you'd have to arrest me.
I should be arresting you right now.
But you're not.
So give him what he wants.
If I do, there's no guarantee I'll ever see her again.
We need to look into Fowler.
You're asking me to investigate O.P.R. That's suicide.
He's already investigating you.
We'd have to go behind the Bureau's back.
Not if you clear me first.
It's what you do for a living, right?
All right.
I'll be in touch.
This is untraceable.
But if for any reason you need to get in touch with me.
Don't say another word.
I don't want to know where you're going.
Plausible deniability?
Words to live by.
Peter...
What's the latest?
We've got conflicting intel.
I mean, we've got reports of Caffrey
Sighted everywhere from Jersey to Geneva.
He's covering all his bases.
Ah, he stole them right off the field.
You got a quick minute?
Yeah.
I just wanted to apologize about the other day, you know?
I mean, we all want what's best for the bureau,right?
Of course.
Hey, and let me ask you a question. Just hypothetically.
If you had to guess, right now... Where's Caffrey?
Probably trying to leave the country... If he hasn't already.
Oh, you don't think he'd stay in Manhattan?
Would there be a reason to?
I don't know.
I just want to make sure we're using
Our resources as wisely as possible, you know?
Like I said, roadblocks and wanted posters.
That's how we're gonna catch him, huh?
It's a good start.
Now, if you don't mind, I got to get back to work.
Oh, yeah.
Do me a favor.
Yeah, what's up?
Keep an eye on this Fowler guy. And his goons.
I'm allowed to do that?
I'm authorizing you to.
Something isn't right.
Hey, my man.
How about you do me a favor?
What's that?
Get the latest photo of Caffrey to Massachusetts P.D.
Something you can't handle yourself?
Oh, I'm just trying to work together.
Right.
Meet me at our jewelry store in 20 minutes.
I didn't think I was supposed to
Return to the scene of the crime.
Let's revisit it and figure out
How you allegedly pulled this all off.
Nice disguise, Jacko.
I never really liked this picture.
Oh, it's pretty good for a mug shot.
It's better than my driver's license photo.
Which one? You have several.
All right. One crime at a time.
I want to check out that vault.
Yeah, well, I can't exactly walk in.
I'm gonna tell them you're in my custody
And that you're gonna show me how you got into the vault.
Stealthy.
Peter, I'm starting to like you again.
Then we're hanging out too much.
We assumed...
The thief went through blind spots of the surveillance camera.
But forensics says the alarm was never tampered with.
Well,that's not possible unless ---
He never left the vault.
This wasn't flickering on the security tape.
No,it wasn't.
Come on.
Nothing.
Could be a misdirect here.
How did the FBI miss this?
We didn't.
Fowler had O.P.R. Take over the investigation.
I'll be -- this is an old prohibition tunnel.
Yeah,well,someone found a new use for it.
I'll call in a team.
We'll start canvassing for witnesses.
We may not have to.
Who said big brother's a bad thing?
Jones.
I'm gonna need you to pull a video off a surveillance camera.
Where's O.P.R.?
I had Jones reassign them to Penn station.
Jones?How'd he do that?
He does a pretty good Fowler.
All right, we're coming up to the place
Where our masked man enters the vault.
Add a few minutes for him to double back and cover his tracks.
Wait wait wait, hold right there.
Is that Tulane?
All right, play it at half-speed.
That's got to be Tulane.
Come on. Come on. Turn around.
Gotcha.
Oh,I guess he never did go to Madrid.
I knew his plane tickets were fakes.
No, you didn't.
Guy steals $3.2 million in diamonds,
And we get him because he can't resist a pretty face.
Well, it happens to the best of us.
What?
You know what.
No,I don't.
Yes,you do.
I see you got my page.
You had no business helping agent Burke disappear like that.
Why would agent Burke disappear?
You think he was being followed?
You want to bring on a full O.P.R.Investigation,agent Jones?
I can internal review every perp you ever slapped a cuff on.
Well, you can start with the one in the conference room.
That's Adrian Tulane.
Agent Burke arrested him this morning
In connection with our jewelry heist.
Guess that clears Caffrey.
How did you know which vault the diamond would be in?
Silence won't help you.
But maybe I can.
Tell me everything,
and I can talk to the prosecutor about immunity.
Why would you give me immunity?
Well,believe it or not,
I don't think you're the brains behind this operation.
Playing on my vanity?
Please,you have some video that proves nothing.
Search warrant helped us find this...
In a townhouse of one of your...puzzle girls.
I think that proves something.
Well,if you're asking for my expertise,
I can tell you that a crime like this
Often has a...benefactor.
The entire operation from delivery route to exit strategy
Is handed to someone.
Tell me something I don't know.
Men with privileged information often hire people
With certain skills to do what they can't.
Of course, all of this is just hypothetical.
This conversation is not hypothetical.
Immunity for a name.
Oh,is he the prosecutor?
Immunity for a name!
I would if I could.
The more I learn,
The more I think this whole case is a setup.
A lot of that seems to be going around.
Make a little room.
Found this stuck on my home phone.
Thought you might have dropped it.
I'm not done with this investigation,Burke.
Neither am I.
I thought that a small celebration would be appropriate.
You really shouldn't drink champagne out of paper.
You will, and you'll like it.
It's twofold,really.
Twofold?
Yeah,you're off the hook.
Mm-hmm,and our jobs are a lot easier
When you run with us,not from us.
Hear, hear.
I'll drink to that.
What about O.P.R.?
They're gone, for now.
Celebrate the victories, however long they last.
I'll drink to that.
Mr.Caffrey? There's a call for you on line 2.
oh,"Mr. Caffrey." call on line 2.
It's probably my lawyer.
You should put him on retainer.
I'll expense it.
Can I use your phone?
"Mr. Caffrey."
Mozzie, I told you, just sign the papers for me.
Neal, it's me.
Kate.
Kate.
He is close to you, Neal
Look, I know who he is.He's with the FBI.
Yes, then just give him what he wants.
What does he want?
Tell me,kate.
Kate. Kate
You can't trust anyone
Hey, I'm just going through these FBI files.
There is a terrifying amount of information here.
How many shots from the knoll?
Let's take a look.
Did Elvis fake his own death?
Ask the mystery box.
What's wrong?
Kate called me.
And?
And I can't help her.
She won't tell me where she is.
I have a theory.
Conspiracy?
Of course.
Look at this.
Fowler's I.D.Number.
Over here, a local address.
Note the dates.
This is from before the diamond heist.
Yeah.It's a hotel room.
It's not linked to any operation I can find.
Now, if I was inclined to believe in such things,
I'd say it's worth a look.
Room 525.
Thanks, moz.
Open the door, Fowler!
Kate!
What are you doing here, Caffrey?
What's going on?
Who told you about this?Huh?
How do you know about mentor?
Mentor?
What do you think is going on here,huh?
You're busting an operation here.
No. No, where is kate?
Kate! Kate? Kate!!
Kate Moreau?
There's no kate here,Neal.
Kate?!
You're losing it.
You were watching me.
Before the jewelry heist.
I'm not in New York looking at you, Neal.
That's a lie.You recorded my phone calls.
No, I didn't bug your phone, Neal.
Hello, Kate.
Hello, Peter
