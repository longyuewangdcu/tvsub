Does Elena enjoy having both of you worship at her altar?
I love you. Now look me in the eye and tell me
that you don't feel something for him.
I would know if I were killing people.
You wear a ring that lets you cheat death, Ric.
How many times can you die before it changes you?
You have a weapon that can kill Klaus?
Nope. We all have a weapon.
Let's go kill some originals.
When an original dies,
every vampire turned in their bloodline dies along with them.
Bring us the stakes...
Or I'll wage a war against everyone you love.
Where the hell is it?
I put it right here!
A stake doesn't just vanish into thin air!
Are you telling me
that your vampire hating alter ego has a stake
that could kill an entire line of vampires, possibly mine?
That's exactly what I'm telling you.
Alaric?
Yeah?
Still me.
You know you shouldn't be in here.
Defeats the point of the whole being locked in a cellar thing.
Well, you still need the basics.
Toothbrush, clothes, some boring books to help you sleep.
"Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"?
What?
No, I got--
Damon. Thinks he's hilarious.
At least one of us still has a sense of humor.
Are you sure that you--I mean,
you don't have to be kept in here.
Oh, no, this is...
Ah, this is the right place for me to be.
At least until you guys can
convince my highly uncooperative alter ego to 'fess up to where I--
Or...he hid the white oak stake.
We looked everywhere.
You...The other you hid it well.
What's Klaus going to do if you can't find it?
It's the only thing that will kill him, so...
Wage war. Murder people.
You know, Klaus stuff.
Listen...
Stefan is going to watch over you for a little while.
Now that Klaus knows where Jeremy is,
it's not safe. So...
Damon and I are going to go to Denver to pick him up.
Why do you say that like you're waiting for me to disapprove?
I don't know.
Me and Damon,
traveling across the country.
Well, I guess I'm more curious
to hear what Stefan has to say about it.
Actually, it was his idea.
He thinks that I have some unresolved feelings for Damon.
Do you?
I guess that's why I'm going on this trip.
So I can figure it out.
Did you hear from Klaus?
Not yet. I'm sure I will soon, though.
He's expecting me to deliver two stakes.
I only have one.
Well, that's going to be disappointing for him.
I'll get it out of Alaric. I just need some time.
I like that confidence, Stefan.
I don't share it, but I like it.
You don't think I can do what it takes?
Well, you're good Stefan again. You're in control.
Sorry, you might get the girl but you lose the edge.
Speaking of...
Have you ever flown first class?
Who did you have to compel for that?
Please. I used miles.
Stefan...
Be safe.
What is this?
It's the decade dance.
Remember, you made us sign up to help.
No.
This! The twenties.
We're doing the seventies.
It's too flashy, people.
It's supposed to be a speakeasy, not the world's fair.
Oh, good, you're here. We need help setting up the tables,
so get to it.
What do you think you're doing?
Somebody has to be in charge.
Yeah, me. I'm the chair of the dance committee.
The theme of the decade dance is the 1970s.
So you'd rather dress in tacky colors with bad hair
than be a classic flapper from the jazz age.
Honestly, I don't know what my brother sees in you.
Well, maybe he sees a challenge.
See, unlike some other people,
I don't sleep with everyone I make eye contact with.
Maybe we can do both decades.
No.
Go on, Matt, don't be a coward.
You know you loved my twenties idea when I presented it to the group.
Traitor!
Bell bottoms and disco?
I don't know, this just seemed cooler.
See, it's just cooler.
Whatever. Have fun at your stupid dance.
Caroline!
Wait!
Impressive.
You sold it.
And you bought yourself a day.
Thank you. Just... keep her occupied.
Be careful.
You, too.
And, uh...
Tell him I said hi, ok?
Do you know how hard it is to fall asleep
when that's what you're supposed to do?
Well, look, I know it's not easy,
So...Damon suggested I bring something to--
help speed up the process.
What the hell.
You know, I'll feel decidedly less pathetic
if I don't drink alone.
Oh, I'm, uh, one step ahead of you.
So...Ahem.
Road trip, huh?
Yeah, yeah, I needed to stay here.
Why?
I mean, why you?
You know, it doesn't take much to baby-sit me
while I sit here waiting for a psychotic break.
Well, unfortunately, we only have
a limited amount of time.
Before what?
Before we have to resort to other methods.
So you're worried you're going to have to torture it out of me.
And you don't think Damon could have done that?
Look, Elena needed to go on that road trip with Damon.
No matter what I go through...
to get her back--
fighting my blood lust,
trying to gain control of my life again...
None of that matters if she has feelings for somebody else.
There he is.
Next time we compel him,
remind me to make him better at baseball.
Hey, Jer.
Elena?
What's wrong?
Katherine sired us, Rose sired Katherine,
all we need to do is find out who sired Rose.
So you traveled across the country
to get me to talk to a dead vampire?
Dead vampire's redundant but yes.
Well, I can't.
I can talk to Anna and Vicki because I knew them.
I've never even met Rose.
What good is you dying and coming back to life
if you can't talk to a ghost when I need you to?
Rose spent a long time running from Klaus as well.
She and Damon were close,
So maybe we can use you as a connection.
Fine, fine. Can we do this later?
My friend just got here.
And yes, Damon, I actually have some.
I'll call you when I'm done.
Jer...
Hey, man.
Damon, it's Kol!
What the hell are you doing?!
Jeremy, get back, he's an original!
What?!
No hard feelings, mate, but we're not buds.
You know, I'll never get used to aluminum.
But, hey, at least it won't break.
Did you kill him?
No, but it'll give us a head start. Come on.
Come on.
For the record, she's the one who wanted to stop in a motel, not me.
So where are we?
Corner of somewhere and nowhere where Kol can't find us.
I can't believe Kol was a vampire.
Well, didn't you find it weird that you made a friend so fast?
Have you met you?
Not helping.
This should work. Right, Jer?
Yeah. It doesn't really matter.
All right, whoopi.
What do you need, candles, incense, pottery wheel?
That's not how it works.
I know, I know. They push from the other side
And you pull from this one.
All right, you, uh, you got a picture of her?
Picture? From what, our trip to Disneyland?
Come on, Rose, you're not going to actually make us wait, are you?
I know you're obsessed with me.
All right, uh,
Tell me something about her.
Um, well,
she did this little thing with her tongue.
Something that matters, Damon.
She spent her last day in paradise.
Soaking in the sun and
reminiscing about what it means to be human.
And when death came,
she didn't fear it.
I was with her on her last day,
and she definitely wasn't in paradise.
It was in the dream he gave her.
She's here.
You have no idea how much I've missed you.
Here we are. Home sweet home.
Ok, spill. Why are you being nice to me?
I drove you home. You don't have a car.
Not just that. I mean... Helping me with the dance
and standing up to Caroline.
I don't buy it.
Buy what?
The whole gentlemanly thing.
After everything my family's done to you.
What are you up to?
It's sad that you can't just get a ride home from school
without thinking there's some ulterior motive.
You're right.
But I'm probably going to organize the whole dance
and then have to compel myself a date.
Let's not get crazy.
Good-bye, Rebekah.
Good-bye, Matt.
Thanks for the ride home.
Mother...
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now.
Because I'm dying.
Is she lonely on the other side?
No. I enjoy it.
I was running so much when I was alive.
Now I have the freedom to do whatever I want.
She says not to worry, she's happy.
Is she still hot?
Tell him he's still dripping with sex, too.
Fine. Tell him I miss him.
She misses you.
And tell him that I'm rooting for him and Elena.
She, uh, she misses both of you.
Unfortunately I don't have any news on the siring front.
Klaus didn't sire me. No original did.
It was Mary Porter.
She was sired by someone named mary porter.
Ahh, scary Mary.
Well, where is she, Rose?
I didn't keep track of her when I was alive, much less now.
Tell them to sit tight. Relax.
I'll see what I can find out.
You think they got Jeremy by now?
They should.
I haven't heard from them.
Elena's worried about him.
Now that she can't count on his ring anymore.
Who knows. Maybe his alter ego's a pot-smoking, hippie pacifist.
Yeah, maybe.
I can't say
I thought mine would be so hostile and militant.
Actually, it makes perfect sense.
Your wife left you to become a vampire
and your girlfriend was killed by one.
He must really hate me.
Here I am,
the failed hunter-slash- drinking buddy
of vampires.
Ah. He's too judgmental.
The thing is...
He's me.
I'm not compelled, I'm not possessed.
There's no humanity switch.
What drives him...
is me.
No.
No, he's not you.
He's the darkest parts of you.
Parts we all have.
Well, this is depressing, isn't it?
Oh, and I found this upstairs.
Now by my count, there should be one more.
Yeah, well, it's going to take a little more time.
Why, because we're waiting for that one to pass out?
No, thanks. I think I'll just kill him.
Well, then you won't know the location of the other stake.
I can live with that.
Well, I can't.
When we staked Finn,
we discovered that killing an original vampire
killed its entire bloodline.
Now, I don't know which one of you
I'm descended from,
but I'd really rather not find out by dying,
so why don't we just find the stake, destroy it
so we can all be safe?
So the fate of the entire vampire race
depends on you finding the stake.
And to get it, we need you to pass out.
Which means that I feel totally justified doing this.
There.
Sleeping like a baby.
There you are.
Any sign of evilaric?
Nope. Only dead Alaric.
What?
Don't worry, he was wearing his ring.
Klaus was here. Let's just say he's not very patient.
Kol must have told him we were in denver.
How long has Ric been out?
A few hours. I'm hoping when he wakes up,
it won't be him. It'll be the other him.
And if not?
Yeah, I know.
Whatever it takes.
So were you able to contact Rose?
Yeah. No answers yet.
So we're just stuck in this motel until she gets back to us.
Motel?
Yeah, we had to get away from Kol.
I'll call you when I know more.
So what's up with you and Damon?
What do you mean? Nothing's up.
You sure about that?
'cause even Rose said something.
What--what did she say?
Everything ok in here?
Yeah. It's fine.
Ok. Well,
I'm going to freshen up.
You might want to get some rest.
I'm sure Rose will make herself known when she gets back.
How are you dying?
I thought Ayana had preserved your body with a spell.
She did. I'm drawing my power from the Bennett witch line.
When Abby died, the connection was severed.
So my body is weakened.
Well, if you've come to spend your last moments
with your loving daughter, prepare to be disappointed.
You should have spent last time plotting my death.
Is that what you think I've been doing on the other side?
I've been looking over you for a thousand years
of joy and heartbreak.
Your fights with Klaus.
The nights you cried yourself to sleep calling out my name.
Not a day has gone by
that I wasn't right there with you.
And yet you still tried to kill me.
Because it shouldn't have been a thousand years, Rebekah.
No one should live that long.
But I haven't lived at all.
Sorry, Rebekah.
So, so sorry.
What's going on?
She's dead.
Did I mention I miss you?
Bad.
At some point, we are going to do this
on an actual bed, right?
Yes. I promise.
Once I figure out how to deal with Klaus.
Tell him to suck it.
Broke his sire bond.
And you won't have to deal with him anymore.
It's easier said than done.
Besides, I won't know if it's broken for sure until I test it.
Wait, I thought that's why you were coming back.
Because you said you felt different.
I do feel different.
I feel freer.
Way more myself.
All I know is, I just turned about a hundred times
in the Appalachian Mountains.
If I can get through that, I can get through anything.
Good.
Because Klaus might not be our only problem.
Why?
What else I miss?
Matt killed an original.
And then, every vampire that original had ever turned
mysteriously died.
Right now Damon is desperate to figure out
which original created our vampire blood line.
And...If he finds out it wasn't Klaus,
they're all going to kill him.
But Klaus turned me.
So if he dies...I die.
I know that.
They know that.
Difference is...
Damon doesn't care.
You never told me about that.
What you did for Rose.
It wasn't about you.
Why you don't let people see the good in you?
Because when people see good,
they expect good.
And I don't want to have to live up
to anyone's expectations.
Don't.
Why not, Elena?
Elena?
Oh, my god. Jeremy.
Rose found Mary. She lives in Kansas.
Ok, then.
Let's go.
Welcome back.
What happened?
Did I, uh... No.
No, you pretty much, uh,
laid there dead for half the night.
But on the, uh, on the plus side...
I did almost finish reading "Moby Dick."
This is stupid.
Evil me, or whatever you want to call him,
he's not going to make an appearance.
Why would he?
I mean, the best hiding place is the one
where you can't find the person who hid it.
I know.
So how do you want to do this?
I don't want to do any of this.
Well, that makes two of us.
But I don't think we have much choice in the matter.
Wait a minute, what are you doing?
You need that ring.
No, what I need is hope
that my alter ego doesn't have a death wish.
So I'm taking bets
that my dark side has a sense of self-preservation.
So let's see if he defends himself against death.
Look, Alaric,
I'm not going to kill you, ok?
If we have any chance at this, Stefan,
You're going to have to try.
This is the address.
Looks about right.
Wait here.
Why? So you guys can make out some more?
Don't be a dick.
Listen to your sister.
Thank you.
Come on.
Like "Vampire hoarders."
Who is this Mary person?
Scary Mary. Really old,
Super creepy.
And how do you know her?
You know.
Of course.
What? I said creepy,
not ugly.
Mary...
Quite contrary.
You're not putting enough into this.
Any more into it,
I'm going to break your spine.
Well, don't back down now.
Oh, no, no, no, no. I can't.
The blood.
Oh, come on, you're past that.
No, I'm not.
Then use it.
Give into it.
Try to kill me, Stefan, come on.
Not like this, Alaric.
Yes!
Like this.
You're going to have to want to kill me
for me to believe that you will.
I go this far, I may not be able to stop.
You want the answers from my darkest side,
you're going to have to tap into yours.
So don't back down.
Don't fight it. Just do it.
Do it!
You're so weak.
Look at you.
One of nature's most hideous creatures,
and you can't even get that right.
You...
Me.
Shame about Mary. She used to be a blast.
I don't quite know what happened.
I fear all the time she
spent with my family might have ruined her.
She was a bit of an original groupie.
And were you her favorite?
You mean, did I turn her.
I think I did.
But, no, wait. Maybe it was Rebekah.
But there was also a Klaus period.
And let's not forget the Elijah affair.
I spoke to my brother. I know you're trying
to find out who you descended from.
Now you never will.
So...
Where did we leave off?
Elena, get out of here!
According to my brother, you're off-limits.
Just don't test me.
Don't touch her.
Oh, dear.
I've hit the nerve.
Relax, darling.
I just want us to be even.
You snapped my neck, you killed my brother,
and then you humiliated me.
There.
Now we're even.
Where's the stake?
You're worse than I ever was.
Spineless. Pathetic.
Tell me where the stake is before I kill you.
You know, you're all going to burn.
Ashes to dust.
Where's the stake?!
I'm going to kill you in 3...
2...1.
It's in the cave.
Where no vampire can get it.
That wasn't too hard, was it?
Are you ok?
Ah. Yeah.
That's better.
Are you ok? You're bleeding.
Yeah. I'll be fine.
Good.
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
Well, going on this trip and kissing me...
What the hell is this?
Stefan thinks that I have feelings for you.
Do you?
I don't--I don't--I don't know.
I guess you thought this little
trip could help you figure that out, didn't you?
No. Or maybe you're hoping I'll screw it up
so I can just make the decision for you, am I wrong?
Damon...
Am I wrong?
It's what you do, Damon!
You sabotage things. You--
I mean, think about it. Every time that
there's a bump in the road, you lash out.
But what if I didn't?
What if there was no bump?
I'm sorry, Elena.
But this time I'm not going to make it so easy for you.
This time you'll have to figure it out for yourself.
It's a little gratuitous,
don't you think, Stefan? I would have been more gentle.
I'm going to take him to the caves.
You're going to go inside and fetch me the stake.
And if you think you can hide, you're wrong.
And then there was one.
I know about your brother's little mission to Denver.
He failed.
Not that that's news anymore.
So what are you going to do now, Klaus?
Are you going to kill me?
I haven't actually decided yet.
Oh, sure you have.
See, you've had every chance
and every excuse imaginable to do it, but yet you haven't.
Which means you don't want to.
You know something, you're right.
See, I'm still waiting for my old friend to come back.
By the looks of it, he's just beneath the surface.
Waiting to come out and play.
Right, ripper?
I've been fighting that part of myself.
Thinking that if I repress it, it would go away.
But it won't.
And now that I've accepted it,
it can't control me.
And neither can you.
So...
unless you're going to stake me.
Why don't you get the hell out of my house.
Are we there yet?
Don't tell them I'm here.
They had a fight.
I know you want to stop it.
Protect her from it.
But you're young. You don't see what I see.
It's not just that she makes him a better person.
She does, but... he changes her, too.
Damon challenges her.
Surprises her.
He makes her question her life.
Beliefs.
Stefan is different.
His love is pure.
And he'll always be good for her.
Damon is either the best thing for her,
or the worst.
My mom said you can stay as long as you want.
Did she say we could share the bed?
No. She said you can sleep on the couch.
At least until we figure out
what Damon and Stefan find out about Klaus.
And if Klaus didn't create their line?
And they try to kill him?
Tyler... I just got you back.
I'm not losing you again.
Klaus drew this for you?
Huh?
That's...pretty creepy.
Yeah.
Klaus is pretty creepy.
Even when he's trying to be charming.
Charming?
Does Klaus have a thing for you or something?
No! As far as I'm concerned,
he isn't capable of real feelings.
I'm serious.
What the hell happened while I was gone?
Tyler. Nothing.
Ok, nothing happened.
Then why'd you keep this?
I don't know.
I think I'm going to find some place else to spend the night.
Tyler...
Tyler!
Go get it.
You know I can't get in.
Why would I give you
the one thing that requires everyone to keep me alive?
Are we bargaining now?
Fine.
What's your offer?
There's only one stake out there.
Which means only one original has to die.
Help me.
And I'll make sure it's not you.
Tenuous, but points for effort.
You see, I don't want one original to die.
I want them all to die.
How the hell did you do that?
It was easy to fool Niklaus,
but I thought you, of all people, would understand.
After all, my son did use your body at one point.
You're not Rebekah.
No.
My name is Esther.
