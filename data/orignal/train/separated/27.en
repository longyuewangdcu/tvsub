Zach, you're 14 years old.
You are a freshman in high school.
You had a junior in your room yesterday with the door closed.
The computer stays here.
You know those envelopes on your doorstep--
they're just the beginning. I have a lot more.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Somebody's trying to set up dad.
Zach, this is serious.
Did anything come for me at the apartment that I didn't get?
Like what?
I don't know. A package or something?
Is this fake, too?
I don't know.
Last year, Glenn wiretapped your phones.
What?
I saw the recordings on his computer.
I said I might come over.
I thought you said...
Well, Laya wants to go to the Riviera to see the Prairie Cartel.
Is that a stuffed elephant behind you there, Zachary?
Well, that is adorable.
I had no idea that you collected stuffed animals.
I'm in my sister's room.
Oh, bro-sis bonding night.
That's very sweet.
My mom moved my computer into the living room.
It's been 20 minutes already.
Just... five more.
You're not even supposed to be on my computer.
So use mine.
Mom's out there.
I have spent the last year nannying full time,
But with grad school, I can really only do part time.
And you're at Northwestern?
Yes.
A dual master's in business and educational psychology.
I'm really interested in child development.
Uh, have you heard of the EMT?
The educational measurement test.
My father created it.
You're not even supposed to be talking to anybody.
Why do you care?
Because it's my computer.
If you're not gonna be using it,
Then really, who cares?
It's mine!
I'm from a big family.
Six brothers and sisters.
Anyway, um, part time is perfect for us.
I'm just looking for someone who can cover the hours
that my mother-in-law can't be here.
So, this would be afternoons?
Evenings?
Yes.
Uh, I was hoping that someone could start next week.
So, I will call your references,
and we'll be in touch.
Good.
Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.
Bye.
Hello?
Alicia. Hi, sorry. It's Will.
I know you just got home,
but I just got a call from Memorial North.
The hospital?
Yeah. We signed them a month ago.
You have your own in the other room.
Would you both stop arguing about the computer?!
Exactly. So tell Grace...
This is ridiculous.
The administrator called.
Seems like they got a bit of a fluid situation over there
involving a possible malpractice suit.
A possible one?
Yes. I think they're being overcautious,
but they just came off a million-dollar malpractice payout,
so we jump through hoops.
They got a call ten minutes ago from a paramedic
coming in with a heater.
A heater?
A high-profile patient.
I don't have all the details, but it sounds like an OD to me.
I need someone to get over there,
make sure if this does turn into a malpractice suit,
we got our ducks in a row. Okay?
Look, I know we've been asking a lot of you lately.
So, if you want me to put this on Cary, I can.
No. I've got it.
Thank God. I thought he was sending out Cary.
What's going on?
Ben Bowers,
Gables High star quarterback,
USU recruit, collapsed on the field.
How's he doing?
I think we're going to find out now.
Mrs. Bowers...
Time to go to work.
I'm so sorry...
Get corporate compliance, HR, PR.
No, I have outside counsel.
Um, code was called at 8:35.
In-house called police.
8:45. They're on their way.
One shoe?
Where's the other shoe?
Police are five minutes away.
Is that his bag?
Uh, the paramedics brought it in.
"Dr. Wesley."
Is that the attending physician?
Yes.
Is he on staff?
Yes.
What?
80 milligrams.
Where's your doctor?
Wesley? I'll locate him. Why?
You got 80 milligrams oxycodone in a 17-year-old.
If you want to know when this went south,
This just went south.
Cops are two minutes away.
They take a half hour to call in detectives.
Another half hour to find these pills.
Doctor's got about 90 minutes before he gets arrested.
I have to get the board together.
First, get to your doctor
And make sure he exercises his Miranda.
I'll go with.
Kalinda.
Somehow I should've expected it.
Murphy.
Got here fast.
It's a heater on a Friday night.
What do you expect?
So you been documenting the scene?
Yep.
Yeah? Don't suppose you want to focus my eyes on the salient details?
Now where's the fun in that?
Damn.
Is that Dr. Wesley?
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Bowers.
I'm just so sorry.
He was only 17.
How... how does this...?
I don't know.
I want to see him.
I understand.
Dr. Wesley.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Please.
Do I know you?
I'm Alicia.
I'm a lawyer with Stern, Lockhart & Gardner.
You can't be talking with the mother right now.
Why not?
Your patient overdosed from pills you prescribed.
And there is some question about the dosage.
Even a simple expression of sympathy
could be construed as an admission of guilt.
Then it's an admission.
That's my patient. I'm their family doctor.
And I'm your lawyer.
If I was sick right now, I would do exactly as you told me to do.
But you're in trouble.
And I need you to do exactly as I tell you.
I-I'm in trouble? The police think...?
Please.
Where's your office?
The south tower.
I want you to go there.
Don't speak to anyone.
I know this is going to be difficult,
But promise me, please...
I'd never put Ben in harm's way.
If you're my attorney, I want you to know that.
This is going to be huge, isn't it?
The press, people...
Block it out.
Alicia, right?
Yes.
I'm Shawn.
We'll speak soon.
He's a Florrick kid.
You got to give him a minute.
You sure you're going to be warm enough there, Zachary?
This is Laya.
Zach! Zach! Come here, Zach!
Zach!
She had a stroke.
She's still unconscious, but stable.
Which hospital?
Harbor.
The kids couldn't get through to 911,
so Becca drove them there.
Becca?
She's Zach's friend. It's a long story.
She-she drove, so she's...
She's 16.
Zach was sneaking out to go to a concert.
I already talked to him.
I need to get out of here.
Okay.
Look, there's an excellent neurologist,
His name is Dr. Hester,
And he's at St. Michael's.
You need to get him over to Harbor to evaluate her.
He's going to tell you that he's busy,
But you just say to him that I'd greatly appreciate it.
I phoned your sister.
I bet that went well.
She wants updates.
I'm going to have Golden apply for a sick bed visit.
We're going to need a critically ill notification
from the attending physician.
And unfortunately,
we bear the cost of a supervised visit.
Could be... a couple thousand.
You need to see her.
Thank you.
How are you?
I'm...
It's been a busy 48 hours.
I found someone to fill in at home.
She had good references.
And,
I'm going to take over Jackie's power of attorney, for the time being.
Of course.
So I just need you to sign...
And just, initial the next page.
You and Golden can talk about it later.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
This is just odd.
I started the day with one lawyer, and now I have ten.
Your issues are our issues, Shawn.
Thank you for posting my bail.
For standing by me.
Of course.
We want to see you cleared.
Now, due to the popularity of the victim...
Ben.
Yes, Ben.
We believe the state's attorney's office is guilty of legal overreach.
They have charged you with murder,
which is a sign of their desperation.
It's a charge aimed at headlines.
Isn't that bad?
Hi.
No, it probably means they don't intend to bring it to trial.
They just want to get a plea bargain with some jail time.
Any jail time.
Which we won't accept.
Right. We just need to make them aware of the facts.
You prescribed the ten-milligram painkillers,
but not the 80-milligram.
That's right.
Good.
So we just need to find where these other drugs came from.
Our team will do some digging,
cut this off before it goes to trial.
No way.
You cannot be here.
Hi, Murphy.
Yeah, how did you even get in?
Hi, Li.
Kalinda. We miss you.
What's that, stomach contents?
Don't answer her.
Looks like you ran into the one cop
who can resist your charms, Kalinda.
Tell him about my sweet personality, Li.
Blueberries and sesame seeds.
Flax seeds and bananas.
Li, what did I just say?
So...
what's your take on the Florrick appeal?
I just keep my head down,
someone ends up signing the checks.
In a Street Fight, my money's on Florrick.
Same here.
So, was it the oxycodone, Li?
And alprazolam, ephedra.
Kid's got a pharmacy in his stomach.
Li, shut up.
See how easy that was?
Take care.
What are you doing here?
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Bowers.
I'm... I'm just trying to piece together what happened.
No, you're not.
You're trying to protect the doctor who killed my son.
Thank you.
I know your first instinct would be to slam the door in my face,
but I ju...
He was a good boy.
You should be trying to fight for him.
I just want to know the truth.
No, you don't.
You're a lawyer.
Everyone's painting my son as some kind of drug addict.
And everyone's painting Dr. Wesley as some kind of pill pusher.
So help me.
Help me figure out how Ben got those drugs in his system.
I'm not sure what you want to hear.
My son didn't hang around with drug dealers.
I know, but maybe a friend,
or the football coach...
No.
I knew all the people in his life.
Kids aren't always forthcoming.
Ben didn't really have the time.
I mean, he was either at school or-or-or practice or the gym.
I mean, that was his life.
Maybe it was too much. I don't know.
I'm a single mom.
You know, you can't... see everything.
You can't...
be there all the time.
When they fall...
I was reading a story
by one of the moms of the Columbine killer.
And I thought to myself,
"oh, my God.
I understand."
Molly. Everything okay?
Doing great.
Grace is in her room,
And, um, Zach's friend Becca is here.
Really?
Where are they?
Well, actually,
I asked them to stay in the living room,
if you don't mind. I just felt more comfortable with that.
Yes. Thank you.
And Mrs. Florrick is there anything you don't eat?
Because I'm making a lasagna,
but I can make it meatless if you want.
No, anything's fine, Molly.
Thanks.
Okay. I was just checking in.
Look, maybe he OD'd on the oxycodone,
but where did the alprazam and ephedra come from?
Is that the stomach contents?
And his last meal.
Flax seeds, blueberries and bananas.
What's the history on the hospital parking ER patients?
What do you mean?
You know, making them wait.
No, I know what "parking" means,
But what do you mean?
The missing shoe.
I found it in an empty ER ward.
I was wondering if they had parked him.
You do know the hospital is our client.
Yes.
But if they're vulnerable...
then we deal with that.
What did you get from his mom?
Not much.
Ben didn't do much more than study, work out.
What gym?
Um, Iron Muscle. Why?
Flax seeds and bananas.
Sounds like a power smoothie.
Yeah, gym's a good place to score some ephedra.
I read an article.
Something you can't do yourself?
Poor little me.
I need a man.
She wanted to get engaged right out of law school.
Her dad's Patrick J. Brown.
You know who that is?
No.
Eh, well, he's Fortune 500, semiconductors.
But I said no.
I mean, 26 and married.
Cary, you know I'm not listening to a word you're saying, right?
Here, let me spot you.
Are you seeing someone?
Okay, when they go into the locker room,
don't approach them.
Just watch the exchange
and I'll make the approach later.
I'm sorry, did you hear my question?
Do you have a boyfriend?
Do I have a boyfriend?
Yeah.
No.
I have the stuff you were asking about.
That's all of it?
It looks different.
New mix. You'll love it.
All right. Looks good.
Later.
Hey, let's say I want to bulk up.
What?
Let's say I want to bulk up, I want to pay for it.
You got anything for me?
Sure.
First one's free.
What's this?
It's homemade acai berry supplement.
I don't sell drugs.
All right.
Well, if you think of somebody who does,
here's my number.
Thanks, man.
Yeah.
A wiretap?
Right.
How reliable is your source?
Reliable. It's Alicia.
Childs' ex-wife told her.
All right, um...
Assuming that it's true,
and I file a motion to compel production of the taps,
whatever is on those taps will come out.
Right.
The good and the bad.
I mean, if there is anything on those tapes,
that will work against us...
Well...
that's a lot to consider.
And if you could just help me with your handwriting here.
Yeah, sorry, wretched penmanship's a job requirement.
Uh, patellar.
Uh, analgesic.
Thank you, Alicia.
For?
For keeping this from feeling like it's spinning out of control.
You said you saw Ben before he went to school.
That's when you prescribed the oxycodone?
Yes.
But... your shift didn't start until 10:00 that morning.
Oh. Right.
I saw him at home before I went to work.
He had an appointment scheduled for noon,
but didn't want to miss class.
Give me a minute.
Diane?
He prescribed prescription narcotics to a teenager out of his house.
And then went into work and updated Ben's chart
as though there were an official hospital visit at noon.
He said he would've prescribed the exact same thing out of the office.
It's a game-changer.
As far as I'm concerned.
Good job.
Thanks for discovering it.
So, you want to walk away?
The prosecution can argue there was no valid doctor's visit.
There's a falsified medical record.
So, do you want to walk away?
I think it's the smart thing to do.
Please let Dr. Wesley know
the hospital can no longer be involved in his defense.
Sorry to hear about your divorce.
Thank you.
I was being sarcastic.
I want your help.
With?
The Florrick appeal.
Prior knowledge to evidence he's bringing,
where and how he's getting it, from whom...
How many investigators do you have
at the state's attorney's office, Glenn?
You have special knowledge from working with him directly.
That was a long time ago.
I have a different job now.
You can work two.
How much?
No money.
I don't think you understand how exposed you are
from your past work with the state's attorney's office.
Subpoenas stopped at Florrick
only because I wanted them stopped at Florrick.
You're trying to tie me to his scandal.
You are tied to his scandal.
I am offering to keep the record sealed
if you give me what I want, that's all.
I'm so sorry.
What happened to my issues being the hospital's?
I don't think I can answer that.
So I prescribe from home.
It was a minor infraction.
It wasn't anything unusual.
If a patient needs help,
I give it regardless of where...
It's a relief for them, isn't it?
The hospital isn't liable anymore, I am.
I can't really afford you without the hospital's support,
but I could... pay you in installments.
You want me to continue?
I could end up with a public defender who...
I'd rather stick with you.
But the hospital dumped you because of me.
So make it up to me.
Dr. Wesley knows you're the one who brought this to us?
Yes. If North Memorial waives conflict...
That's a big "if."
It's still best for them if Dr. Wesley is cleared,
especially if they're vulnerable on other questions.
On his own dime?
But it'll just be you.
We've already reassigned Kalinda and Cary.
Okay.
Jackie?
You look good.
Well, I'm just trying to get some life back in me.
What?
What did I do now?
Whenever you're given a compliment,
you take it as criticism.
No, I don't.
Anyway, thank you for phoning me.
Well, I-I just... I...
You're welcome.
So, uh...
You hired this girl Molly to watch Grace and Zach.
Yes, I did.
I don't like her.
Really?
I know that look.
You think I don't like her because she's taking my place.
Yes, I do.
She's pushy.
She's-she's a know-it-all.
Peter's going to try and get out to come see you.
You trying to make me feel good?
Yes, I am, but it's true.
Take these with a full glass of water, Mrs. Florrick.
What are these orange ones?
Five milligrams warfarin.
How can you be sure?
A practiced eye.
Not to worry.
Dropping off or picking up?
Actually, I was wondering if you could help me, Jill.
My mother-in-law is very nervous about taking her pills,
and I need to explain
how pills are prescribed and dispensed.
Do you mind?
She's such a nuisance.
Sure.
So, aren't you breaking the rules, having me in here?
The door's open.
Aren't you breaking the rules, having me in here?
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do to you?
Does she do this for you?
Does she?
It's...
Your dad's sex tape?
Say...
"Just don't stop."
Say it.
Just don't stop.
Molly?
You know Zach and Becca are in his room?
They wanted to play some music, so I said it was all right.
I don't think my mom wanted them to.
It's okay.
Zach just needs a little bit of, um,
independence and trust right now.
I don't want to infantilize him.
Want to help me with dinner?
Sure.
It's all about tracking and barcoding.
When we take 20 pills out of stock,
we scan the prescription bottle to log the pills,
then scan the stock bottle.
In theory, it all reconciles at the end of the day.
In theory?
Well, not everyone is diligent.
Some think when we're busy, they can just skip the barcoding.
When the computer reminds them, they just manually override the warning.
Is there any way you could tell me
if a certain prescription has been barcoded?
Was it filled here?
You have the Rx number?
My mother-in-law, she takes pictures of all her pills.
I know. It's a bit anal.
B. Bowers.
Four ten-milligram oxycodone.
See?
That's what I'm talking about.
Not barcoded.
Terrible.
I am plea bargaining. Your doctor's dirty.
There's nothing linking...
He prescribed Ben Bowers oxycodone,
And Ben Bowers died of an oxycodone overdose.
That's a link.
And you have a task force
looking into pill pushers at local gyms,
one of which...
Is Peter holding up okay?
Peter?
Yes. How is he?
I... he's fine.
We have an associate looking into one of these pill pushers
at Ben's exact gym...
I can do one year in jail.
Suspended medical license.
No.
I'm sorry?
One year probation, no jail time.
Dr. Wesley prescribed ten-milligram pills for Ben.
And the pharmacy may have dispensed incorrectly.
May have? Really?
Are we playing "may haves"?
Check with the pharmacy. They didn't barcode the transaction.
For all we know, they gave him 80-milligram pills by mistake.
That's reasonable doubt.
Go ahead. Give them a call.
I'll wait.
So, here we are again.
Yeah, here we are.
You know, I've only been fired once in my life.
You still holding a grudge?
Giving you a chance to correct a mistake.
But my rates have gone up.
Well, what are your qualifications?
Childs asked me to work for him.
To do what?
Outbid him.
We have some funds, but, um...
We'll need to know the nature of the information you could supply.
Childs tapped my home.
We don't want to subpoena those tapes
Unless we can preview them.
Without him knowing?
So, I think you should accept Childs' job offer.
Work for him.
And for us.
That should be a familiar feeling for you.
I always did like you.
I think I'm in love.
This doesn't feel like good news.
When I gave you the go-ahead to represent Dr. Wesley,
I thought you knew not to sacrifice a major client for a minor one.
I didn't... I didn't say anything about the parking.
Were you aware that
Middle Woods pharmacy is owned in part by Memorial North?
No.
You gave the ASA information
suggesting the pharmacy was at fault in Ben's death.
I pointed out that their inventory method left a gray area,
which is true.
Well, true or not, the pharmacy is now under investigation,
And Memorial North wasn't too happy
to have their own firm point a finger at them.
They fired us.
This is our fault.
And we should have seen the potential for conflict.
But put Dr. Wesley's case to bed.
Make the best deal you can and get it off your docket now.
You asked me to follow upon the information.
As part of Dr. Wesley's case,
not to launch a new one against the pharmacy.
I felt it was my professional duty to follow through.
By the way, the pharmacy may not have barcoded Ben's prescription,
but they also didn't have 80-milligram oxy in stock that day.
You just lost reasonable doubt.
If we could get his jail time down to four months,
instead of a year...?
That was yesterday's deal. It's four years now,
and a revoked medical license.
So, we take it to trial.
If that's what you want to do,
I can help find you a lawyer to step in.
What?
Why?
My firm has asked me to settle this
or help you find new representation.
Four years in prison, I...
My life would be over, my career.
I need a vacation.
Yeah.
He's facing four years in prison,
the loss of his job,
and you know what?
I didn't care.
You?
I wanted his problems out of the office.
What's that say about me?
Says you're becoming a lawyer.
I'm amazed at how little I know about you.
What do you want to know?
I'm not sure.
Great.
Two things.
I looked at the paramedic's run sheet.
You're right, the times don't add up.
Looks like they parked Ben for 15 minutes.
That's pretty damning.
But privileged.
Yeah, only if we represent them.
Right now, we don't.
You want to blackmail the hospital to make them our client again?
I like it.
Yeah, strategic.
Second thing's even better.
The gym guy
wants to sell me some oxycodone.
Are you and Grace in therapy?
In...? No.
Family therapy.
All this stuff with your father.
That... no, we're fine.
It can have a serious effect on your psychosexual development.
I don't even think about it that much.
Zach, you've got pictures on your computer of your dad
with a hooker and a crack pipe.
How do you...?
What are you talking about?
I saw them when I was checking my e-mail.
Does your mom know?
Don't tell her.
You don't understand what's going on here.
Dinner in ten minutes.
So, homemade acai berry supplement.
Yeah.
Did you try it?
No, not my speed.
It's good stuff.
Sometimes you need a little more.
You got knee pain?
Yep. Stay awake at night crying.
Oxycodone isn't cheap.
Well, try me. I got a good job.
These 80s?
Yep.
How much?
Twenty.
How much for ten?
200.
And for a first-time customer, I'll throw in a free vike.
All right.
You sure you don't need some 'roids?
Just looking at your muscle mass, you could do with some.
What's wrong with my muscle mass?
Nothing wrong with my muscle mass.
Hold it right there! Oh, no, you don't!
Don't move!
See how good I am at repaying favors?
What do we have here, the proverbial black book, hmm?
These all your customers?
Don't I have the right to remain silent?
You recognize one?
You sold to Ben Bowers...
The high school football player who OD'd.
You sold to him.
No, I never sell to kids.
What a humanitarian.
Stop lying.
It's here.
Mrs. Bowers, being too formal?
Yes, Trey sold to me.
I met him at the gym.
Th-things were just really hard.
My job and stress.
Ben never knew about it.
He didn't have access to these, I swear.
I counted them.
There are exactly 11.
May I?
Look.
They look identical.
But kids take aspirin tablets,
shave off the markings and ridges, round the edges
so they look like oxy tablets.
See?
Then they swap out the real oxy with the fakes
so it looks like no pills are missing.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
So you two are good, aren't you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why?
And you know you can come to me with anything, right?
Like what?
I don't know.
Anything.
Do you think I should get the HPV vaccine?
The HPV?
It's an STD,
and you can get a shot and it'll...
Yes, I know what it is.
Where's this coming from?
Molly says that we're hypersexualized because of dad.
She what?!
Yeah, and she said that she got the HPV vaccine
and that I could get it, too.
Okay, so this is something we talk about together.
Not with Molly.
Okay.
You're fired.
Why?
Let me give you a little lesson for your next job.
The next time you want to talk to your charges
about sexually- transmitted diseases,
Talk to the parents.
What?!
This is for the rest of the week. Thank you.
I never said anything about sexually-transmitted diseases.
They said I said that?
Oh, they're lying.
Take the check.
It's because of what I saw on their computer.
That's why.
Thank you.
You don't know what's going on in your own home, lady!
He shoots from 12 and it's good.
Chicago up by nine.
Well?
They're looking for wiretaps.
My wife told them.
They want me to locate the recordings.
How would you do that?
Through you.
Why doesn't he just subpoena me?
He's worried what's on it.
Or he doesn't remember what's on it.
Where you going?
Home.
I'm not done here.
Glenn, if you want this to work,
you need to give me something to give them.
Phone me when you have it.
I'm so glad you made it.
Are they taking good care of you, mom?
Good enough.
Do you need anything?
No, I'm fine.
I'm just happy to have you all in one room.
Yeah.
So...
Really?
Is Molly filling my shoes at home?
No, mom got rid of her.
What?
Lasted three whole days.
You were right.
Well, I just...
Thank you.
We miss you, grandma.
Oh, you do not.
We do.
Childs is gonna give her a listen to the taps.
Looks like she came through.
Peter, your appeal, how's it going?
Well, you know what, mom?
There's been some new developments.
