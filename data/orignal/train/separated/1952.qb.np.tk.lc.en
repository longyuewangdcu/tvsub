the human brain .
this is the reason i asked dr. grey
if i could fill in for her this morning .
nature makes a beautiful machine .
don &apos;t you think ?
you might be surprised ,
but anatomy classes can be uncomfortable for surgeons .
ready to take it apart ?
we &apos;re trained to put bodies back together .
we prefer our tissue warm , alive .
see how easily the blade slices through ?
comes apart like warm butter .
this big ball of jelly
is the essential element that makes you ...
... you .
h @-@ here &apos;s a fun fact .
if left to decompose , the brain actually liquifies .
usually when a surgeon is staring at dead tissue ...
‭ - look out !
was it something i said ?
means that something is very , very wrong .
oh , god .
oh , god , please , please .
please , please , please .
oh , no , no .
no !
whoa .
hey .
oh , we had sex ?
we had sex . yeah , we had so much sex .
yeah , we did . and it was great .
i don &apos;t mean to rush out , but , uh --
there are people in this house , and , um ,
we had sex and you &apos;re an intern ...
yeah .
... so you -- you have to get out .
yeah , okay . bye .
stop . you -- there might be people out there .
there might be kids .
you have kids ?
my sister has kids . my sister could see you .
i mean , i don &apos;t hear anyone .
i think we &apos;re okay .
are you sure ?
yeah . we &apos;re fine .
well . good morning .
hey .
good morning .
you said you were drunk .
can i at least ask if you used a condom ?
shut ... up .
look , there is a jumbo box of condoms under the bathroom sink .
i share . they are for everyone .
jumbo ? seriously ?
i was being optimistic .
wait .
that was you making all that noise last night ?
i thought that was amelia .
well , you aren &apos;t shy . and you have a filthy mouth .
okay , can we not talk about this ?
please . i am begging you .
so , the intern was good in bed .
intern ? what intern ? maggie , what intern ?
alex can hear us .
alex doesn &apos;t care about this . do you care , alex ?
do i care about any of this conversation ? no .
did he visit ladytown ?
because i find if they don &apos;t
go down to ladytown the first time ,
there should be no next time .
she &apos;s right about that .
no more talking !
if either of you says another word ,
i will jump out of this car while it is moving .
and ladytown is just as bad as ladyplace .
geez . so sensitive .
just trying to be nice .
take an interest . god .
hey , what time do you want me at your house tonight ?
why are you coming to my house tonight ?
you &apos;re having a dinner party .
oh , the dinner party . no , that &apos;s not tonight .
no , that &apos;s weeks away . it &apos;s on the --
dinner party &apos;s on the 14th , alex .
today is the 14th .
you people need adult supervision .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna go to this dinner thing tonight .
i think i &apos;m gonna work .
jo , they don &apos;t hate you .
they don &apos;t like me .
they &apos;re your friends . they &apos;re my bosses .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m on call all the time .
they -- they treat me like a resident ,
not like a person , not like your girlfriend .
&apos;cause they only ever see you here
&apos;cause you never go to their parties .
go to the party . i want them to know you .
it &apos;ll be fun , i promise .
fun like a barium enema .
what ?
your boyfriend little posse controls this place .
jo , you have an invite to the inner circle .
you go to that party , you make friends
with the chiefs of neuro , cardio , and general ,
you would be unstoppable .
every surgery in this hospital would be yours .
that -- that dinner ...
i &apos;d kill for an invite .
you &apos;re a little bit scary right now .
edwards , my dear .
let &apos;s roll .
maybe i &apos;ll get an invite after all .
first neuro , then the world .
he didn &apos;t mean it , right ?
i mean , you don &apos;t just
toss the word &quot; divorce &quot; out there like that .
it was just the heat of the moment , right ?
maybe he was just mad , or --
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s mad .
&quot; divorce &quot; ? no . i refuse to accept it . refuse .
do you think he &apos;s going to that thing tonight ?
oh , god . probably .
are you going ? please tell me you &apos;re going .
i don &apos;t know . i mean , callie &apos;s gonna be there .
since when &apos;s that been an issue ? - it &apos;s not . it &apos;s just --
i don &apos;t want to make her new girlfriend feel uncomfortable .
you know , intimidated by me . mm .
i mean , if she &apos;s even bringing her .
i don &apos;t know if she &apos;s bringing her . do you ?
well , she &apos;s right over there .
do you want me to ask her if she &apos;s bringing her girlfriend ?
yes , please .
you ask about jackson , i &apos;ll ask about penny .
10 @-@ 4 .
oh , hey , um , about that thing tonight ,
i &apos;m not so sure any of them cook .
should i bring food just in case so none of us starve ?
you know , i think it &apos;s gonna be fine .
um , do you know if --
do you know if jackson &apos;s coming tonight ?
uh , no idea .
are you bringing penny ?
i hadn &apos;t --
uh , i didn &apos;t know if you &apos;d be okay with that .
and , uh -- yeah , i didn &apos;t want it to be awkward
or uncomfortable for her , you know . m--
okay ? me ?
oh , i &apos;m fine .
are you kidding ?
no , bring her . totally .
bring her , &apos; cause , i mean , i want to meet her .
i mean , i think that we all want to meet her .
yeah . i mean , not just me .
mostly me &apos; cause i --
i know that i would really love to meet her .
yeah .
i mean ...
i will see if she &apos;s available .
cool , cool .
mm @-@ hmm .
yeah .
see ? i can do this .
i can do this . i &apos;m excited .
it &apos;s cool , i &apos;m cool .
yeah , cool people don &apos;t say they &apos;re cool .
rachel bishop , 32,
post @-@ op day one following decompressive craniotomy .
isn &apos;t able to respond verbally ,
but is arousable and following motor commands .
excellent .
she is the perfect candidate for early ambulation .
you want to get her on her feet ?
she just had surgery yesterday .
that &apos;s exactly the point .
uh , new studies are showing
that if we get neuro patients up and moving
as soon as possible after surgery , they recover faster .
they have a greater return to function .
but the protocol is that we --
that is the great thing about being head of the department .
i decide what is and is not protocol .
yes , ma &apos;am .
uh ... call rachel &apos;s mother and suggest she not come in today .
it is gonna be a little rough .
uh , dr. shepherd , sorry ,
but dr. hunt said to round up all available interns .
why ? what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;re about to get hit with a silver flood .
i need fiber @-@ optic intubation on standby for each bed .
what do we got ?
silver flood .
okay , i need vitamin k , warm fluids ,
blankets , and bair huggers .
uh , what &apos;s a silver flood ?
a silver flood is a fracture feast .
i need slings , splints , and pelvic binders ,
as many as you can get your hands on .
silver flood ?
silver flood .
oh , and page every on @-@ call x @-@ ray tech .
haven &apos;t seen one of these since mercy west .
this will be fun .
yes , but what is it exactly ?
a silver flood is no regular day in the pit .
patients might be agitated , angry , possibly even violent .
use soothing tones , but do not speak too softly .
do not administer unnecessary fluids .
if you see bruising , think bleeding .
no narcotics , no benzos .
any questions ?
uh , y @-@ yes , what is a silver flood ?
i spent good money on that damn cruise ,
and the shuttle bus crashed before we even reached the port .
damn driver was fiddling with his phone the entire damn way .
so , he was -- he was texting ?
not on your life .
the way he was staring at that thing ,
it had to be porno .
all right , call the o.r. ,
tell them they need to have it ready for me yesterday .
go !
oh , silver flood .
well , what did you think it was ?
why do you need a code word for a bunch of old people ?
what ? we &apos;re not old people .
we &apos;re senior citizens .
disrespectful . calling people old .
who do you think you are ?
i &apos;m not old .
you don &apos;t know old .
you are rude .
that &apos;s why . have fun with that .
i want to speak to your supervisor .
thiazide for the blood pressure , metformin for my diabetes .
i also take another pill for my arthritis .
great , so -- - i &apos;m not done .
also some kind of cholesterol pill and a baby aspirin .
that &apos;s it .
eddie , are you sure you &apos;re not forgetting
some of the medications you might &apos;ve been on ,
like , say for , i don &apos;t know , uh ,
erectile dysfunction ?
do i look like the kind of guy
who needs to pop a pill to pop a woody ?
well , you know , i just got to ask .
&apos;cause if -- if you were
on one of those meds and you didn &apos;t tell us ,
then that could have a very bad reaction
based on any medications we might give you .
you could have a drop in blood pressure ,
you could have a stroke , you could have a heart attack .
you need proof ?
watch this .
no ! no , no , no !
that &apos;s okay .
that &apos;s -- please don &apos;t do that .
mrs. margraff , we are going to take you up to c.t.
and have you checked out , okay ?
i &apos;m not a mrs. , dear .
the gentleman and i are just shacking up .
h @-@ how &apos;s my girl ?
i &apos;m fine , abe .
settle down .
check his left hip .
he took a spill in february , hasn &apos;t been the same since .
hasn &apos;t slowed him down , though .
wait , look . d @-@ don &apos;t bother with me .
just make sure gabby &apos;s all right .
these girls know what they &apos;re doing .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m just banged up is all .
okay , so tell the nurses to monitor him
and keep him hydrated .
abe , we are going to take gabby up
and get her checked out , okay ?
okay . i @-@ i &apos;ll be right here , gabs , okay ?
will -- will you -- will you bring her back here ?
absolutely .
take a nap , you old bastard !
rachel , we just need to get you to the edge of the bed .
we get there , we can stop ,
and i know it hurts , but you got to keep your eyes open .
brody , hold her lines steady . watch her i.v.
come on . just a little further .
maybe we should stop ?
not yet .
we don &apos;t stop until we get her to the edge of the bed
or reach her point of intolerance .
point of intolerance ? how will we know ?
uh , i think that &apos;s pretty clear .
okay . we &apos;re gonna let you relax now .
you did very , very well .
let &apos;s get her cleaned up .
stop .
i got it .
i &apos;m gonna need you to take the lead
on rachel bishop &apos;s next session .
me ?
yeah , i have a full board , there &apos;s a silver flood ,
and if we miss a session , we have to stop the treatment .
well , would that really be so bad ?
do you have something you need to say ?
i ...
don &apos;t think i &apos;m comfortable with this course of treatment .
i see .
we are obviously pushing her way past
what she can handle right now , and i just feel --
edwards .
this protocol is extremely difficult .
it feels traumatic .
but you have to look at it like surgery .
surgery is traumatic .
it is so , so hard on the human body .
but in most cases , it is a patient &apos;s best chance to live ,
to be normal again , to heal .
this is rachel &apos;s chance to heal .
while she vomits .
find me when you &apos;re done .
portable x @-@ ray tech to e.r.
portable x @-@ ray tech to e.r.
excuse me , sweetheart .
oh . it &apos;s dr. sweetheart . but what can i do for you ?
well , my lady friend , gabby margraff ,
they said they were taking her for a p.t.
or something or -- or a p.p. ?
a c.t. ?
that &apos;s the ticket .
oh , boy . you know , i haven &apos;t seen her since , but i @-@ i --
and i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t want to be a bother ,
but nobody &apos;s said anything .
okay , well , hold on . let me see .
oh , yeah . okay , so according to this , she &apos;s still in c.t.
okay .
oh , okay , good , good .
great . is there anything else i can do for you ?
y @-@ you got jell @-@ o here , right ?
we do . indeed .
diaphragmatic contour is abnormal on the left .
it could be a rupture .
any abdominal strain
and she could pop her guts right into her left lung .
i think there might be a splenic hematoma also ,
but i won &apos;t know until i get in there .
any way you can do it without a scar ?
we &apos;ll do the best we can , gabby , okay ? you just sit tight .
are you okay ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
um , no , i &apos;m having flashbacks .
um ... sex flashbacks .
hey , wilson , would you step outside , please ?
okay , you were saying about the sex ?
meredith .
there was so much sex .
hot , hot sex .
everything hurts .
my back , my hip , the top of my head .
i feel like i &apos;m 80 .
oh , my god . he &apos;s an intern .
who does that ?
who screws the interns ? what kind of person does that ?
the father of my children .
oh , meredith .
okay , i didn &apos;t mean -- you know i didn &apos;t mean -- i &apos;m very sorry .
it &apos;s fine . just relax .
you think you &apos;re the first person
to have inappropriate work sex ?
we all do it all over the hospital .
i mean , we even did it in here once .
you know , i haven &apos;t thought about it .
sex .
i haven &apos;t thought about it at all since ...
that last morning --
the morning of the day he died .
i &apos;m a widow .
meredith , i &apos;m so sorry .
we don &apos;t have to talk about this .
i &apos;m -- i can &apos;t believe i even opened my stupid mouth .
do you want me to get alex or something ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
no , no .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s -- i &apos;m a widow .
i mean , like in the books and the movies .
you don &apos;t think that that happens , but it does .
it &apos;s just -- i &apos;m closed for business .
vagina city &apos;s a ghost town .
orgasm train doesn &apos;t roll through here anymore .
that part of my life is over .
you know , eventually , you &apos;ll -- when you &apos;re ready --
no . i don &apos;t want to .
it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m okay . i &apos;m good .
so , tell me about the hot , hot sex with the hot intern
and how he did you sideways
because i am widow grey , dead inside .
honey , no .
that is the saddest story i &apos;ve ever heard .
gabby .
honey , you &apos;re breaking my heart .
the orgasm train should never stop running .
i &apos;ve had an orgasm every day since i was 15 .
well , when i was 15 , i was scrapbooking with my mom .
we had nine different kinds of glitter .
now , see , that is hot to me .
orgasms are wonderful .
i had two this morning before we got on the bus .
how long has he been down ?
10 minutes .
i ran through the acls v @-@ fib protocol twice .
okay , charge to 200 .
what happened ?
he was having chest pains , so i gave him some nitro .
his b.p. bottomed out all at once .
i &apos;m worried he was on e.d. meds . we asked him .
well , was he ? clear !
what happened ?
he insisted he wasn &apos;t .
we asked him several times . we told him what could happen .
clear !
he probably lied .
why would he do that when we told him ?
people can be stubborn ,
even when it &apos;s the worst thing for them .
we told him .
time of death 12 : 19 .
what do ...
what do we do now ?
you notify the morgue .
that &apos;s it ?
that &apos;s it .
excuse me . can you help me ?
they said my father was in the accident .
can you tell me where i can find him ?
what &apos;s his name ?
edward squire . eddie .
he only answers to eddie .
uh ... okay .
i ... i should , uh -- you know , i &apos;m gonna --
let &apos;s find someone who can talk to you --
what ? why ?
is he hurt ?
he , um ... i &apos;m really sorry , but i don &apos;t think i should be --
just tell me .
he h @-@ had a heart attack .
is he -- is he all right ? can you take me to him ?
i @-@ i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t .
what do you mean you can &apos;t ? just tell me where he is .
your father &apos;s -- he ...
he passed away .
what ?
we think he lied about the medication he was taking .
what are you talking about ? he &apos;s dead ?
my father is dead ?
please just come with me .
and we can find someone who can -- - don &apos;t you touch me !
sir , sir .
he said my father was dead , and he won &apos;t tell me where he is !
i am so sorry .
he said my dad was a liar .
sir , come sit down .
i &apos;m gonna tell you everything that happened
and i will take you to your dad , okay ?
okay . please , please .
get him a chair and bring him some water .
right .
thank you . that was --
what did you do ? what did you say to him ?
dr. hunt , i -- - what the hell did you say ? !
i thought the point of a singles cruise
was to meet other singles .
exactly .
where do you think i met gabby ?
five years ago almost to the day .
really ?
absotively .
i didn &apos;t even want to go .
but my sister wouldn &apos;t get off my back .
&quot; go out , meet people .
don &apos;t just sit at home in that chair . &quot;
mm @-@ hmm . it &apos;s a nice chair ?
the best .
oh , you press a button and your feet go up .
and there &apos;s a -- there &apos;s a warmer in the seat .
and -- and -- and a little cubby for the remote .
sounds like a dream .
now i &apos;m living a new dream .
i got the chair . i got the girl .
here , but let me show you something .
oh , abe , this is all too sudden .
i barely know you . i just met you .
‭ you know , you &apos;re a wise ass .
but i -- but i like that .
it &apos;s beautiful .
gabby &apos;s beautiful .
i was gonna propose on the boat .
on the third night ,
there &apos;s this big dance in the main dining room .
huge ice sculptures and a dance band and everything .
that &apos;s where i first saw her .
the dress she was wearing .
i got so dizzy , i @-@ i just had to sit down .
i closed my eyes for a second , and when i opened them --
oh , gosh dang it .
abe , i &apos;m so sorry . duty calls .
oh , you kidding ? go .
you got more important things to do
than to listen to my stories .
i am getting the rest of that story .
i will be back a.s.a.p.
bring another jell @-@ o with you .
oh , okay . um , wait , hold on .
raspberry or lime ?
surprise me .
okay .
okay , gabby , we &apos;re going to put you under now , okay ?
i need to tell abe .
abe is downstairs .
we &apos;re gonna tell him everything that &apos;s going on .
no , i need to tell him .
he &apos;ll crap his pants if he thinks i &apos;m in trouble .
i can grab an intern to --
bless his heart , he may actually crap his pants .
he &apos;s 90 .
okay , the sats are down to 87 .
gabby , i &apos;m gonna need you to take some deep breaths .
let &apos;s get her under right now .
wilson , go down and find someone to tell abe
that gabby &apos;s in surgery and she is just fine .
i was gonna scrub in .
wilson , we have enough hands here .
go cover the pit .
you &apos;ll see him when you wake up .
listen , rachel , i know this is hard ,
but this is how you &apos;re gonna heal .
okay ?
here we go .
all right , let &apos;s try for a step , rachel .
can you give me a step ?
one step .
you give me a step , you get in that chair , we can stop .
step , the chair , we stop .
it &apos;s okay .
come on . we got you .
you can do it . it &apos;s okay .
come on . step , chair , stop .
it &apos;s okay .
i got you .
step , chair , stop .
that &apos;s enough . that &apos;s enough for now .
put her down .
dr. edwards ?
that &apos;s okay . that &apos;s good , rachel .
that &apos;s really good .
let &apos;s get you back to bed . let &apos;s get her in bed .
we haven &apos;t reached her point of intolerance .
dr. shep--
i said we &apos;re done .
okay .
legs .
you did so good .
you did really good .
really good , okay ?
want to go grab some food with me ?
i have no appetite .
shepherd &apos;s making me torture a patient
who just had brain surgery .
because she likes you .
got a funny way of showing it .
at least she let &apos;s you torture a patient .
grey and pierce just threw me out of the o.r.
they hate me .
you know , i need to be more like you .
you make the system your bitch .
if i could get an attending to look at me
the way that shepherd looks at you ...
okay , rachel , dr. edwards said
that we just need to get you into this chair ,
so that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .
all right .
okay . ready ?
wilson ?
a word , please ?
i &apos;ll be back .
dr. shepherd ,
i was just about to get rachel on her feet .
where the hell is edwards ?
there were 40 passengers on the bus .
eight of them died en route .
we &apos;ve lost six in the e.r. already ,
and many more are in surgery
or in critical care in the i.c.u.
all of these peoples &apos; families
are on their way to this hospital right now .
when they get here ,
you will be responsible for informing them
that their loved ones have died .
‭ what ?
why us ?
because after what i &apos;ve seen today ,
you clearly need the practice .
now , there are four steps to this .
location , language , body language , and leave .
we think of them as the four l &apos;s .
the first &quot; l &quot; -- location .
bring them to a quiet , comfortable place
where they won &apos;t be disturbed .
looking for the family of nestor rodriguez .
family of emma pritchett ?
june napali ?
that &apos;s me .
sir , can you come with me , please ?
just a minute .
okay , here , let me --
get your damn hands off me . i can do it .
next , language .
we used all our capabilities .
don &apos;t sugarcoat it .
don &apos;t leave anything open to interpretation .
unfortunately , we were unable to resuscitate him .
and despite our best efforts ...
you have to use the word &quot; died . &quot;
franklin is no longer with us .
grandpa left ? where &apos;d he go ?
what ?
can we go there ?
oh , i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s not what i --
are you going to take us there now ?
third , body language .
often a comforting touch can help .
a hand on the arm or on the shoulder ...
... if it feels appropriate .
grandpa &apos;s in heaven now , sweetie , with your turtle .
why are you still here ?
and finally , leave as soon as you &apos;re able .
you &apos;ve done what you came to do , so excuse yourself .
get out .
you know what ?
we &apos;re just gonna do this here .
abraham .
hey , who was monitoring this man ?
i checked him five minutes ago .
he was fine .
oh , abe .
i cannot fathom what possessed you
to abandon your pa-- my patient .
dr. shepherd -- - why are you talking ?
no one is talking to you .
you , speak .
i did not abandon her . dr. wilson is an excellent --
i didn &apos;t choose wil-- i chose you .
i gave you specific instructions .
i couldn &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m sorry . i couldn &apos;t put rachel through that .
okay , okay .
okay , okay , okay , okay , okay .
edwards , why ?
there has to be a good reason why ,
because you are too smart for this .
so , tell me .
look ...
when i was a kid ,
i was in a clinical trial for sickle cell anemia .
what ?
i was 5 .
they held me down , the nurses and the doctors ,
sticking me with needles and taking my bone marrow .
you can &apos;t imagine the pain .
and my mom would be saying over and over ,
&quot; honey , it &apos;s for your own good . it &apos;s for your own good . &quot;
i screamed and i kicked and i fought ,
and so sometimes they would strap me to the table ,
which they were right to do .
for my own good .
i was 5 .
i felt like i was being punished for something that i didn &apos;t do ,
for something that was inside of me .
and i &apos;m not gonna do that to somebody else .
i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t . i won &apos;t .
hey , hunt , i need to find a patient -- gabby margraff .
oh , she &apos;s in surgery with grey and pierce .
what do you need ?
i need to tell her
her boyfriend &apos;s dead .
he coded in the hallway .
well , how did he --
i mean , he &apos;s 90 .
could &apos;ve been a stroke or an m.i.
he just fell asleep and --
robbins , i &apos;m sorry .
we &apos;ll take care of it , okay ?
okay .
thanks .
oh , god .
what happened ?
nothing .
nothing . i &apos;m fine .
what happened ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t even know why i &apos;m crying .
he wasn &apos;t -- he wasn &apos;t even my patient .
he wasn &apos;t even a @-@ a baby .
he was 90 .
who was 90 ?
abe .
he was ... in love .
he met the love of his life when he was 85,
and he was gonna propose to her .
but he died .
i &apos;m sorry .
god , i felt like i could talk to him forever .
he made me feel like --
you know , i @-@ i never really believed
that i &apos;d find love again .
not anything real or true .
i thought that i had it and i screwed it up ,
and that was over .
then he was madly in love at 85,
and that is proof that there is --
there is more love out there .
callie might &apos;ve found hers and i can find mine ,
even if it &apos;s in 60 years .
i don &apos;t want to find a new soul mate
when i &apos;m 90 !
i met mine already and he wants a divorce .
aww , sweetie .
this is about me .
this isn &apos;t about you .
sorry .
what the hell was that ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean for you to get thrown under the bus like that .
i don &apos;t care about that .
how could you make up a story like that ?
what ?
working the system is one thing .
you want to tell a little lie to get your labs run faster , great .
i @-@ i &apos;m on board .
but that , what you did in there ,
the violin you played for dr. shepherd , you can &apos;t do that .
you can &apos;t manipulate someone like that .
you crossed a line .
don &apos;t you even have a conscience ?
well , it worked , so maybe i &apos;m better off without one .
i owe you an apology .
i ... you were helping out a friend .
i overreacted .
don &apos;t worry about it .
if i &apos;d known about edwards ,
i would &apos;ve approached the whole thing differently .
we &apos;re --
we &apos;re having this thing at the house tonight .
you two should come .
there &apos;s gonna be food , booze .
she could probably use it .
dr. shepherd .
yeah ?
stephanie &apos;s a liar .
she was never sick .
she made the whole thing up .
check the drains for blood every two hours
and page me when she &apos;s awake .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna go let abe know .
oh , okay . oh , my god . he &apos;s here .
what ? who ?
he &apos;s here .
he &apos;s here , and he &apos;s hot . oh , my god . help me .
save me . help .
dr. pierce ?
what does he want ?
what do you want ?
is that your patient , gabby margraff ?
why ?
why ?
i &apos;m supposed to notify her that her husband &apos;s died .
they -- they were not married .
they were just shacking up .
okay , but he --
he put her down as next of kin on his forms , so --
w @-@ why are you -- you are an intern .
give me that .
yeah , she &apos;s not your patient .
this isn &apos;t your job . who sent you up here ?
dr. hunt ordered me . it &apos;s a teaching thing .
i know the four l &apos;s .
you know what ?
stop talking . four l &apos;s ?
she &apos;s not even your patient . don &apos;t touch her !
don &apos;t go near her ! i &apos;ll deal with hunt !
geez , what &apos;s her problem ?
it &apos;s not like i want to be doing this .
her problem is that there are rules
and ... boundaries .
and some people think that you can just ignore all those rules ,
that you can cross those boundaries ,
that just because protocol is broken once in a whi--
no , no , no .
once !
once .
that the rules go out the window , but they don &apos;t , okay ?
her problem is that hot people should know
tthat just because a person does something that is reckless
and likes it
does not mean that they are going to
keep doing that thing , okay ?
her problem is that maybe she is tired of
scrapbooking and glitter ,
but she does not know who she is anymore ,
and everyone needs to just give her the space to figure it out
and stop asking her questions
and talking about jumbo condoms .
that ...
is meredith &apos;s problem .
understand ?
yeah , i think that -- - okay , good .
great .
dr. shepherd , i promise you --
i &apos;ve heard enough .
dr. shepherd .
grey tell you that i subbed in for her class this morning ?
and i think i did the neuro department proud .
dr. webber , as residency directory ,
you should know ...
... dr. edwards abandoned a patient this afternoon ,
and when questioned about it , she lied to my face .
a truly offensive lie about being sick as a kid ,
and i bought it .
i ...
i believed you .
she told me -- - dr. shepherd .
what do you want me to do here ?
she doesn &apos;t believe me on her own .
when she applied to this program ,
i got a call from keith wagner at saint jude &apos;s .
that sickle cell trial was a milestone in his career .
wanted to tell me how proud he was of her
and how lucky we &apos;d be to have her .
hers was one of the few success stories
to come out of that trial .
i don &apos;t understand why wilson told me you lied .
because wilson doesn &apos;t know .
because i don &apos;t talk about it anymore ,
because i &apos;m not a patient anymore .
i am a surgeon .
and when i do talk about it , i only tell people i can trust .
why didn &apos;t she just --
why didn &apos;t she just tell me to confirm the story with you ?
why did she let me -- god .
how many hours ?
how many days ?
how many surgeries have you spent with edwards ?
she &apos;s been your right hand .
so why was it so easy to question her integrity
based on the word of a doctor you hardly knew ?
god .
okay .
keep him in n.p.o.
hunt .
what the hell is going on ?
sorry ?
i have an intern who says
you sent him upstairs to tell my patient --
i did . i &apos;m giving them a crash course in breaking bad news .
they need it .
oh , a crash course .
is that how this goes ? no , it &apos;s not how this goes .
that is not how this works .
grey , this is a teaching hospital .
we teach from experience .
now , i &apos;ve given them the four l &apos;s --
the four l &apos;s are not enough .
these interns , they need a lot more .
of course they need more . that &apos;s why they have to do it .
they have to ...
experience it .
they have to live it .
and to learn it , they have to be up close and personal with it .
when you walk into a room
to tell someone that their loved one has died ,
it &apos;s more than just a list of bullet points you &apos;ve memorized .
yours is the face they will remember
for the rest of their life .
they were fine before they met you .
they picked up their children from school ,
they made dinner , and they got a call .
the police showed up at their door and brought them here
with those children to this room
so that you can give them the worst news of their entire life .
you are changing this person &apos;s life forever .
you are responsible for this moment .
for the instant that person
goes from wife to widow is you .
all you . nobody but you .
so , this person isn &apos;t an inconvenience .
they are not a box on a list to be checked off .
you are a part of their life now .
your words , your face .
so take that seriously
and recognize the importance of your role .
and respect the fact that that person &apos;s pain
is the biggest thing in the room .
you got it ?
it &apos;s not closed forever , right ?
the orgasm train will chug into the station again .
it just ...
i &apos;m just not wondering what &apos;s out there .
not feeling like i &apos;m missing anything .
i &apos;ve had that great , amazing love .
and that part &apos;s behind me now ,
and i have the kids and you guys and surgery , and ...
... i &apos;m happy .
and i never thought i would be again and i am .
and that &apos;s all i need .
so , you just need to watch those lines just like before .
good , good .
okay .
there you go .
there you go .
okay .
i know this sucks .
but we &apos;re gonna get you in that chair , okay ?
okay .
go on . keep hitting me .
keep hitting me . we &apos;re almost there .
keep hitting me . focus on that .
focus on that .
you don &apos;t stop now until we get you into this chair .
come on . you &apos;re almost there , rachel .
come on .
keep going .
i know . you &apos;re almost there .
you &apos;re almost there .
come on .
come on , rachel . just one step .
there you go .
okay . good . good .
good job , rachel . you did good .
it &apos;s okay . you &apos;re okay . you &apos;re okay .
you did it .
i need to step out for just a moment .
you did good .
you did it . good job .
that was excellent .
you saw ?
i did .
very , very well done .
thank you
i &apos;m sorry ... that i didn &apos;t believe you .
i should have .
thank you .
wait , aren &apos;t you supposed to be throwing a party right now ?
crap .
deluca .
hey , look , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
i didn &apos;t mean to cross boundaries or not do my job ,
and i clearly pissed you off and dr. grey .
so i &apos;m sorry , and if it &apos;s about last night , i &apos;m --
okay .
actually , i was -- i was coming to apologize to you .
that yelling was not about today .
it was about last night .
yeah , i knew that .
right , well , um ...
last night is not going to happen again .
it was very nice .
was better than nice .
but ... i don &apos;t do this .
hey , look , i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t do this , either , okay ?
i don &apos;t . but at the bar , you were just so --
you were so-- also .
and , uh ... you &apos;re -- you &apos;re very ...
thank you . uh , so are you .
so , uh , it was -- it was a slip .
right . i get it .
and , uh , you know what ? i agree .
okay , it -- it never happened .
deleted .
thank you .
thank you .
there are some things in life that simply can &apos;t be avoided .
no matter how uncomfortable they make us ,
and there can be rewards in
stepping outside of your comfort zone .
even when the thought of it makes us want to puke .
no , , those are for the guests .
yeah , we came early to eat the best part .
hey , where &apos;s maggie ?
she was supposed to be here with the ice
and people are already showing up .
maggie got held up at work . she said she &apos;s on her way .
the dryer finished a little bit early ,
but the tablecloth &apos;s still damp .
it &apos;s fine . just put it on the table .
it &apos;s fine .
okay .
even when we want nothing more
than to run screaming for the hills .
oh , is that jackson ?
no , it &apos;s callie .
oh , god .
i didn &apos;t know her new girlfriend was a redhead .
oh , no . i @-@ i need more liquor . i &apos;m not ready .
i &apos;ll get it .
that &apos;s why people like to say
what doesn &apos;t kill you makes you stronger .
welcome .
hi , meredith . this is penny .
the call to not get a head c.t. was a bad call .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it was my job to save him and i failed .
honey , this is meredith .
but i brought some wine .
but sometimes ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
... those people don &apos;t know what the hell they &apos;re talking about .
