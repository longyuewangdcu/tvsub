You are to escort it to Helios.
Are you mad? Across the desert?!
I will pay you handsomely.
The desert is home to thieves, murderers, cut-throats...
Perhaps your reputation as a man of courage is unfounded.
To journey to Helios is not an act of courage -
it is an act of lunacy.
A thousand now.
A thousand when you return.
When do we leave?
Hercules!
Your caravan departs at dawn.
May I ask why we're doing this?
My son, Philemon, is due to marry.
This is the bride price.
You can be rest assured it will be delivered safe and sound.
Good.
Because if you lose the cargo...
..You lose your fingers.
Every last one of you.
Every last finger.
Is that clear?
Painfully.
Are you insane?!
The desert can be lovely at this time of year.
What about the thieves, murderers and cut-throats?
All myth. The Greeks are full of them.
It'd take more than that to scare me.
What is it?
What are you doing?
More than you.
If you gave us a hand...
We are being followed.
It's a goat!
Stop, stop!
Do you know him?
He's my brother.
Three!
Luck!
Skill.
Can you give us a hand?
Four!
Four, four - knock on the door!
I'm the one the girls adore!
Hercules, we have to be on our way by dawn.
Where?
It's work. We have to go.
I'm sorry. We need the money.
I can come with you.
No.
Why not?
It's too dangerous.
He looks like he'll be more use with a sword than you.
Where are you going?
Helios.
Then I'm your man!
Excellent. That's decided then, he's coming with us.
Medusa.
Get off!
Oh, why did you have to wake me?
I was having the most glorious dream.
Medusa and I...
I really don't want to know.
Come on. The caravan leaves in less than an hour.
Unless you want usto cross the desert alone,
you need to get a move on.
Wait, wait, wait.
Where's the trunk?!
You're sleeping on it.
Where are my clothes?
You lost them - gambling. - Oh... Oh, Arcas...
I'm sure he'll give them back if you asked him nicely.
Finally, someone with a skill in this house.
Why did Pythagoras not tell us he has a gambling genius for a brother?
I don't know.
One thing's for sure, though - he wasn't pleased to see him.
I have come to seek the wisdom of Poseidon.
I have not seen you here before.
No.
You have a question for me?
I am to travel to Helios.
You wish to pray for protection?
Yes.
No.
I...
I wish to know if we will crossthe desert safely.
Your journey will take you far beyond Helios.
For you are about to embark on a voyage of the soul.
What does that mean?
That you have good reason to be concerned.
I don't understand.
The question you posed was not plain - neither is the answer.
Then tell me.
What will befall us?
You, and you alone...
..Will determine that.
I should not go.
Whatever you decide,
the time of reckoning is upon you.
Try as you may, you will not avert it.
I am grateful.
I sense a darkness in your heart.
Do you want to share it?
No.
It is my burden to live with...
..And mine to die with.
As you wish.
Hercules, help him!
Oh, yes.
Everybody, out of his way. Come on. Out of the way! Move!
Can't you see he's carrying something?!
Step to the side. Step to the side, please, sir.
To one side, one or the other.
This way.
So my father finally found someone to guard his precious cargo.
There's always someone fool enough, I suppose.
You must be the lucky bridegroom.
Indeed.
It is our humble honour to be at the service of
so praiseworthy a man as yourself.
Save your back. I'm not my father.
Have this man load it onto one of the horses.
Oh, no, this stays at my side.
As you wish.
Put this on the grain.
Excuse me?
Can you help me, please?
Yes.
Allow me.
Thank you.
It's my pleasure.
Murderer!
No, no. What're you doing?
Look! It is the mark of a murderer.
Leave him.
He works for me.
And what he may or may not have done in the past
is nothing to do with you.
It is if I'm travelling with him.
I decide who travels and who doesn't.
I'm sorry.
He's fine.
I'll look after him.
Yeah, you'd better.
When we're in the desert,
if you want to stay alive, you do as I say.
That goes for all of you.
In the desert, we are all brothers.
Otus, finish loading up, then move them on.
What was that about?
It's just the way he is.
The man had done nothing to him.
He's a murderer.
My father was killed.
Arcas was very young.
it affected him badly.
That must have been hard for you.
It was harder for him.
Because he never knew what my father was really like.
You talk to him.
I have.
Otus was a chattel,
enslaved on the Island of Samos.
That's where I grew up.
He dared to speak out, and they cut out his tongue.
One day, Otus sought his revenge.
He's paid his price.
And he's a good man,
so if your brother lays one hand on him
then he will have me to reckon with.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
I couldn't help it.
You should be careful how you judge people.
I've put all of that behind me.
You need to do the same.
Yeah.
Thanks.
They... They were to share.
What's your business in Helios?
I have family.
It's unusual to see a lady travelling alone.
I was assured that travelling with Nilas I would be safe.
A woman shouldn't be here.
Mark my words - she will bring misfortune on us all.
Here.
You're very kind.
Why don't you come and join us?
Don't listen to them.
He's scared.
We all are.
Perhaps later.
What did she say to you?
What do you mean?
Something's not right.
Look at the way she eats.
No lady eats like that.
She's hungry!
What I'd do to bathe in the fountains of Babylon.
Look like you already have.
These wretched flies!
And whose idea was this?
Even when he's asleep there's no peace.
Get some rest.
How's your brother?
You weren't expecting him to turn up.
No.
Why not?
We don't always see eye to eye.
He's young.
Perhaps.
You're not pleased to see him?
Of course I am.
I know you.
You really should get some rest.
What is it?
Pythagoras...
It's nothing.
Well, at least he's not complaining.
I'll wake you when it's your turn.
Hercules!
Get the cargo to safety!
I've been practising.
Get in the cave. Now!
Come on!
Why aren't they following us?
What is this place?
It is sacred to the Furies,
spirits who pursue murderers like them.
Don't worry. I've stayed here many times.
Thank you.
I'm glad you're all right.
I doubted you. I was wrong.
My, a man who can admit it.
I owe you my life.
And a drink.
I don't even know your name.
Baucis.
See - I was right about her.
No lady fights like that.
We should be grateful she did.
Something's not right.
You don't know that.
Trust me.
I have an instinct about these things.
These Furies,
are they Gods?
No.
They are the daughters of the night.
Spirits born of the blood of those that have been murdered.
You'd do well not to deride them.
Once summoned, they know no mercy.
For the murderer, there is no hiding place.
They will pursue him to the ends of the earth,
driven by the anger and hurt of those that have been wronged.
They sense only what is
in the heart of the man that invoked them.
He alone can recall them.
For without his true forgiveness there is no escape.
It's bats.
Nothing more.
Hear me...
..daughters of the night.
To you who feel my suffering.
To you who know the murderer of my father,
I call to you...
..that he may meet your justice.
I beg you, unloose this hatred from my heart
and wreak your revenge.
Jason.
I thought I heard a noise.
Don't let those stories get to you.
No.
No, you're right.
It's a sign from the gods.
It's a dead bird.
Some see it as a warning.
A foreshadowing of hardship and death.
This is a trick.
The thieves we encountered last night wishing to scare us.
Put the bird from your mind.
Let's pack up and move out.
I listened to what you said. You're right.
I'm going to put the past behind me.
You mean that?
I think I can now.
You all right?
Yes.
What was that?
The wind.
The desert is a strange place.
As dangerous as any thief
if you allow it into your head.
Keep together.
Oh, I hate this desert.
I thought you said it was lovely at this time of year.
Stop!
The chest! She's taken it.
Who?
The girl!
I told you.
You were right.
Oh, but you never listen to me, do you?
Yes, I do.
Well, if you had
she wouldn't have run off with the gold, would she?!
But the... The chest was...full.
I swapped it.
You're a genius.
I'm going to kiss you.
You don't have to kiss me back.
Come on.
Come on.
You saw it?
What are you doing?
It was dust.
Come on, we've got a long way to travel.
That was more than dust.
He has not been dead long.
I was set upon by thieves.
All I beg of you is a horse.
We don't have one.
She can share mine.
You've had too much sun, Philemon.
If we take her with us,
how do we know she won't do the same thing again?
It's my cargo.
I'll take that risk.
We don't know anything about her.
Baucis, is that even your true name?
But you're no lady.
Just a common thief.
I'm sorry.
She deserves nothing. Let's go.
When we set out, you said that we were to act as brothers.
And how did she treat us?
We are better than that.
If we leave her, she will die.
In fact, you may as well kill her now.
Is that what you want?
I agree with Philemon.
I say we take her with us.
Very well.
Thank you.
You saved my life.
The least I can do is return the favour.
I've told you - it's the desert, nothing more.
Who's that?
Jason.
I'm getting as nervous as you.
Come on. I'll give you a hand.
Pythagoras!
No!
No!
Help me!
Help me!
We need to get out of here.
It'll come after us.
Something happened last night and all day I've felt it.
Something is following us.
With all my heart I hope that I am wrong.
What?
These are the Furies.
But they do not strike without being summoned.
It was me.
I called them.
I asked for revenge on the man that murdered our father.
And you are from Samos.
That can mean only one thing. It was you.
It was you they were after.
You murdered him!
No! Arcas, stop!
Why?
It wasn't him.
It was me.
Please.
It was an accident.
I didn't mean to kill him.
I swear to you, it wasn't my fault.
Nilas!
We must pray for sunrise.
The daughters of the night will not attack in daylight.
Leave me.
Why?
You will die.
You said that the Furies could be called off.
You can stop this.
Never.
He killed him.
I was defending our mother.
He was drunk.
I pleaded with him, but he was hitting her.
I pushed him away, but he came at me.
He fell...
You murdered him.
I tried to help him.
But...
His head.
It was bleeding.
It was too late.
You lied to me for all this time.
You were young.
It was our mother's idea.
She did not want you to know what he was like.
You're blaming her now.
When you were older I wanted to tell you,
but I knew you would not believe me.
You're lying now to save your skin.
You know in your heart that he did not mean to kill your father.
All you need to do is show your forgiveness
and the Furies will relent.
Arcas...
You're the only one that can save him!
I believe you.
Go!
It's me they want.
If you don't go now, you won't get the chance.
No. All of you go, bring back Arcas.
It's safer than staying here.
Go with them.
This is my fate, not yours.
I won't think any less of you.
We're staying.
That food's got to last!
How long do you think we're going to live?!
Hercules!
Come on!
Arcas!
He's your brother!
Go back!
Save him!
Oh, careful! Sorry.
You're too heavy.
Oh, so it's my fault
We just saved your life.
And broke my back!
How does it feel?
It looks worse than it is. You'll be fine.
Just think of all the pies you're going to eat in Helios.
Isn't that right, Pythagoras?
This is my fault.
Help me tie this.
It's me they want.
Go! Leave me here.
This is what friends are for.
Not to die for me.
No.
To save you.
Give me your hand.
Pythagoras...
Pythagoras!
Stay here.
Don't leave me!
All right, then, leave me.
You're going to let them die?
He killed my father.
He didn't intend it.
You know your brother.
He's a good man.
People make mistakes and they should be punished.
They should also be forgiven.
Listen to her, please.
I've made my decision.
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
It's what I deserve.
No, get off me!
If we make it through tonight,
then at least we have a chance.
Of what?
Making it to the next night, and the next?
This is it, for ever till I die.
Get back!
Come on.
I had to find a way to get him back to the rocks.
I knew he would never leave me.
If you give yourself up to the Furies,
I won't get him back to Helios alone.
Are you really going to let him die?
Pythagoras!
Jason, take my hand.
I, Arcas, son of Mnesarchus,
forgive the man who murdered my father.
I call to you to cease your vengeance.
It has to come from your heart.
You have to forgive him completely.
You have to mean it!
I can't!
Please.
He is the kindest man I have ever known.
I'm sorry, Arcas.
Pythagoras!
You came back?
It was Baucis.
I didn't know you had it in you.
He's my only brother.
So if you'd had another..?
Yeah, it might've been a bit different.
We made it.
I told you I'd get you here.
Ah, food! At last!
I'll get you some water.
Thank you.
I was too quick to judge you.
You have a good heart.
So do you.
I have our father's anger.
I'm not coming back to Atlantis.
I need to make a life for myself.
You're always welcome.
So where does your bride live?
I don't know. I've never met her.
And I don't want to.
Your father chose her.
It's the way of my family.
We're going to travel on to Cyrene - take our chances there.
You sure you know what you're doing?
I think so.
So, do we know where we're delivering these riches?
Uh...Well...
Ah, you thought I was a fool for accepting Medios's offer,
but I never doubted we'd succeed
for we are men of pluck,
of mettle
and unerring courage.
You can put all that mathematics to good use by telling us
what we're each about to get paid.
Nothing.
Philemon isn't getting married.
We can't deliver the bride price.
We have to take it back to Atlantis.
Across the desert?!
I can't believe you're making me do this.
We could always leave the cargo in Helios.
But then we'd lose our fingers.
Better that than losing my life!
That's not going to happen.
You said it yourself.
"Because we are men of pluck...
.."Of mettle..." ..
"And unfailing courage."
It was unnerving...unerring courage.
I hate this desert.
I wish for you to retrieve...
..A box.
It is to be found in Campe's lair in Hades.
