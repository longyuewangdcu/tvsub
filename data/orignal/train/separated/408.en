Criminal Minds S05E15
Come on. Come on.
Sophia.
Honey.
What is mommy feeding you?
Oh nice. Give our daughter a weight complex.
Do you have a weight complex?
Yes.
Let's go inside.
"Though I walk in the midst of trouble
"You preserve my life.
"You stretch out your hand
against the anger of my foes
"And with your right hand you save me.
The word of the lord."
Thanks be to god.
The body of Christ.
Amen.
The body of Christ.
Amen.
The body of Christ.
Amen.
The blood of Christ.
Daddy can I have some of that?
Not till you're 21
or your first communion.
Mommy my doll--
Ok I'm taking this away from you.
No.
Hey ok now is not the time to play.
After communion we talk to Jesus.
I don't want to talk to Jesus!
Well try. Listen I know it's hard
but if you really try...
You' be--
Honey? Honey?
Paul! Help! Oh god!
Please! Somebody help me!
Somebody please! Please help me!
Please! Please help me!
Daddy are you all right?!
Is anyone a doctor?!
Call 911!
Oh no!
Oh please! Daddy!
Take your daughter away! Now!
Baby! Baby come here! Come here.
Come here. Come here. Come on.
Paul.
Paul.
Paul!
Paul!
Call 911!
This is captain Paul Collins.
He's the third victim in 2 weeks
in Providence Rhode island.
Captain?
Yeah he just returned home 2 weeks ago
from his fourth tour in Iraq.
He's a decorated war hero.
Was he targeted because he's in the military?
No. Just like the first two victims
he was targeted because he was convenient.
He was killed at a church during an early service.
Neck was cut open severed the carotid artery.
Bled out in a matter of moments.
Right in front of his daughter.
Murder in a church is highly symbolic.
Is there a religious agenda involved?
The detective on the case Jake Moreland
ruled that out because of the first two victims.
The first victim Mike O'donnell was found
under a sink in the men's room at a restaurant.
What kind of restaurant?
Local place white tablecloths and jug wine.
The second victim Karen Lagrassa
was killed at the laundromat.
All 3 had their throats slashed.
Aside from M.O.
the victimology's all over the place.
It's like this guy doesn't care who he's killing
Just how.
And he's doing it in public
without compunction for who sees him.
Do we have a sketch?
All anyone can agree on
is that it's a white male between 25 and 40.
Well that narrows it down to all of Providence.
Hard to fault the witnesses
given how bloody these murders must be.
What bothers me is the cooling off period
is getting shorter and shorter
with no attempt to hide who he is or what he's doing.
I mean an unsub this bold
could be suffering from a major psychotic break.
I already asked detective Moreland to pull recent releases
on prisons and mental hospitals.
We need to get to Providence ASAP.
Whether he's suffering a psychotic break or not
this could be the start of a spree.
And anyone is a potential target.
"Show me a hero
And I will write you tragedy."
F. Scott Fitzgerald.
Why is he using a knife?
Guns assure the highest number of fatalities.
If all he's interested in is quantity
He could be doing this more efficiently.
He could be training.
Spree killers often to dry runs
before they start their rampage.
Most spree killers have lost control by the time they begin.
They're always male.
And if they don't fall into the school shooter category
they're older
40s and 50s socially isolated.
The stressor's usually the dissolution
of their last social outlet.
George Hennard was inspired by James Huberty.
Between the two of them
they shot 43 people at fast food restaurants.
Well if he's practicing for his mass murder
he's definitely getting bolder about it.
And bloodier.
Right now the shock and awe of the bloodletting
seems to be what he's going for.
But soon that won't be enough.
That makes sense with regards to his fantasy life.
If he is planning something big
he'll spend his day dreaming of it
getting back at slights
both real and imagined.
Without a specific target victim
we need to concentrate on the crime scenes
and see what they tell us.
Prentiss you take the laundromat.
I'll have detective Moreland meet you there.
I'd like to take a look at the church
if you don't mind.
Good. JJ you and Morgan
interview captain Collins' wife.
She got the best look at the unsub.
See what she remembers.
Reid and I will run point from the police station.
Agent Rossi?
You must be father Kendellen.
Thank you for coming so quickly.
It's the last we can do father.
To be honest
I've been struggling to understand all this.
It's been...Trying.
I don't like to see crime tape
in front of church doors.
I can't imagine how you feel.
Ash Wednesday's next week.
These doors should never be closed to the community.
To be honest agent Hotchner
When they told me BAU was coming
I expected more than two agents.
The rest of the agents went straight to the crime scenes.
I believe there'll be information there
that may determine where the unsub will strike next.
As soon as you can I'd like you to meet
Agent Prentiss at the laundromat.
Yeah sure.
Any idea on where he may hit next?
We can double patrols.
It's honestly too early to tell.
Well your gut must be telling you something.
Well this far he's struck at a restaurant bathroom
A laundromat and a church.
He chooses his victims not out of preference
But of favorable circumstance.
With each kill he's growing bolder
Telling us he doesn't care who sees him.
So next time it'll be even more public.
Yes. Our technical analyst
is compiling a list of public events
that your department should be monitoring.
Garcia are you there?
Wired for sound and ready for action.
What have you got so far?
Well you got your "Sesame street on ice "
Your Harlem globetrotters your beatles cover bands
not to mention the dozens of college bars
and late-night hangouts frequented by the youth of America.
No event is too big or too small.
Good. Keep going.
Aye aye cap'n.
No respect even now.
I do the talking.
No comment no comment no comment.
What's the FBI's involment in the investigation
No comment.
In the murder of Captain collins?
We are strictly here just to advise the providence police department.
Is the Collins murder tied to
the other two stabbings of last week?
And when they are ready to make their statement They'll let you know.
Thank you.
They've been out there all day.
Some of my friends wanted to come by
they didn't want to be on the 6:00 news.
Your husband's a hero. Unfortunately
the circumstances of his death Has caused this to be a media circus.
Well you'd think they'd show a little--
What did I tell you Sophia?
Get away from the window.
Are we going to be on tv?
Not if I can help it.
Go in your room and play.
I'll be there in a sec.
I spent years waiting for a phone call
Or one of those letters they used to hand-deliver
to dead soldiers' wives.
They want to know if I want to bury Paul
At--at Arlington
But I don't have--
Ok.
I know you have a job to do.
Let's do this so it's done right.
That's what Paul would say.
What do you need to know?
It happened right here.
You told the police you weren't sure
when the unsub walked in?
Yes.
I don't know.
One moment he wasn't there and then he was.
All right let's walk through the mass.
You told the police that you were late.
They came in during the first reading.
You know most of your parishioners on sight?
Yes.
But not the unsub right?
No.
I don't know how I could have missed him.
You know the Collins family personally right?
Of course.
I mean Paul he grew up at this school.
Whenever he came home he made sure to come to mass.
And they sat there in the back
So as not to disturb the mass?
Yes.
Once they were settled
Could you see them?
No.
Then let yourself off the hook father.
If you couldn't see the Collins family
You couldn't see the killer.
No.
But he was definitely there by Communion?
Yes.
Not before?
I don't remember.
All right. Meg we can take a break If you need to take a break.
Hey. What is it sweetie?
I shook his hand.
When was that?
When we all say "Peace be with you" And we shake hands.
I shook his hand.
That's right.
She's right.
During the sign of the peace.
He touched my baby. He--
Oh god. He t--he touched my baby.
Meg I know this is difficult.
But I want you to try and focus.
Ok? Stay with me.
I need you to tell me what happened during communion.
We all got up.
Who got out first Paul?
Yes.
But he let me and Sophia go first.
Paul always goes last.
We--we took communion
And we--we went back and we uh...
We...
That's ok.
We're almost done.
You're doing great.
Paul was on your right.
Sophia was on your left.
What happened?
She was playing.
And after communion you pray.
I leaned down and I told her that.
So you were facing to your left away from paul
away from the killer.
You never see him coming you never see him go.
I need a break.
Of course.
I want to stay here.
Meg might recall...
More and even if she doesn't
What she's going through...
What's wrong?
This unsub isn't psychotic
and he's not gonna go on a spree.
He's too patient.
Ok but...
What is he trying to accomplish?
I don't know.
Get the stuff out...
All right I'm folding...
I don't hear you approaching.
You always talk to yourself?
Good. If these machines were on
I definitely wouldn't hear you come up behind me.
Jake Moreland providence P.D.
Emily Prentiss.
Great. Can you do that again?
Sure.
Ok.
You come in through the back door
Slash my throat walk out.
There's no cameras inside or outside of the building.
The same is true for all the crime scenes.
Which means you're smart enough
to plan for that in your attacks.
But careless enough to drop a knife 10 feet
after I cut you.
But you didn't leave any fingerprints.
No. He did that at all 3 crime scenes.
Mass murderers and spree killers
They often fetishize their weapons
But this guy discards his. Why?
He can get a new knife anytime he wants.
They carry these at army/navy stores.
It could be a scare tactic.
Hoso?
Americans typically are more terrified
by the presence of a knife than a gun.
the most of the rape victims for instance
They're more likely to scream out for help if they see a gun
whereas they'll comply if they see a blade.
So victimology and murder weapon
aren't important to this guy.
What does that leave?
What is he attacking?
The crime scene itself.
Did you see the sign outside when this place was established?
1967.
The same as the restaurant.
Second generation italian.
Everyone in the neighborhood eats there.
St. Alvina's was built at the beginning of the last century.
So each location has a history in this community.
So he wants to destroy landmarks
pieces of providence's history.
That's why the random victims.
He's making a point.
Probably the manifestation
of a deep hatred for the city.
He wants to scar the places
everybody knows and goes to.
Not quite. Take a ride with me.
We're gonna have a look at the other crime scenes.
Why?
Indulge me.
Attack an institution everybody responds.
Neighbors come out the mayor assigns extra cops.
A place of worship turns into a crime scene
You feel personally assaulted.
That's what gets him off.
The response. Public outcry.
He wants the big show.
You think he's revisiting the crime scenes?
Not just revisiting.
Reliving.
He's found a way to keep the murders he's committed
fresh because they're always on the city's mind.
"Witnesses say they didn't see it happen
Were alerted by the screams of the victim's wife and daughter."
Man alive in a church.
This guy he ain't afraid of nothin'.
Need anything?
I'm gonna grab a smoke.
Careful Connie those things'll kill ya.
Careful it's hot.
Oh good. 'cause I love my tea really warm.
Would you like some cream and sugar with your tea too?
Please.
That's how Miss Tuffet likes her tea too.
Thank you.
It's good.
But I think sophia's tea is a little bit better.
Thank you.
How many do you have?
You're too good at this not to be a mom.
One. A boy.
Sophia's first communion is supposed to be next week.
She'll do great.
Oh. Excuse me.
Hey Rossi.
We're just getting ready to deliver the profile
But I need you to do something.
I understand.
Ok uh call me when you find out more.
Bye.
Sophia mommy and Agent Jareau need some privacy ok?
Thank you for the tea.
You're welcome.
I know that tone of voice.
It's always followed by bad news.
You should know a lot of these guys need to feel powerful.
Producing a spectacle gives them that sense of pride.
I'm trying to quell that by controlling the circus outside.
Is he watching us?
Maybe.
We think he revisits his crime scenes.
It's possible the media could have brought him here.
He won't shake my daughter's hand this time if he does.
It's possible we
suggest that you' ve think of this unsub here.
Not as a slasher but as an arsonist.
Because the gratification he's getting
isn't from the physical act of murder
but from the public's reaction to it.
Arsonists draw attention to themselves
Through the fires they set.
the location they choose are highly Symbolic to them
While this unsub will never set an actual fire
He has the same psychosis as one who does.
Our unsub fits that model.
His locations have been pillars of the community.
The victims he picks aren't as important as the effect
of killing them outside of your favorite restaurant
or place of worship.
By picking locales with the highest visibility
he's creating the highest level of fear in that neighborhood
which reinforces his feeling of power.
Yeah but arsonists don't set out to hurt people.
This guy clearly does.
That's true. And this unsub
definitely falls in the category of sociopath.
His victims are there only to achieve his goal.
He doesn't have the ability to empathize with them.
To him they're just tools for him to use
no different than a can of gasoline and a match.
I'll talk to you later sweetie.
I'm just at the market right now.
All right. I love you too.
But even how he kills tells us something.
Slashing a throat is a messy visual act.
It's designed to create attention
Just like a fire.
Arsonists are often mission based.
They need make sure their first fire has burnt out
before they set another one.
Are these organic?
Yeah.
You know I think I have a fresher bunch of those
back in the truck. Holdn one second.
They're also highly disciplined and focused.
If conditions aren't right to set a fire
or in this case slash a throat they'll move on.
You know I'm sorry I don't.
Which actually makes this your lucky day.
If you want to get something else
These hydrangeas are perfect.
They have to go home with somebody.
I'll give them to you for half.
They're beautiful. Absolutely I'll take them.
Blue for your eyes. How about that?
In addition to his need to kill
he has self-control.
He has a short cooling off period
because he's enjoying what he's doing.
This in turn feeds his ego
and keeps him covering his tracks.
This makes him even more dangerous.
If he gets frustrated encounters too many obstacles
or suffers a blow to his narcissistic ego
he could go on an all-out rampage.
Focus on men between jobs
instead of working consistently
he is hunting at his next location.
And he's revisiting his old scenes.
We recommend you--
Yeah.
The news crews are leaving the Collins' house.
He's killed again.
Yeah. Farmers market at third and Shelby.
The press are already on their way.
We could use that.
It'll feed his ego.
He'll want to stay and watch.
Ladies and gentlemen when you get to the crime scene
we need you to canvass the crowd.
Pay particular attention to onlookers who might be
more interested in the scene itself than the victim.
And get photographs of everyone.
Excuse me.
JJ I need you there.
No Hotch I-- I can't leave.
JJ you're there to control the media.
They've left to cover the crime scene
which may distract the unsub.
We can catch him but I need you on top of the press
making sure they're focused on our goals and not the unsub's.
JJ.
Yeah. I'm on my way.
I'm so sorry.
It's ok. I know that tone of voice too.
Somebody died?
Oh my god.
What happened?
I bet it was that stabber.
Stabber? What stabber?
You know the guy who's been cutting
people's throats open around town.
Right. Him.
Come with me sir.
What?
What?
Come on.
Wait what?
Let's go.
Providence police.
Go ahead Emily.
Hey Rossi I got a trail of blood here
but I haven't found the knife yet.
He ran away.
See where it ends.
Got it.
We can't run this locally.
Run? It's ran it's gone.
CNN's leading with this in 3 hours.
Minimize his impact.
Do not give him a name.
It'll just encourage him to kill more.
Am I making this deal for full access?
Of course.
Just attribute the good work to the Providence p.D.
and leave us out of it.
He was just a nice guy who worked here.
I'd seen him here before but never bought anything from him.
What do you remember about the attack?
I asked if his flowers were organic.
I turned away and the next thing I know
I felt something warm. It was blood.
Did you get a look at the guy with the knife?
The first person I saw was a guy screaming for help
and he was trying to stop the bleeding.
A bunch of people ran over there trying to help
and I think I just stood there screaming.
Back up for a second.
Who was shouting?
I don't know some guy.
When I turned around he was holding the poor man up
trying to get someone to notice.
This guy must have got a lot of blood on him yeah?
Yeah sure I guess.
All right thank you for your time.
Officer.
Go ahead Emily.
I found out where that blood trail ended.
And?
The unsub changed his clothes.
He left his blood-soaked ones here in the trash.
He's avoided getting blood on himself up to now.
What changed?
I don't know but whatever his reason
he came prepared.
He knew he would be bloody this time.
I'll get back to you.
What do you got Morgan?
A witness says the first responder a citizen
cried out for help maybe 2 seconds after the stabbing.
He was the unsub.
I think so.
He's not content with revisiting the crime scene anymore
he needs to be part of them.
Detective!
Yeah.
Establish a perimeter around the market.
Put your men no more an 20 feet apart.
Every cop needs to be in sight of one another.
Whoa wait a minute. What?
The unsub is still here.
Are you sure?
Start by separating the men from the women.
We found discarded clothes.
That's how we find him. We match by body type.
All right I'm on it. Gardella come on.
Copy that.
Connor is that you?
Hey Liddy.
What are you going?
I gotta get back to the diner.
Well you're gonna be late.
We gotta detain everyone inside here.
Oh come on. How many hamburgers have let slide?
Just following orders buddy. Let's go.
You gotta explain to Sal when I'm late.
Yeah yeah your customers won't starve.
Those gotta be on the board too?
What's the next great bit of advice from the FBI huh?
Take it easy Gardella. This ain't the time or the place.
If we hadn't listened to them
Liddy and I would be havg our morning cup of coffee.
We profiled that he was mission oriented
And this kill doesn't fit that pattern.
The murder of officer Liddy is a significant departure
even for someone as unpredictable as this unsub.
This was a murder of self-preservation just to get away.
This location is not his M.O.
Secluded with no audience stabbing not cutting.
So?
So he's out prowling the streets right now
Looking for another victim so the city will pay atteion to him.
You've been handed a list of locations
that we think might be of particular interest to the unsub.
We're asking you to double and
even triple your surveillance in these areas.
Keep your wits about you guys.
Detective we'd like to speak to you.
Sure.
That's it fellas. Thank you.
Detective the story has become about officer Liddy.
We need to get the attention back on the unsub
Or we're afraid that he may lash out.
Up till now the unsub has been disciplined enough
to avoid killing if the circumstances weren't right.
Like an arsonist who won't set a fire if there's someone there
to see him leaving while smoke is billowing out the windows.
What if we say that one of the buildings didn't burn?
How would the unsub react to that?
He'd be compelled to come back and finish the job.
Then we pick one of the previous locations
show that the community has rallied around it
That they are not afraid of him.
So we need to find a location
With the greatest symbolism up to this point.
That's easy.
And we use the city's fallen hero
As inspiration.
Should we get the chief of police or the mayor
to make a statement? It could help with inspiring people.
We've got something better.
Captain Collins' widow.
I--I cannot ask her to do that.
She's highly visible and she's someone
with whom the entire city can sympathize.
When she tells the city not to be afraid to come back to church
The unsub can't ignore that.
And what happens if this draws the unsub to Meg?
We keep her with us.
We'll take the bastard down.
You want me to read this
In front of cameras?
Yes.
Will my husband's killer be there?
Most likely he'll watch it on tv.
You'll have police protection around you at all times.
No.
I won't do it.
Meg please.
We need you.
You represent Paul's memory.
I represent Sophia.
Paul's given enough.
So have I.
Yes sir.
No I understand. Thank you.
That was the mayor. He won't sign off on a press conference
at St. Alvina.
And JJ couldn't make any headway with Meg Collins.
How long has it been since officer Liddy was stabbed?
16 hours.
Well if the unsub was going to go out on a spree
He would have done it by now. Why hasn't he?
He killed a cop. He's laying low.
May be. But we've profiled this guy like an arsonist.
It's the aftermath that matters not the act.
You think he's feeding off
the grief of the police department instead?
If so then he's found something new to get off on.
Detective.
Hold on a second. Yeah?
I need a list of establishments
where your officers socialize--
Bars restaunts pool halls everything you've got.
Sure right. Eddie let me get back to you.
Another round guys?
Yeah. We're off the clock anyways.
One more for Liddy boys.
Here's to a great cop.
We'll get this bastard for you Joe.
Yeah the fbi gonna help you do that?
We don't need a profile
to know the kind of guy we're dealing with.
A coward.
He stabs a cop in the dark
And runs away like a vermin.
Gutless.
No kiddin'.
Comrades I have amassed employment records for police hangouts.
What do you want me took for?
White males 25 to 30.
I'm gonna need more than that.
Arsonists typically have a stronger relationship
with their mothers than their fathers
So let's look for single-mother households
with a history of abuse bad divorce or paternal violence.
Manifestations in the son too Garcia
like juvenile arrests heavy crimes
a significant drop in grades.
Thank you boys. That will do.
Oh this looks like something.
What do you have?
Connor O'brien.
His dad went to prison for--
Oh lordy--not only setting mom's apartment on fire
but making it look like it was an accident
so he could collect on the insurance.
Rned his kid's mother for a few bucks?
Yeah. And then Connor testified.
And his father was trailed.
He was 10.
Where's O'brien now?
He works at the quality cafe.
Guys it's across the street.
Thanks Garcia.
Where's Connor O'brien? Fbi.
Connie? He just stepped out about 10 minutes ago.
Did you see which way he went?
He just went out to grab a smoke. Why
Garcia I need O'brien's home address.
What are you guys doing here?
We were done with our shifts.
We poured one out for Liddy.
Did you talk to him about the recent mders?
Of course. We said we'd catch the coward.
You disparaged him.
1121 admiral apartment 16.
It's the other side of town.
Dave you and Morgan meet Prentiss and S.W.A.T. On site.
Connor O'Brien!
Clear!
He's not coming back here.
He's gonna make his last stand.
He's still gonna need to know he's foremost on everyone's mind.
Guys!
It looks like he's got every article that was printed
About his mom's death.
He has the prayer card from her funeral.
Birthday cards.
Look all of them signed by his mom not by his father.
Look at this.
That's a lot of hate.
His old man is already in prison. He can't attack him.
So he goes after the places that remind him of his father.
The only way he can get through to his dad is with violence.
William O'Brien aka Billy Os.
Was a connected guy who specialized in turning faulty wiring
into a 3-alarm fire.
Because of Connor's testimony
He was given a life sentence
for the murder of his wife
But it was recently reduced
to the possibility of parole in 5 years.
When was the sentence reduced?
One month ago.
Just before the murders started.
There's our stressor.
Why would he do this to get
back at his father if he's already in jail?
Somebody's gotta pay.
He's a tough guy now.
Hey wake up.
Wake up!
Your mother's dead.
Time to go.
But dad you said I could--
I said let's go!
It's ok honey.
Just give me one more minute we'll be out of here.
Yeah thanks Eddie.
Damn it.
Where?
Library about a mile from here.
Mother was found next to her crying baby.
Is the baby ok?
Not a scratch but they haven't found the knife yet.
It's his memento now. He won't stop until he's killed
as many people as possible.
We have to go to our original plan--
create an event he can't resist coming to.
He has to believe he was unsuccessful.
If he won't go back to his apartment and I don't think
he's gonna revisit the crime scenes.
The mother from the library? She's already gone.
She bled out at the scene. The emts stopped working on her.
Tell them to keep trying to resuscitate her.
But she's dead.
Yeah but the unsub doesn't know that.
Tell the press she made it she's hanging on for dear life.
And we organize a candlelight vigil for her tonight.
If he's mission oriented and he thinks she's still alive
he'll have to come back for her.
And we'll be there.
Let the husband know what's going on
so he's aware.
Have the press there. Tell them to go live
and to keep the focus on us as much as they can.
Mrs. Collins.
The woman who was just attacked...
She was a mother?
Yes.
What can I do to help?
We are live at the latest crime scene
where the FBI is facilitating what appears to be...
Officer! Move this crowd to that corner
and pin them behind the police barricades.
We've got a female about 30
Her throat's been slashed she's hanging on.
There's a vascular surgeon standing by at the hospital.
Yeah one two is your change.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
A pack of smokes. Uh c-could you turn that up?
...Crime scene where the FBI is facilitating
what appears to be a rescue attempt of the most recent victim.
They are rushing her into an ambulance now.
Make some room please!
Right this way guys.
How's she doing?
We've got her stabilized sir.
They're coming through. Please clear it out.
Can we clear a path please.
Officers I want a 5-car escort for the ambulance
to the hospital.
As you can see she is still alive
and being rushed to the hospital now.
Looks like she's ok.
No no that's im-- that's not possible.
As many of you know
My husband Captain Paul Collins
was murdered this past Sunday.
The support I have received has been inspiring.
Which is why I'm asking everyone
to support the latest victim Julia Vecchia
who is fighting for her life right now
at St. Frazier's hospital.
It's that wife of the soldier who got killed.
On behalf of my husband
we are asking you to come together
at st. Frazier's to hold a candlelight vigil tonight.
Please help restore this great city...
Look at her. Kid's got a lot of heart.
Thank you.
You think this'll work?
It should. We've shifted the public's focus
from connor to his victim.
That should make him angry enough to show up
And try to do something about it.
I got a twine of our suspect.
Connor O'Brien?
Roll in now. Go go.
Put your hands where I can see them and get down on the ground!
Hey! FBI!
Stop right there!
Stop! Moving! Stop fighting!
Stop fighting!
Stop!
That's enough! It's over! That's enough!
She's dead! There no possible way she could have survived!
Connor O'Brien you're under arrest.
We know why you came down here.
Do you?
I had to make sure.
She--she's dead right?
What are you smiling at? You're going to jail.
In jail they treat cop killers like kings.
First you gotta see how we treat 'em at the station.
Get him out of here.
It's hard to believe that guy was so starved for attention
that he murdered all those people just to one-up s father.
I spoke with detective Moreland about Connor's father Billy OS.
He said the older police knew to give him a wide berth.
He didn't say much but when he did...
people listened.
The adult version of a bully.
There are lots of ways that sons defeat their fathers.
I just keep getting Ph.D.s.
Does the son of a sociopath ever really have a chance?
You know O'Brien committed his
crimes in the same jurisdiction as his father.
It's only a matter of time before he's put in the same prison.
William Shakespeare wrote
"When a father gives to his son both laugh.
"When a son gives to his father
Both cry."
Hey dad.
Well well well.
