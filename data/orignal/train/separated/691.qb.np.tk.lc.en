my father was an innocent man ,
destroyed by powerful people .
the graysons are behind this , and they &apos;re gonna pay .
i &apos;ve dedicated my life to avenging his death .
eventually , someone &apos;s gonna find you out .
and i won &apos;t stop until they &apos;ve all paid the price .
you questioned the type of man i am
in print ... and to my face .
i &apos;m gonna stay at the south fork again .
you tried to humiliate me .
go out there and tell everyone that this is my gallery now .
because you intrigue me .
i &apos;ve been misdiagnosed .
i do not suffer from huntington &apos;s disease .
what ?
margaux . are you two ...
charlotte set us up .
does jack know who you really are ?
i &apos;m sorry .
somebody tried to kill you by tampering with your brakes .
jack porter wants you dead .
when on a mission of revenge ,
one must maintain total control ...
over risks , emotions ,
and one &apos;s enemies .
the single greatest threat to success ...
is losing control of your allies .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
someone &apos;s trying to kill conrad ,
and i need to figure out who it is .
brake fluid stains metal . if i could just find--
it &apos;s not here , emily . don &apos;t you think i &apos;ve looked ?
i can &apos;t let this go , aiden .
whoever &apos;s behind this could jeopardize everything .
or your wedding , you mean .
there won &apos;t be one if you &apos;re not careful .
daniel and i had a fight . so what ? i &apos;ll deal with it .
i think you may be overestimating your influence on him .
don &apos;t tell me how to do my job .
then stop doing mine .
let me find out who tried to kill conrad .
fine .
but please tell me that
conrad has no idea someone cut the brakes .
i can &apos;t have him drawing his own conclusions .
no , he has no idea .
good .
i &apos;ll leave you to it .
here you go , big guy .
you &apos;re all clean ...
well , for the next three minutes anyways .
jack , are you here ?
oh , i remember those .
charlotte said it was okay to come up .
of course . come on in .
it &apos;s good to see you .
and this must be le petit carl , huh ?
oh , yeah .
he &apos;s apparently already the ladies &apos; man .
can i ?
yeah , please .
hello .
have you been ?
very busy .
my first issue of &quot; voulez &quot; comes out tomorrow .
oh , that &apos;s great . your crew &apos;s been in here .
sounds like you &apos;ve been working them to the bone .
yeah , to great result .
we &apos;re having a big celebration at the office .
i would love for you to be my guest .
oh , i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t know .
no , you must come .
even my father is gracing us with his presence .
that &apos;s a big deal , right ?
and he &apos;d be the first one to tell you .
which is why i want someone next to me
who doesn &apos;t care .
look , it sounds like fun , but i ...
i don &apos;t really get along with your business partner
or his family .
well , you can stay home and hide from the graysons ,
or you can come out and have a marvelous time with me .
it &apos;s your choice .
i &apos;ll get a sitter .
then it &apos;s a date .
bye @-@ bye , carl . a bientot .
well , i have many enemies .
a man does not reach my position
without amassing his fair share .
but currently jack porter is my primary concern amongst them .
i believe that he is responsible for the sabotage that nearly ended my life .
what &apos;s he after ?
revenge-- misguided as it may be .
i &apos;ll do what i can .
but when you demoed the car , you destroyed my best lead .
this won &apos;t be easy .
well , nothing of value ever is .
do you mind explaining why you &apos;ve hired an investigator
when i was the one who discovered the truth about your &quot; accident &quot; ?
&apos;cause that man is recommended by people i trust .
and the same cannot be said of you ,
considering our uniquely complicated history .
besides you seem satisfied to serve as my wife &apos;s valet .
if i need someone to hold my handbag ,
i &apos;ll be sure to give you a call .
you know , you may not trust me ,
but you would be wise to work with me
because i can give you what you want .
oh , and what is that ?
your daughter .
i don &apos;t need an investigator
to see that charlotte &apos;s visits here have become nonexistent ,
and that it coincides with her moving in with porter .
he &apos;s ... obviously poisoned her against you .
well , you &apos;re observant , mr. mathis , i &apos;ll give you that .
and you feel that exposing the truth
about porter will give her the dose of perspective
to win her back .
you believe you can help me with that ?
i can guarantee it .
ooh , you sound like a man who has skin in the game .
i &apos;m just somebody who wants to prove his worth
to the master of the house .
observant and ambitious .
well , i &apos;ll tell you what .
i &apos;ll call off my man and place you in his stead permanently ,
if you can ensure that jack porter
spends the rest of his life rotting in a prison cell .
nothing would please me more .
judging by your reaction , i &apos;m guessing
you were expecting someone else .
yeah , actually , our mother .
oh . she just can &apos;t stop interfering .
with what ?
in this case , us .
she asked me to stop by before work
saying she had something for me , but obviously
she &apos;s attempting to manufacture a détente between us .
i didn &apos;t realize i had a problem with you .
oh , you didn &apos;t , but it &apos;s no secret
i have one with you , which--truth be told--
wasn &apos;t fair , not to mention misdirected .
so i &apos;m sorry about that .
then i was successful .
puppet master herself .
you know , it really is a compulsion with you .
oh , who can blame a mother for wanting to put her house in order ?
i got a magazine to launch . so are we done ,
or is there another reason you wanted me to come by ?
good morning .
wow , right .
daniel , you &apos;ve been staying at the south fork ,
so you wouldn &apos;t know .
emily is taking charlotte and myself
shopping for wedding clothes today .
of course , patrick and i aren &apos;t the only
peace treaty you &apos;ve negotiated .
daniel , i want nothing more than to move past
the unfortunate incident at nolan &apos;s party .
okay , well , i gotta run .
when i get back from the city , can we talk ?
i don &apos;t know when i &apos;ll be done tonight .
but if there &apos;s time , then sure .
patrick , my office is gonna need
some new art for the lobby .
i know a guy . yeah ?
why don &apos;t you walk me to my car ?
you ladies have fun .
emily , i am so sorry .
i &apos;m sure you can understand how it never occurred to me
that seeing your intended would cause stress .
i hope the price of the dress doesn &apos;t do the same for you .
remember , they &apos;re my treat .
of course .
but i do hope today &apos;s wedding excursion
doesn &apos;t prove to be an exercise in futility .
it would be such a shame ... again . hmm .
hmm . so i think that you &apos;ll agree
that this is the far more beautiful selection ,
and this bracelet should go very nicely with it .
thank you so much for your suggestion , emily ,
but i feel as if i &apos;ve seen the dress you chose a million times .
well , you know best , victoria .
charlotte , is that what you &apos;re wearing to the wedding ?
emily said i could choose anything .
we don &apos;t have to go the traditional route ,
seeing as she &apos;s the only one in my bridal party .
oh , how forward @-@ thinking .
i hope daniel doesn &apos;t misinterpret your laissez @-@ faire attitude .
oh , he knows i &apos;m just as excited as he is .
and we share that enthusiasm .
i simply cannot wait to see the dress you chose
for the rehearsal dinner .
would you be a dear and take ms. thorne back
so that she can model it for us ?
with pleasure .
here . i &apos;ll take that .
right this way .
charlotte , you look beautiful .
clearly , you hate the dress .
oh , i &apos;m not terribly worried about it ,
as it will be the last time i ever see it .
your brother needs our protection .
he may be smart and ambitious ,
but he &apos;s far too trusting of women .
you say that about everyone he gets serious with .
remember sara ?
well , your brother ensured that i would never forget her ,
but at least that cocktail waitress is preferable to emily .
and what has emily done that &apos;s so wrong ?
you don &apos;t know ?
she broke their first engagement and daniel &apos;s heart
over a tryst with your current landlord .
jack ?
mm @-@ hmm .
oh , my god .
mm @-@ hmm .
you &apos;re digging to see if she truly loves daniel .
well , it &apos;s certainly not for her fashion sense .
you know , i did think it was weird
she was at the stowaway last night
instead of trying to fix things with him .
what was jack &apos;s attitude toward her ?
i &apos;m pretty sure he &apos;s into margaux right now .
i was wondering if i was ever gonna see you again .
uh , well ... i &apos;ve been meaning to call .
but you forgot what those little numbers
on your phone were for , right ?
phones still have numbers ?
so is , uh ... mama bear in the cave ?
why ? are you looking to pick another fight with her ?
not at all .
no , i just , uh ...
wondered if we had some privacy ...
to talk ...
about what happened the other night .
well , i don &apos;t have any secrets from my mother .
she knows that i &apos;m gay .
the question is how did you know ?
oh , well , let &apos;s just say i have , uh ...
well @-@ calibrated gaydar . and , uh ...
leave it at that .
you &apos;re a liar .
wh--excuse me ?
did you really think i wouldn &apos;t find out
you went to my ex @-@ wife ?
you paid her 20 grand to get dirt on me ?
are you out of your mind ?
who does that ?
uh ... yeah , okay .
i know this looks , uh , bad on the surface , but--
i don &apos;t want someone digging through my life .
patrick , i , uh ...
you got a question for me , you can ask me .
don &apos;t go behind my back .
i don &apos;t play games ,
but clearly , you do .
uh , the second &quot; voulez &quot; backdrop should go here .
and i want lights here , here , and over the bar .
you got it .
nothing fluorescent .
of course .
listen , i don &apos;t know how things are done in france ,
but you do have an assistant to handle this stuff .
uh , clear this wall , please .
only i know what my father likes ...
and more importantly , what he does not .
i thought you didn &apos;t care what your father thought .
it is better for both of us if he &apos;s happy tomorrow night .
he will be when he sees this .
hot off the press .
well , i see this and only think
of how much more work we have to do--
like our wedding issue--
especially since i don &apos;t know what to write .
i mean , i have plenty on you and your family .
but emily ? not so much .
well , she &apos;s had a tough life .
you wouldn &apos;t know it by looking at her .
her parents died when she was very young
in a car accident .
she was the only survivor .
i know , but we need more for her profile .
even just a picture of her family , perhaps ,
would give me something to go on .
i ... i mean , i @-@ i don &apos;t have one .
she doesn &apos;t keep any around the house .
what , you &apos;ve never seen her parents ?
no .
well , it would seem then we both have
much to learn about your elusive fiance .
thank you .
did , uh , charlotte come in with you ?
no , conrad , she didn &apos;t .
you know , not so long ago
she was worshipping at your feet .
now she wouldn &apos;t even come visit you
when you were at the hospital .
and i have to wonder what you did
to create such a profound rift .
well , charlotte believes
she &apos;s been made fully aware of the truth
about the bombing of grayson global ,
and my role in what transpired .
now she &apos;s convinced that i &apos;m solely responsible
for declan porter &apos;s death .
how did that happen ?
i &apos;m sure it was jack .
he turned her against me .
now she blames me for the loss of her unborn child .
you know , when i believed i was dying ,
i was fighting the clock to win her back .
now i &apos;m praying that time will heal those wounds .
well , when a woman loses the man she loves ,
who happens to be the father of her child ,
she feels a pain that is unimaginable ...
one she can neither forget , nor forgive .
see it as you must , but i will not lose my daughter
to jack porter . and in a happy turn of events ,
i have your british lackey &apos;s guarantee on that .
sallie , hey , thanks for watching carl .
i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll pick him up in a half an hour . okay ?
all right , bye .
looking for this ?
who are you ?
what are you doing in my house ?
conrad grayson sent me .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m not here to hurt you .
what do you want ?
it &apos;s not what i want that matters , is it ?
it &apos;s what grayson wants , and that is you gone .
i don &apos;t care what he wants .
well , you need to start ...
now .
you know i &apos;ve heard a lot about you ...
mostly that you &apos;re a good man .
but the problem is you &apos;ve made an enemy with a very bad one .
you think i don &apos;t know that ...
calm down .
after everything he &apos;s taken from me ?
i assure you , i had nothing to do
with what happened to your family .
you want a medal ? you work for him !
the reason i took this assignment
was to give you time .
for what ?
to run .
conrad grayson is not going to rest
until you are taken care of .
so i &apos;m giving you a chance .
and if you want any kind of future with your son ,
you leave town now . you don &apos;t come back ,
and you don &apos;t contact anybody here ever again .
oh , submersible crate and ... homing beacon .
i think it was &quot; town &amp; country &quot; said ,
&quot; they were the must @-@ haves for the hamptons this season . &quot;
i need you to hold on to these until the wedding .
after daniel &apos;s launch party tonight ,
i plan on having him back for good .
operation &quot; recommit . &quot;
well , that explains the dress shopping with victoria .
yeah , your little excursion made the front page of &quot; t.m.i. &quot;
though , honestly , i &apos;m stunned that vicky agreed to go ,
especially after you told the world she was more ,
mm ... bargain basement than haute couture .
well , she &apos;s obviously up to something .
have you figured out who &apos;s trying to off her hubby ?
not yet , but aiden &apos;s taken over the investigation .
oh ... good .
&apos;cause everything went just pithy last year
when he was on the case .
my priority is to keep the wedding on track .
i know things went south before ...
yeah , they didn &apos;t just go south , ems .
they went arctic . and you know what ?
frankly , i &apos;m kinda tired of the way that this stuff
is constantly screwing up our lives ,
especially ... stuff you want the most .
wait . where is this coming from ?
did something happen ?
no .
i just ...
i just want this to go smoothly ,
and ... for this to end .
it will . i have it all handled .
see ... you say that , ems , but , uh ,
the more strings you pull ,
the easier it is to get strangled .
then again , i &apos;m just a self @-@ made billionaire
with a 170 iq , so ... what do i know , right ?
i understand that conrad &apos;s using you
to deal with jack porter ,
which poses a problem ...
because jack is vital to achieving my goal .
why , you need someone to mix you a drink ?
i will not give up a scintilla
of emotional leverage i have over emily .
now much like you ,
jack seems to have the ability to unnerve her .
i &apos;ve learned that her connection to him
is still very much alive .
so while you may represent her past ,
jack plays a significant role in her present .
well , your husband has other plans for him .
oh , well , that &apos;s not my concern ...
nor should it be yours .
you moved here because you said you wanted
to help me stop this marriage .
i suggest that you determine which master
is in your best interest to serve .
so what would you have me do ?
emily .
victoria , what a surprise .
well , i needed to speak to you .
well , can it wait ?
we wouldn &apos;t want to be late for daniel &apos;s party .
i &apos;m afraid it can &apos;t .
this involves the unfortunate accident
that took father paul &apos;s life .
the tragedy has become even more unsettling
in the light of new evidence .
evidence of what ?
sabotage .
conrad is convinced that jack porter is responsible ,
and i fear that he may be right ,
given his actions on the night of the election .
those were extraordinary circumstances . you know that .
i don &apos;t disagree . he may well be innocent .
but there is no persuading conrad .
why are you telling me this ?
charlotte mentioned that you still frequent his bar .
and i would hate for you to get caught
in conrad &apos;s line of fire ,
especially so close to the wedding .
well , thank you for your concern .
you &apos;re about to be family now .
i &apos;ll see you at daniel &apos;s party .
i know this smile-- it is pride .
yeah , i &apos;m not gonna lie . it feels pretty damn good .
the best part is the words &quot; grayson &quot; and &quot; global &quot;
aren &apos;t anywhere in sight .
i &apos;ve grown up in publishing , and you &apos;re a natural ...
both the good and the bad .
ah , you &apos;re still holding a grudge
about the move i pulled with your father ?
no . no , but try another one like that ,
and you will find that i , too , have claws .
okay .
wow ! look who left his blue blazer in the closet .
conrad ...
you look dashing .
margaux .
well , it is a high @-@ fashion party with a european flair .
so i thought i &apos;d dress the part .
speaking of fashion hounds , where is your father , pascal ?
alas , he could not come .
he broke his leg , and they would not let him fly .
but he sends his best .
then i send mine in return .
congratulations to you both .
i couldn &apos;t be happier .
thank you .
would you like some wine , sir ?
thank you .
i got it .
do you want to sit down ?
ah , good idea .
look at you . you look fantastic .
the party is awesome . the offices look awesome .
i &apos;m so proud of you , daniel .
you want to tell me what &apos;s going on with you and dad ?
i definitely do not .
besides , tonight &apos;s about you .
let &apos;s just have a good time and forget our troubles .
all right . let &apos;s get you a drink .
why is the bar closed ?
cause i didn &apos;t want anyone coming through this door .
what &apos;s going on ?
i can &apos;t talk right now , emily .
conrad knows about the brakes ,
and he thinks you &apos;re responsible .
i don &apos;t know how it happened ,
but i had to tell you right away .
conrad already sent someone .
he was here waiting for me when i got home .
so until you keep your promise ,
and you end this ,
i gotta get carl the hell out of here .
i gotta take him somewhere safe .
and when you &apos;re done , i can go get him .
but i &apos;m coming back .
cause i &apos;m not leaving any of this to chance .
and that is the only option that you left me .
jack , i am so sorry .
don &apos;t waste time being sorry .
just finish whatever it is you &apos;re gonna do .
cause the next guy that conrad sends
might not give me the chance to run .
wait . what guy ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve never seen him before .
he &apos;s tall , short hair , british .
you know him ?
aiden mathis .
he works for me .
who are you ?
jack--
no , no , i keep telling myself
i don &apos;t want to know .
like , maybe i &apos;m trying to protect myself or you ,
but the more i see , the more i @-@ i wonder what happened
to that little girl that i met on the beach .
what happened to her ?
she lost everything , jack . how do you not get that ?
i know about loss , emily . believe me .
but that doesn &apos;t explain what you &apos;re doing--
not to me , and it sure as hell doesn &apos;t explain
why somebody who supposedly works for you
broke into my house .
look , i will handle this .
and how are you gonna do that , emily ?
you can &apos;t even trust the people you have on your side .
champagne for you .
club soda for my underage sister .
i miss europe .
and i &apos;m missing your fiancee , daniel .
i am aware she &apos;s not here .
well , i wonder where she can be .
you know what ? fine .
emily and i are having problems .
but i &apos;m going to deal with them myself , okay ?
don &apos;t do this on his big night .
i simply want him to understand
that the people who support him are right here .
nothing &apos;s ever simple with you .
aiden , call me the second you get this .
have you lost your mind ?
have you ?
you threatened jack ? tell him to run ?
he &apos;s in the way .
of who ?
of you . look at you--
running to him at the first sign of trouble .
do you love him ?
oh , are you seriously asking me that ?
i need to know , emily .
because i didn &apos;t just come here to take down the graysons .
i came because of you .
but i will not be made a fool of .
i have cost jack enough .
i will not let anything happen to him again--
he--he doesn &apos;t belong here , emily .
not now that conrad knows somebody tried to kill him .
and how does he know that , huh ?
i had to tell conrad about the brakes ,
because he was about to cut me loose .
and you need me inside for your next part of the plan .
or are you so blinded by emotion ,
you &apos;ve forgotten about that , too ?
and what about jack ?
did you lead conrad to him , too ?
we &apos;re staying ahead of the investigation .
don &apos;t pretend that you are acting out of anything
other than jealousy . you willfully endangered jack .
that is the truth , aiden .
the truth ?
you want the truth ? okay , well , here &apos;s the truth .
you &apos;ve just played right into victoria &apos;s hands .
yeah , she had me follow you .
she fed you that information ,
hoping that you &apos;d run straight to jack .
instead of standing by daniel as you &apos;re supposed to .
i prayed it wasn &apos;t true ,
but i had to see it with my own eyes ,
and i guess now i have my answer .
then i guess we both failed .
because jack isn &apos;t going anywhere ,
he &apos;s staying behind to make sure i end this like i promised .
yeah , well , then he &apos;s a fool .
he &apos;s a man of principle , which is what i thought you were .
i will get daniel back , aiden ,
but you better clear jack &apos;s name .
for the last time , i am trusting you .
don &apos;t make me regret it .
you &apos;re in good company .
da vinci was obsessed with water , too .
he called it &quot; the driving force of all nature . &quot;
he also said it was full of paradox ,
that it could be anything--
strong , sweet ...
deadly ...
kind of like people .
although he forgot about deceitful .
yeah .
about that ...
patrick , i &apos;ve always been wired a little differently .
you know , which is great when it comes
to inventing gadgets and ...
not so great when it comes to dealing with people .
no , i get that .
i &apos;ve been here for six months . i still feel like an outsider .
what i don &apos;t get is why you did what you did .
it &apos;s a defense .
people have been ... mean ,
dishonest ... making it hard for me to trust them .
so what , you just thought you &apos;d stay ahead of the curve ?
no .
i screwed up ...
with you .
i &apos;m sorry .
look , nolan , i gotta be honest , you freak me out .
look , things are complicated enough ,
thanks to the two women in our lives .
believe me , i know .
but if you want to give me another chance ,
come find me .
i thought ... i recognized the telltale signs of a woman masking disappointment .
does this have anything to do with your father &apos;s absence ?
am i that obvious ?
i have known pascal since before you were born .
and like most men of means , he is charming ...
and often cruel .
he did not have an accident .
he refused to come .
he sent me this with all his critiques .
he hated it .
i &apos;ve done all this work and then he insults me like this ?
pascal has always viewed women as pretty fools .
chasing his approval would be a fruitless endeavor .
but if it &apos;s any consolation ,
your father couldn &apos;t be more wrong .
what you have created here is magnifique .
and as for your father ,
the only advice i can offer is this--
you can spend your life being controlled by powerful men ,
or you can learn how to control them .
will you excuse me ?
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late .
you know what ? it doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;m just-- i &apos;ve been fine .
daniel , don &apos;t be like that .
i &apos;m not doing this here .
look , i know you &apos;re upset about the fight .
this is not about the fight .
i &apos;ve been busting my ass trying to make this magazine
into something for our future .
because i knew the only way we &apos;d make it this time around
is if i stood on my own .
but tonight , when you didn &apos;t show up ,
i realized i &apos;m the only one fighting for us .
that &apos;s not true .
really ?
because lately i &apos;ve been feeling like
i &apos;m just playing a role in a story you &apos;re writing .
let &apos;s face it . we only set a date
because we thought my father was sick .
now we know he &apos;s not .
what are you saying ?
something i didn &apos;t want to admit ,
but i can &apos;t ignore it anymore .
i can &apos;t marry you , emily .
i can &apos;t let him call off the wedding , nolan .
the more things you try to control ,
the more chance for error .
i didn &apos;t come here for platitudes .
well ... sometimes they &apos;re true , ems ,
whether you want them to be or not .
i mean , can we be honest ?
daniel &apos;s changed . he &apos;s ... evolved .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
neither do i.
because you can &apos;t give him the one thing that he needs--
you .
the real you .
all people want is for their partners
to be honest with them ,
and they catch on pretty damn quick when you &apos;re not .
daniel can tell you &apos;re faking it with him--
because i can &apos;t stand to be around him .
ems ...
if you want to pull this off
and keep your promise to jack ,
you &apos;re gonna have to get past that .
because the only way to win daniel back ,
is share a piece of yourself .
that &apos;s just right , thank you .
closed the buyer for the altman in germany .
for considerably more than expected .
you &apos;re as talented a businessman as you are an artist .
they &apos;re your leads . i &apos;m just landing &apos; em .
we make a hell of a team .
always so serious .
you should have come to daniel &apos;s event .
well , that &apos;s not really my scene .
i would have enjoyed introducing you
to a pool of new people .
you &apos;re trying to set me up ?
you are . daniel was right .
you can &apos;t help yourself , can you ?
i will not allow you
to hide behind this gallery or your canvases--
beautiful as they may be .
well , there &apos;s a difference between hiding and not wanting to go .
you know , the truth is i-
i thought maybe i met someone interesting .
but , um ...
i think maybe i may have been wrong about that .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s complicated .
patrick ...
i sacrificed personal happiness for all the wrong reasons .
i hope you don &apos;t do the same .
why are you always so good to me ?
i have much to make up for .
you don &apos;t .
like i said , we are a team now , all right ?
nothing &apos;s gonna change that .
now look , i have to get back to work .
i promised daniel this piece for his office .
so i &apos;ll probably be working through the night .
i will see you tomorrow ?
bye .
okay .
bye .
我们得单独谈谈
so you &apos;re alive and well after all .
well , i &apos;m alive , anyway .
look ... about last night--
yeah , let &apos;s talk about it .
where i come from , we honor our word ,
and we deal with things in person .
i will not chase a man who does not know
how to treat a woman , and you clearly do not .
adieu , jack .
you have every right to be upset .
but please let me just explain what happened .
we had an intruder .
oh , my god .
is carl okay ?
i had to take him away , but he &apos;s safe now .
but ...
to be honest , i ...
i was scared .
and i @-@ i come attack you like this .
i &apos;m so sorry , jack .
no , no . you couldn &apos;t have known .
i &apos;m ... so sorry that i couldn &apos;t be there for you .
you &apos;re such a sweet man .
i haven &apos;t been that sweet .
and to be honest ...
you &apos;re the first person in a long time
to be able to make me smile .
i assume this is about jack porter .
were my suspicions correct ?
was he the cause of emily &apos;s late arrival
to daniel &apos;s party ?
no . she never met with him .
she just sat on her porch for a while .
i &apos;d have thought i spurred her to action .
well , maybe her fidelity to daniel
is stronger than you think .
so why the urgency for this meeting ?
well , as you know , your husband had me investigate
the cause of the wreck .
yes , to see if jack was indeed responsible .
well , the sabotage itself was easy enough to pull off .
you just puncture the line .
it &apos;s so simple , anyone could do it .
except there was no forced entry past the garage security .
which means the access code was used .
only a few people know that .
and only one of them had the opportunity that night .
why come to me ? why not go right to conrad ?
because i have chosen which master to serve .
and i knew that she would want to handle this ...
internally .
who was it ?
it was one of your children .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;ve learned something terrible .
what is it ?
aiden found out who tried to kill you .
conrad , i--
i don &apos;t know what to do .
oh , my god . who was it ?
who did this ?
charlotte ...
oh , no .
oh , god .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
no , it can &apos;t be . you couldn &apos;t have done this .
i did .
i went crazy when i learned the truth about declan ,
and i hated you for it .
and that &apos;s when i found this .
it was declan &apos;s ,
and it brought back all the feelings
about how you took him away from me ,
and i wanted you to suffer .
and then i felt so guilty ,
i couldn &apos;t even look at you .
that &apos;s why i &apos;ve been so distant .
and then mom told me you found out
and blamed jack .
and i couldn &apos;t stay quiet .
he had nothing to do with it . it was me , i swear .
i &apos;ll confess everything--
no , no , no , no . oh , god .
no .
this ends here .
you &apos;re my girl , and that &apos;s all that matters .
and i will protect you
because that is what parents do .
you can really forgive me ?
of course i can .
charlotte , all i &apos;ve ever wanted
was for us to be family again .
i mean , if this is what it took for us to have
an honest exchange , to heal our wounds ,
well , then , uh ...
charlotte , i am grateful for what you &apos;ve done .
i love you , daddy .
so it was patrick .
yeah .
i found the knife in his room .
the blade was corroded with the brake fluid .
there &apos;s no question of his guilt .
you told victoria ?
i assume she &apos;ll deal with patrick for you ?
no . i know her . she &apos;ll cover it up .
she &apos;s obsessed with him .
and since you gave her the chance to protect him ,
she &apos;ll be in your debt ,
which not only clears jack &apos;s name ,
but ... puts you right where i need you
for the final step .
well played ... as always .
emily , uh ...
i &apos;m sorry for the way i handled jack .
you were right .
my motives were not pure . i ...
i wanted him gone .
no .
i &apos;m sorry ...
for how i &apos;ve treated you .
you came back here to help me ,
and i &apos;ve made you feel used .
but the truth is ...
you mean so much more to me than that .
you &apos;re everything to me .
i knew you would understand the severity of the situation
when i called you .
thank you for coming , charlotte .
i didn &apos;t do this for you .
dad is clearly so paranoid ,
he &apos;s willing to blame a random car accident
on an innocent man .
your father has difficulty believing
that anything is accidental when it comes to him .
well , if taking the blame protects jack ,
i &apos;m fine with that .
just needed to grab a few things .
i &apos;ll crash somewhere else tonight .
i wish you wouldn &apos;t .
what do you want me to say , em ?
nothing .
i &apos;m the one who needs to talk .
what &apos;s this ?
these are your parents .
i &apos;ve never seen them before .
that &apos;s you , oh , my god .
i never would have recognized you .
it doesn &apos;t even feel like my life .
the truth is , daniel ...
i grew up in a house just like this .
i remember one night a summer storm rolled in .
it was so strong , it shook the walls .
i was so scared .
my father found me .
and i remember in that moment ,
he ... didn &apos;t treat me like a child .
he explained to me what thunder really was--
just a change in temperature and pressure .
he took the fear away ...
like he always did .
he sounds like a great dad .
he was the best .
it &apos;s hard for me
to share memories from my past , daniel .
it &apos;s even harder for me to trust .
you know , people ...
think that because i lost my family ,
i never knew what real love was .
but i did .
and it was ripped away from me .
and i still feel that pain
like it was yesterday .
that &apos;s why i push people away .
i had no idea .
i want nothing more
than to stand beside you on our wedding day .
then i want that , too .
in order to regain control ,
we sometimes must relinquish it .
by doing so , we believe we are protecting the ones we love ...
the ones we cannot live without .
patrick !
but the most dangerous truth of all ...
is that control is merely an illusion .
