The other side is collapsing,
and everyone in it is going away.
We need to start the spell again.
We can't. That was our one shot.
But Damon's on the other side.
The spell the travelers cast across Mystic Falls
eliminates spirit magic,
Vampires can't get into Mystic Falls.
They can lurk around the borders.
Luke Parker has been feeding her some concoction
that allows her to hallucinate Damon.
The herbs, they make me so thirsty.
Please help me.
Stefan didn't say good-bye.
Damon and Bonnie died and he just left.
I need you to tell me
that you're gonna find Damon and bring him back.
Because I don't think I can live forever without him.
I can't. I gave up.
I moved on.
I want you to take away Damon.
I want you to compel me to forget that
I ever loved him.
Do you think it will hurt?
I don't know.
That got awkward fast.
What happened?
Where is everybody?
Where you going?
Well, I feel a fang, so I'm still a vampire.
Either I'm a dead vampire, or Mystic Falls is no longer magic-free.
Look.
I definitely blew that up about an hour ago.
Why don't we see any people?
If we're still on the other side,
we should at least be able to see the living.
Where the hell are we?
And I don't mean geographically.
I have no idea.
Jer, come on. We're gonna be--
Matt! Sorry. I--I needed a place to crash.
Jer said it was cool.
This isn't Jer's house.
Well, it's not yours either.
Look. It's no big deal.
I can just take off.
Yeah. Why don't you do that?
Why would you bring her here?
You shouldn't be anywhere near her, dumbass,
not after what happened yesterday.
Caroline compelled her to forget Elena attacked her.
It's not a big deal.
Not a big deal?
Right. I forgot. You don't care about anything.
What are you doing?
I mean, I thought it'd be nice to--
Completely overstay my welcome.
I'm sorry. I thought, uh--
Never mind what I thought.
No. I just wasn't really expecting you to still be here, so...
Right. So why should you expect somebody
you spent the night with to make assumptions about breakfast?
I'm gonna go.
No, no, no, Ivy--
Stefan, I get it.
I am super into you, you're...
intermittently into me.
Breakfast bad.
Don't worry about it.
Ivy.
Look. Why don't we have dinner tonight,
although...
I should probably do the cooking.
It's been 4 months.
It's time for me to let go.
You gonna erase Bonnie from your head, too.
Missing Bonnie makes me sad, Jer.
Missing Damon makes me dangerous.
Alaric will compel away any memories
and then make me forget that I had him do it.
I need you to keep the truth from me, too.
Tyler and Stefan are on board.
What about Caroline?
Somehow, I doubt she'll take much convincing.
You said that Stefan was looking for a way
to bring Bonnie and Damon back.
I thought he was.
I've been feeding him leads for months.
He let me believe he was following them.
Well, I've been a little focused on magic bubble duty,
and as you can see by the lack of magic in Mystic Falls,
it's a spectacular fail of a mission,
and now you're telling me that this whole time
no one has been doing anything to help
Bonnie and Damon?
I wouldn't exactly say no one.
Come on. Just a little hint.
I don't know anything.
Oh, you witches are all so monstrously secretive.
Lucky for me, I'm quite gifted at unraveling the truth.
Ok. There's a coven in Oregon,
they found away to communicate
with their ancestors on the other side
before it went away.
Maybe they know what happened to your friends.
They call themselves the Gemini coven.
They're small and weird,
and they don't like outsiders.
See? You did know something.
I just wanted you to work for it.
Now there's a blast from the past.
Hello, gorgeous.
Talk me through it again.
I raided the psychology department's research library.
In a nutshell, we'll be using a combination
of hypnotherapy and memory reprocessing techniques.
The more we talk,
the more you'll relax
and open your mind to me.
We're gonna be searching through memories that are deeply embedded,
and each significant memory that we hit
which is connected to Damon I will help you modify,
and this should eventually lead us
to the signature memory, which once erased
will create a positive domino effect
through all your other memories.
Can't you just compel me to forget everything at once,
And we can go get a beer?
I'm supernaturally rewiring 3 years of your memories.
If it were that easy, I wouldn't be so terrified.
I have some questions.
Answer them honestly.
I will answer everything honestly.
Do you have doubts about this?
Yes, but I know I have to do this.
Are you afraid?
More sad than afraid.
Why sad?
Because I don't want to stop loving him.
Do you trust me to be digging around in your mind?
I trust you completely.
Ok.
Well, then let's...
Let's get started.
Who was Damon Salvatore?
He was my boyfriend.
I loved him, and he died.
And when did you first meet him?
I was in high school.
Katherine.
No. I'm Elena.
I'm Damon.
And what was he like?
There was something different about him,
dangerous but not in a way that scared me.
He was exciting.
I don't know what I want.
That's not true.
You want what everybody wants.
What?
And how did he make you feel?
Like anything was possible.
You had a nice moment on the road with a stranger,
but that's all he was, a stranger.
A stranger.
Two people passing in the night.
Are you ok?
Yeah. Let's just-- let's just keep going.
How many more streets are we gonna wander?
How many times are you gonna ask me questions
I don't have the answers to?
There's something weird about these cars.
Yeah, they're almost all 20 years old or more,
and yet they look brand-new.
And that is Elena's not-so-burnt-to-a-crisp house.
Look.
"Rare solar eclipse expected to be seen across 12 states."
The date.
May 10...1994.
Is that--are we-- that's impossible.
I don't think we should be asking where we are.
I think we should be asking when we are.
Tell me about this moment.
No. You know what?
If I'm gonna feel guilty about something,
I'm gonna feel guilty about this.
He kissed me.
I mean, I shouldn't have let him.
I knew that he was in love with me,
and even thought Stefan and I were on the outs,
I shouldn't have let him.
He kissed you. You thought it was inappropriate.
You told him so.
I told him it was wrong.
Who's Damon Salvatore?
He was my boyfriend.
I loved him, and...
He...
He died.
Why don't we, uh--
why don't we take A little break, ok?
To be honest, I could use a drink.
Wonder if there's any booze in this empty retroville.
Feels so weird to be back here.
Practically grew up on this porch.
All right. Talk me through it.
Before the other side collapsed,
my grams said that she made a sacrifice so I could find peace.
The part where you actually have a theory.
Well, this clearly isn't peace.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be stuck here with you.
Rude.
She must have-- I don't know--
Sent me somewhere, and when I held your hand,
took you with me.
Well, did she happen to whisper a safe word
in her last breaths, a clue maybe,
witchy path out of here?
No, but if we got here by magic,
magic should be able to get us out.
And that frown that's not upside down is telling me what?
Phesmatos, incendia.
Still can't do magic.
Perfect.
You're the last person I think would object
to me erasing positive memories of Damon from my head.
Yeah, but we we are literally chasing a lead.
What if we find something out?
What if Damon returns home
and everything returns back to normal
and then you're just sitting there
all confused and weird?
Then Alaric will bring back my memories.
But...
But what?
Go ahead, Caroline. Say what you need to say.
I don't want to pressure you into agreeing.
I don't know what to say.
I was actually just trying to think of what Bonnie would say.
And?
And she'd say that you should do what's best for you.
Look. I think it's great that you still have hope, I really do,
but for fo own survival, I need to let him go.
Well, then go on with your
"What would Bonnie Bennett do?" plan.
I'll make bumper stickers.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Girl bonding. Very sweet.
I heard you dropped out of school.
And I heard that you were a lurker who was spying on my life.
When do we exit?
Soon. You should reconsider.
Looks can only get a girl so far these days.
Heh. Yeah, well, I'm not taking feminist tips
from the guy who just used his tongue
to get secrets out of a coat check girl.
Garment attendant.
You just made that up.
So did you also make up the Gemini coven lead, too?
Because I've never heard of them.
Who are they?
No idea. That's not where we're headed.
What?!
Wait. Where are we going?
You'll see.
Perfect timing. I was just--
I ran into some of your friends.
What? Where?
Here.
Stefan! You are a hard man to track down.
I wasn't sure if your new friend
would invite us in, but she said this was your place,
which means open invitation for all your mates, right?
Got any bourbon?
Good stuff, mate.
So how do you guys know Stefan?
He and I went to high school together.
He used to date my best friend.
Not that he's not allowed to date.
I mean, they broke up.
I just didn't realize that he had met someone.
So how did you meet exactly?
Uh, Ivy's car was in the shop where I work.
You work in an auto repair shop?
It's relaxing.
Why? What did you used to do?
Oh, man of all seasons, jack of all trades.
Oh, you have a lovely clavicle.
Oh! Thank you. I think.
Forgive me. I always notice a woman's neck.
I'm a neck person!
So's Stefan. Right, Stefan?
Not anymore.
Well, that's silly.
You can't just stop being a neck person.
Is Enzo your boyfriend?
Oh! Oh, god no.
Would you date that?
Uh, hello. I'm right here.
I have supersensitive hearing,
practically supernatural.
Do you believe in the supernatural, Ivy?
Uh, never really thought about it.
Myself, I'm a believer.
Had to get a witch to do a locator spell to find my buddy here.
I didn't know you cooked.
I don't. How'd you sleep?
Me--not good. My 1994 mattress was very lumpy.
What you go there?
Miss cuddles.
I lost her when I was 9, but I went into my house last night,
and there she was.
I also found this at my grams' house,
her old grimoire.
Yeah? Well, I found this.
Drank it last year when Ric died.
So we're in this snapshot of another time or something.
Everything that existed in 1994
still exists.
For better or for worse.
Listen. There was a time when I couldn't practice magic.
This grimoire taught me a lot.
Maybe I can reteach myself.
If you're still a witch,
which with our luck and your skill probably ain't the case.
Would a little support kill you?
I am acutely aware that we are in some otherworldly time dimension.
However, did you ever think for one second
that maybe it's you being negative
reacting to my natural self negatively, hmm?
You're ridiculous.
Nope. I'm consistent.
Eat your pancakes.
Oh, and...
You can do a crossword puzzle.
Oh, gee, thanks.
Breakfast with my least favorite person
and a crossword puzzle from 1994.
All right.
What's a 7-letter word for...
You've got to be kidding me.
Bonnie, look at the date on that paper.
It says May 10, 1994.
It's the same day as yesterday.
We're living the same day
all over again.
Well, that proves it.
We're in hell,
my own personal, custom-built hell,
and you're in it with me.
Bottoms up.
A little early for that, don't you think?
It's dark out.
I meant in life.
Where's Sarah?
Don't know. Not her keeper.
I'm going for a jog.
You guys don't like each other very much, do you?
He's trying to give me purpose.
Why didn't you tell him I'm still here?
Didn't feel like it.
5 miles with the group this morning wasn't enough for you?
Tripp, hey.
I was just blowing off some steam. What's up?
That girl from yesterday,
the one with the animal bite.
Do you know where she ended up?
Yeah, my house.
I'm not sure how that happened.
She there now?
No. She split. Why?
I have some deputy buddies over at the station.
One of them said that the sheriff ran her plates
and the car came up stolen.
You're kidding.
No.
Now I can be paranoid, but there's a bad element coming through town,
I want to keep tabs on it.
Yeah.
So let me know if she shows up back up at your place.
Yeah, I will.
It was the Miss Mystic Falls Pageant.
Stefan was supposed to be my escort,
but he bailed on me.
Damon stepped in.
He saved me from being embarrassed
in front of everyone.
He took my arm and led me out
with the rest of the girls and all their dates,
and we danced.
I remember that was the first time
that I felt it.
Felt what?
How sexy he was.
I'd never...
let myself notice until then.
I mean, obviously, I knew that he was attractive,
but I didn't want to see him that way.
You went down the stairs,
and no one was there.
I was embarrassed, but I got over it.
Who is Damon Salvatore?
He was my boyfriend. I loved him,
and he died.
Ric, I hate this.
I mean, how much longer is it gonna take?
Until we find that signature moment,
the moment you knew you loved him.
Well, that's easy.
It was after I found out about the sire bond.
Everyone kept telling me that my feelings weren't real,
but I knew that they were.
Ok. Your feelings were because of the sire bond.
Who is Damon Salvatore?
He was my boyfriend.
That's not it. You got to dig deeper, earlier.
I-I don't know, ok? I...
Maybe it was when we spent the night at the motel together.
I wasn't back together with Stefan yet,
and I remember when I was laying in bed with him
all I could think about was kissing him.
I wanted to kiss him so badly.
No one kissed anyone. Who's Damon Salvatore?
He was my boyfriend.
That's not it. Next.
I don't know, Ric!
Well, think about it, Elena.
Think about that moment when you knew
this person was somebody that you had feelings for,
that you loved,
and that you could see those feelings going on forever.
Trust me. You never forget it.
Maybe we should just forget about this entire thing.
It was a stupid idea, ok?
I can't do this anymore, all right?
I'm done. I'm sorry.
What's a 7-letter word for "Kill me now"?
That joke got old 6 weeks ago.
So did this crossword puzzle.
Every day for two months,
I've done this stupid thing,
And I still can't figure out 27 across.
"An old tongue twister Eddie turned top 40"?
And I hate pancakes!
Whoa. Don't take it out on the pancakes.
Those pancakes, like myself,
are waiting for you to be witchy to get us the hell out of here.
You know I've been trying.
And failing.
Further evidence we're in hell.
Not only am I stuck with you,
I'm stuck with the useless version of you.
Did you hear that?
What would I have heard, Bonnie?
We're the only two people here.
We were the only two people here two months ago,
and we're the only two people here now!
Well, I swear I heard something.
Maybe it's the sound of existential despair.
I hear that's what hell sounds like.
You know what? You think we're trapped in your hell?
I have to spend every day on repeat
with the person I like least on this earth.
Maybe we're trapped in mine.
So, Stefan, tell us.
This house, very charming.
When'd you get it?
About a month or so ago.
No. More than that, remember?
We met two months ago, and you already had it.
You've lived here for more than two months?
Yeah. Yeah. I guess I have.
Well, I guess that's just weird
because everyone thought you were living somewhere else,
and your job was supposed to be investigative work,
not auto repair.
Right. Well, I've moved on from that job.
Well, you can't move on from investigative work
until you've solved the investigation, stefan.
How about we just drop it?
I'm happy doing what I'm doing now,
and that's all that should really matter, right?
There, darling, no need to make a scene.
Really it's all probably just some big misunderstanding.
Perhaps this will clear it all up.
Aah! Oh, my god!
Enzo!
What the hell is wrong with you?
So many secrets.
What are you running from, Stefan?
Oh. I-I don't.
Calm down, come with me. Let's go upstairs.
No need to make a scene?
What kind of coward gives up on his own brother?
You don't know what you're talking about.
Why don't you enlighten me?
Hey. This is really not a good time.
I'm sorry. I've just hit a wall with Elena.
I just need some insight.
Ok. What's the wall?
I'm trying to get her to figure out
when she first fell in love with Damon,
but she can't seem to get there.
Well, yeah, because she doesn't want to admit
what everyone else already knows.
She fell in love with Damon when she was still with Stefan.
Should probably get him out of here.
He'll be up soon, and I really don't feel like another go-around.
I'm sorry that you heard what I said.
It's fine, Caroline.
I really don't care.
Why?
Why don't you care?
You were the one who always cared.
It's what I liked about you.
You know, amidst all the crazy in our perfectly messed up lives,
you cared more than anyone,
so how could you just stop?
Because I had to.
I had to move on.
You know, the months before I moved here,
I was following every lead that Alaric sent my way.
I spoke to every witch, every shaman,
every psychic in 20 countries around the globe,
and every lead was a dead end.
But Enzo has another lead.
There's this coven in Oregon --
The Gemini coven. Yeah.
I looked into them, too, Caroline.
There was nothing there. Because there's nothing we can do.
Damon and Bonnie are dead.
I had to come to terms with that,
and once I did, I had to start over.
I couldn't just live my old life with my old friends.
I couldn't go near Mystic Falls or Elena --
Or me?
Because I thought we were closer than that.
I mean, you couldn't hear in all those messages that I left you,
you couldn't hear that I was completely falling apart without you?
Because you never listened to them.
I had to move on. I didn't have a choice.
I had to erase everything.
Well, let me summarize them for you.
You're a dick.
And if you want him out of your house,
you throw him out yourself.
...is not available. Leave a message.
Luke, where are you?
I need more of that stuff, like, now.
I'm starting to go...
I don't want to hear it, Ric, ok?
We tried. It didn't work.
It's over.
It didn't work because you weren't being honest.
I wasn't--
Are you crazy?
I was being completely honest.
Do you think I want to talk to you about my romantic life?
You weren't being honest with yourself.
Look. I want to hear all the Damon stuff
while you were still with Stefan.
No. I was completely faithful to Stefan.
Of course you were.
I did everything.
I know.
I stuck with him,
even when he lost his humanity...
I know you did.
after he left a trail of bodies
from Florida to Virginia.
I fought for him.
I know you did, Elena.
You don't want to admit it
because you feel like you're betraying Stefan,
but this won't work until you do.
No. I loved Stefan the entire time.
I never would have hurt him.
Elena, you have been lucky enough to love
two people this deeply in your young life.
There's nothing wrong with that.
It's ok.
It's ok to love them both.
That's what Katherine used to say.
How sad is it that my own evil doppelganger
was smarter than me?
It's ok, Elena. You can tell me.
Tell me the moment you knew you loved him.
It was my birthday.
Damon and I spent the entire summer looking for Stefan,
and I was trying to put on a good face
because Caroline was throwing this party for me,
but I was so sad.
I was two seconds from deciding that I wasn't gonna go.
I wasn't gonna leave the room
until Damon walked in
to give me my birthday gift.
It was a necklace that Stefan had given me.
I'd lost it, and Damon knew
what the necklace meant to me.
My necklace.
What it meant about my feelings for Stefan.
Even though he loved me,
he gave me the one thing that represented hope
for me and his brother.
I knew how much it hurt him,
but he did it.
It was...
the most selfless that he's ever been,
and in that moment, I loved him.
I didn't want to.
It terrified me, but...
for that moment, I loved him.
Do it.
It's ok. I'm ready.
I need you to be sure.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
Just take it away, please.
Damon never came into the room.
He never gave you the necklace.
The party was miserable,
and you spent the rest of the night at the house watching movies
and eating popcorn with Jeremy.
Damon, no!
Jeremy.
Damon...
killed Jeremy.
He snapped his neck right in front of me.
Elena...
Who is Damon Salvatore?
He's Stefan's Brother.
He was a monster,
and then he died.
Hey, you.
Put on some party clothes and come to Whitmore.
Tyler's coming over, and we are going out.
You sound good.
I am good. I had a good day.
I ditched all my classes and hung out with Ric.
We, um, we talked about Bonnie.
I had a good cry, and I don't know.
I really feel like things are taking a turn for the better.
So get your ass down here,
and let's have some fun.
Well, how about I come and sneak into the dorms
and spend the night later
for old time's sake?
Sounds perfect. Love you.
Love you, too.
Well, well.
That was a bit of a bust.
I'll be right back.
Hey. Did your friends leave?
Whoa. What happened?
Oh, you know, my friend, he's, Uh,
a bad drunk.
Well, at least your friend Caroline seemed nice.
Yeah.
I'm gonna throw this out.
Let her go.
Ok.
I've got a girl out there crying over you
because she cares so much,
and I'm here trying to figure out why
but I can't see what's worth caring about.
You know, Damon once told me that he promised you
an eternity of misery, and I remember thinking,
"Well, what could his brother have ever done
to inspire so much hatred?"
But now I get it.
You're not a brother to him.
Brothers don't give up.
So every time I see you doing anything
that looks like you've done so,
every time you try to start over in a life
that's nothing but a lie,
I will make you pay.
I will be the one to bring you the misery you deserve.
See? We're still neck people.
It's Bonnie.
Leave me a message.
Hey. It's me. I paid your cell bill again.
Your mom said I could.
I think she felt sorry for me or something.
Maybe she just wants to hear the sound of your voice, too.
What do I know?
I am so pissed at you, Bonnie.
Yeah. Still. You told me you were gonna die over the phone,
so you kind of deserve me railing at you on voicemails
that you're never gonna get.
I guess I'll call and yell at you again tomorrow.
Gah! You scared the hell out of me.
We got a little problem.
Sarah's shady. The plates on her car are stolen.
She's got to go.
What are you-- deputy Dewey?
How do you know that?
It doesn't matter how he knows it.
He's right. I stole it from my old boss.
He had wandering hands,
so I wandered my hands to his car keys.
Look, no offense, but you got to find someplace else to stay.
I totally get it.
I appreciate you guys helping me.
Really, I do.
It's ok. I have family here sort of.
I mean, I haven't met him,
but my dad, he supposedly lives here.
It's not like he's gonna let me sleep on the street, right?
Matt, at least let her stay till she finds her dad.
Seriously, Jer?
I'm on the community protection committee,
and she's a car thief.
All right. Fine.
We can go stay at Stefan and Damon's. No one's there.
You can't leave. I told Elena that I'd watch out for you.
It's not like she can do anything about it.
So she says she has family here.
That's probably another lie,
but I'll look into it.
Thanks, Matt.
Look. Jeremy's a good kid.
He's just going through some stuff.
I know all about him.
I grew up with his dad.
Wait. You're from Mystic Falls?
Born and raised till my parents split.
I think that's why I'm such a geek about this town.
My family were such big supporters,
one of the founding families actually.
Which family?
The Fells.
I'm Thomas Vincent Fell iii, to be exact.
My dad called me Tripp,
but I was such a clumsy kid
that I took my mom's maiden name when he bailed.
Can you imagine-- Tripp Fell?
So if you're from a founding family,
that means you know all the stuff that goes along with it then, right?
Is there a secret handshake I never got taught?
Look. Um, I got to go.
I'll see you later for training, though, yeah?
Yeah, sure.
Any final words?
I miss them, too, you know?
Look who got 27 across.
I wish. 27 across is a rock
I am pushing up an endless mountain.
"An old tongue twister Eddie turned top 40."
Eddie Vedder, Pearl Jam.
"Yellow Ledbetter."
Good work.
Are you messing with me?
No. Are you messing with me?
I didn't finish this.
Well, neither did I.
There's someone else here.
