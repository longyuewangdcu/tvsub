i don &apos;t have anything against you ,
but i &apos;m not gonna cause trouble with a guy like that
for someone i &apos;ve never even met .
so if he wants me to switch for a few hours , i &apos;m switching .
if something happens to him in there ,
i will never forgive you .
what do you want , harvey ?
help me protect mike ross .
he &apos;s in there with a guy i put away , and the guy is no joke .
what am i supposed to do ?
you &apos;re supposed to move the guy to another prison .
you got a lot of balls saying that to me
when the entire time we were working together ,
you knew the kid was a fraud .
i don &apos;t need your forgiveness , sean .
i need your help .
you want me one @-@ on @-@ one , you got it .
i &apos;m gonna use this , and they &apos;re gonna hold you .
no !
what &apos;s going on here ?
why &apos;d you come back with a guard ?
i didn &apos;t do it to get you to forgive me .
i never should have let him in here in the first place .
i don &apos;t even know your name .
kevin . kevin miller .
louis , you have the right idea ,
but the wrong execution .
if we &apos;re going to look like a real firm ,
we need to do something about subletting these offices .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
so , is everything on my application in order ?
yes , it is .
good .
because in that case , i &apos;d like to get down to the particulars .
forget the application .
i need to know what the hell kind of man you are .
excuse me ?
what &apos;s your firm &apos;s carbon footprint ?
louis , not again .
carbon footprint ?
we &apos;re a law firm , why would i--
jesus christ .
miami &apos;s gonna be underwater in five years ,
and you don &apos;t have a goddamn green policy ?
you know what ? this interview &apos;s over .
interview ? this was supposed to be a lease negotiation .
tell your story walking , jerk @-@ off .
goddamn it , louis .
that is the fifth tenant
you have scared away because of some bullshit .
this isn &apos;t bullshit , jessica .
really ?
since when do you care about the environment ?
or genetically modified cucumbers ?
or the plight of the lgbt community ?
those are legitimate causes close to my heart .
you &apos;re being ridiculous .
yeah , well , had the french been more ridiculous ,
they wouldn &apos;t have the nazis goose @-@ stepping
through their streets for six years .
are you really comparing this to that ?
i stand by that statement .
then stand by this .
you don &apos;t find a new tenant by tomorrow ,
then the rent is coming out of your pocket .
so do we eat together in the cafeteria from now on
or how does that work ?
you know this isn &apos;t high school , right ?
yeah , of course i know that .
you are going to the pep rally , though , right ?
seriously , mike , gallo &apos;s not going to forget about you ,
and now me , which means--
we need to have each other &apos;s backs .
exactly . so from now on , we don &apos;t just eat together ,
we stick together as much as possible .
the only time i see that being a problem
is afternoons between 2 : 00 and 4 : 00 .
i took a job working in the kitchen .
then starting from today , i &apos;m gonna be doing something
very public from 2 : 00 to 4 : 00 .
ross , you &apos;re coming with me .
why , is there a problem ?
that &apos;s not for me to say .
well , where are we going ?
the counselor wants to see you .
yeah , we &apos;re on our way to breakfast , man .
well , then you can save him a biscuit ,
but he &apos;s coming with me .
let &apos;s go .
what are you doing here ?
i heard what happened .
so you know that jessica was being an asshole ?
what i heard was that you interviewed five tenants ,
and you found a way to turn them all down .
so why don &apos;t you tell me what the hell &apos;s going on ?
everything &apos;s going on .
what are you talking about ?
donna , nobody &apos;s gonna be taking these offices
without taking the bullpen .
it &apos;s the heart and soul of this space .
and it &apos;s also the heart and soul of you .
exactly , which is why i will not stand
for another firm to stick their promiscuous associates
in my innocent incubator .
okay , i &apos;m gonna choose not to respond to that except to say ,
did it ever occur to you to rent to someone without the bullpen ?
donna , that &apos;s never gonna happen .
it could .
you &apos;ve only been looking at law firms
and law firms need communal spaces , but--
other firms don &apos;t . oh , my god .
why didn &apos;t i think of that ?
we can go with financial planners for high net worth individuals .
that &apos;s it . they &apos;re old school .
they have privileged conversations .
they &apos;re pussies .
again , i &apos;m not gonna engage .
and best of all they &apos;re not legally savvy ,
and i can shove any fine print down their throats that i want .
donna , you &apos;re a genius .
the only thing left for me to do is make sure you don &apos;t shit the bed in another interview .
what makes you think i would do that ?
every conversation we &apos;ve ever had , including this one .
fair point . set it up .
you wanted to see me ?
yes , and maybe you can explain
why you haven &apos;t come to see me yet .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about the fact that frank gallo
pulled a knife on you in the common area .
look , i appreciate your concern , but i &apos;m fine .
fine ?
mike , you are lucky he didn &apos;t cut you into a million pieces .
what difference does it make ?
i didn &apos;t come to you because there &apos;s nothing you can do about it .
i &apos;m here to help you .
yeah , but you can &apos;t , can you ?
look , i already told you gallo has guards in his pockets ,
and you told me you have no authority over the guards .
then file a formal allegation .
no way i am doing that .
listen to me , you have had two incidents with this man .
now , if it goes on record , it triggers an investigation .
and then every single guard and inmate
in this place will know what i did .
and would you rather have a hypothetical problem
or deal with your real problem
that isn &apos;t going away by itself ?
what i &apos;d like is to not have to choose either one .
well , i &apos;ve got news for you , bro .
one way or another ,
you &apos;re making that choice whether you like it or not .
well , you seem to be okay .
i &apos;m guessing that wasn &apos;t some trick by gallo
to split us up before ?
no , it wasn &apos;t .
then how about you tell me what that counselor wanted ?
it &apos;s not important .
hey , when i said we can &apos;t leave each other alone ,
i meant information too ,
and he &apos;s not yanking you down there first thing in the morning for nothing .
it &apos;s not important because what he wanted , i &apos;m not doing .
i get it .
he wanted you to inform on gallo , and you don &apos;t trust me .
that &apos;s not true ,
but i don &apos;t have to tell you about every offer i get that i don &apos;t take .
yeah , that &apos;s fine ,
but i need you to understand what he &apos;s asking you to do ,
because if you rat on gallo ,
i &apos;m gonna be left here by myself .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about mark higgins .
he was my roommate when i first got here .
he was being harassed by some different asshole ,
taking a beating a couple times a week ,
and that counselor , julius ,
convinced him to go on record .
two weeks later , they put him in a coma .
he never came out .
so you &apos;re telling me that i can &apos;t trust julius ?
i &apos;m saying mark did ,
and mark &apos;s not here anymore .
harvey , where have you been ? jessica needs--
donna , i need you to get sean cahill on the phone ,
and i need it yesterday .
i know you &apos;re worried about mike ,
but let the man do his job .
i &apos;m not stopping him from doing his job .
i &apos;m telling him to do it faster .
what do you want me to do , harvey ?
i &apos;ve left him a dozen messages--
then leave him a dozen more , and while you &apos;re at it ,
don &apos;t leave your desk until he calls back .
i can &apos;t do that .
why the hell not ?
because i &apos;m making sure that louis doesn &apos;t blow it with another tenant today .
then get rachel to do that .
harvey , rachel has law school .
and besides that , this is something that i want to do .
donna , i don &apos;t give a shit about louis and his tenants .
well , i do .
because we all said that we would give everything we had
to get this place back to where it was ,
and right now ,
jessica has a prospect waiting for you in the conference room .
so instead of coming down on me and sean for doing our jobs ,
why don &apos;t you get over there and do yours ?
the plaintiff id &apos;d the defendant , your honor .
it &apos;s an open and shut case .
no , it isn &apos;t ,
because his reliability as a witness can &apos;t be ignored .
what are you talking about ? his eyes work perfectly .
yes , and so does his mouth ,
because as the record shows ,
he has a history of making false statements to extort settlements .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s a little ironic ,
you questioning someone &apos;s character in an ethics class ?
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i think the court knows what it means .
and what i think is if you &apos;re trying
to disparage me to score some points ,
then you should have the guts to say what you mean .
so , naomi , how is it ironic coming from me ?
okay , everyone , why don &apos;t we take a quick break ?
it &apos;s ironic because your fiancé
is currently serving a two @-@ year sentence for fraud ,
and no matter what you say , everyone here knows you knew .
all right , that &apos;s enough for today .
but , naomi , if you &apos;re gonna impugn another lawyer &apos;s character ,
you should know that in the eyes of a jury ,
it doesn &apos;t say great things about your own .
rachel , can i speak to you for a minute ?
i &apos;m sorry , professor , i have another class in five minutes .
they say coffee &apos;s for closers , but it &apos;s not .
is that a fact ?
yeah , which is why i gave it up two years ago ,
because that shit &apos;ll kill you .
so will playing chicken with the sec ,
but you don &apos;t seem to have a problem with that .
you know who i am .
i also know you have an indictment on the horizon ,
and you &apos;re looking for new representation
because no lawyer in his right mind
wants to touch you with a ten @-@ foot pole .
if that &apos;s how you talk to prospective clients ,
maybe i don &apos;t want to get to know you better .
i think you do because you got nowhere else to go .
the question is , what makes you think i &apos;d take you on ?
gee , i don &apos;t know .
why don &apos;t we ask one of the hundreds of associates
you have walking around here ?
oh , wait , you don &apos;t have any associates walking around here .
i get it -- you think we &apos;re down and desperate .
no , i think you played chicken with the aba ,
came up short ,
and now you need a high @-@ profile client and a big , goddamn win
or you &apos;re gonna be on the street in about ten minutes .
what i need is to kick your ass out of here right the hell now
because i &apos;m not interested in your kind of client .
all right , fun time &apos;s over .
i &apos;ll pay you a retainer and triple your rate .
you can quintuple my rate .
my answer &apos;s never gonna change .
listen to me . we are a perfect fit .
i need this and you do too .
and it works out , my business is your firm &apos;s the rest of my life .
that &apos;s exactly why i don &apos;t want it .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;m gonna enjoy my coffee .
i &apos;d wish you luck with your sec troubles , william ,
but i wouldn &apos;t mean it .
where is he ?
he &apos;s not here .
what do you mean he &apos;s not here ?
i mean he &apos;s taking his 4 : 15 constitutional .
you mean he &apos;s in the bathroom .
i believe that &apos;s the situation ,
but i prefer to tell myself he &apos;s out for a stroll .
i feel like a new man .
like a 100 @-@ pound load off my shoulders .
i think we all know that &apos;s not where it came from .
well , that was fun . come on , louis .
we &apos;ve got some appointments to make .
no need . i took care of it .
what ?
what do you think i meant by a load off my shoulders ?
i signed the new tenant .
without me ?
well , yes . listen , i found this sweet old man
who runs a bunch of friendly money managers
looking to expand ,
and they &apos;re all , like , 1,000 years old .
they &apos;re not even gonna need the bullpen ,
and they start tomorrow , and it &apos;s gonna be perfect .
no , louis , it &apos;s not going to be perfect .
what are you talking about ?
we said we were gonna do this together ,
and i am a part of this firm as much as you are ,
and when you go ahead and you do something like this
without me , it really pisses me off .
donna , i &apos;m sorry .
i just wanted to prove to myself that i could not screw this up .
well , don &apos;t come running to me when you do .
oh , please tell me
you &apos;re making just plain old mashed potatoes .
i am getting so sick of that au gratin bullshit
they keep serving us .
why don &apos;t you take it up with the cook ?
well , what if i want to take it up with you ?
well , i &apos;d say you &apos;re shit out of luck
because it is not my call .
actually , i feel hip deep in luck
finding you here all by yourself .
you &apos;re not gonna do anything to me here .
there &apos;s too many other people .
you know , when i first got here ,
i didn &apos;t have a high school diploma .
surprise , surprise .
before you know it i was a regular poindexter just like you .
congratulations . your parents must be so proud .
they are .
i loved all my subjects , but math was my favorite ,
transitive property in particular .
gallo , we &apos;ve been over this .
you &apos;re gonna get to harvey through me .
thank you . got it .
that &apos;s true , but that &apos;s just the beginning ,
because if i can get to harvey through you ,
that must mean i can get to you through somebody else .
you leave kevin out of this .
a little late for that , mike .
see , in here we use the buddy system .
you left your buddy alone .
what the hell did you do ?
why don &apos;t you find out for yourself ?
he &apos;s in the bathroom . i &apos;d hurry if i were you .
he &apos;s not gonna be conscious much longer .
kevin .
hey , what happened ?
i &apos;d say you should see the other guy , mike ,
but there were three of them .
oh , come on , hey , get up .
i thought you said you were gonna stay in the open .
everyone needs to go to the bathroom ,
and gallo and his buddies were waiting for me when i got here .
come on , we got to get you to the infirmary .
no , no ! we can &apos;t .
you need someone to look at you .
we can &apos;t !
that &apos;s exactly what gallo wants .
because if we go to the infirmary ,
we &apos;re gonna have to file a report .
yeah , and then he won &apos;t have to lay a finger on us
because someone else will do it for him .
what are we gonna do ?
the only thing we can do .
suck it up and take it
until gallo gets someone else in his sights .
dude , i don &apos;t give a shit what those douches say .
those shares aren &apos;t worth the tampons they &apos;re printed on .
what floor ?
tell them to stick it in their ass .
i &apos;m on the phone , guy .
i know . i understand that , but--
pearson specter litt . what business do you have with our--
oh , jesus christ . lick my balls .
what did you just say to me ?
hold on , skidmarks .
en el telefono , hombre . comprende ?
all right , man , i got to jet .
we &apos;re settling into our new digs today .
all right , later , brosef stalin .
excuse me .
i couldn &apos;t help but overhear .
there must be some mistake .
we &apos;re leasing space to the satellite division
of the stevens investment group .
that &apos;s me , pal , stu buzzini . i run the satellite division .
well , that wasn &apos;t made clear to me when i met your boss .
old man river ?
he &apos;s not gonna drag his ass in here every day .
he &apos;s got one foot in the grave .
well , then , did he share with you the lease agreement ?
because it clearly outlined a dress code .
you think i wear this to work ?
what am i , an asshole ?
next time you see me i &apos;ll be in a suit
three times more expensive than yours .
this is a brioni .
it &apos;s a bri @-@ shitty , as far as i &apos;m concerned .
come on , buddy , give me some .
come on , brah , don &apos;t leave me hanging .
wha--i don &apos;t--
bssh . that &apos;s my girl .
i &apos;m just kidding , sally .
holler at me if you need anything , okay ?
i &apos;m looking forward to being douche @-@ mates .
shit stick , huh , you get that girl &apos;s number last night ?
that &apos;s right .
ball sack , how did you track us down , man ?
i thought we fired you .
holy goddamn shit , what have i done ?
come on , boys , let &apos;s make some money !
donna , listen to me .
i know .
then you know that i--
shit the bed like you never have before ?
i am so--
banged the monkey ?
screwed the pooch ?
donna , please--
flinked the flank ?
what does flink the flank mean ?
it means i &apos;m not finished enjoying this .
when do you think you &apos;ll be finished ?
because i need to know what to do .
i don &apos;t know . when does their lease expire ?
oh , my god , i cooked in an extension option !
louis , relax .
the important thing to remember here
is that this is your fault for not listening to me .
how does that help me ?
it doesn &apos;t . it helps me .
donna !
okay , listen to me .
if you really want my help , i &apos;m gonna give it to you .
what &apos;s gonna happen is ,
sometime in the next 24 hours , a minor incident
that would mean nothing to anybody else but you
is gonna make you want to undo this fiasco .
i want to undo it right now .
but i &apos;m telling you not to
because in addition to making things worse ,
jessica will kill you .
so just wait things out and in another--
i &apos;m sorry , when does their lease expire again ?
18 months .
18 months ...
this whole thing will be a distant memory .
can you do that ?
can you let it go ?
yes , i think you can .
you can do it .
yes , i can .
then go forth and conquer .
i &apos;m gonna give him about an hour and a half .
jessica , what can i do for you ?
what are you so happy about ?
i just saw our new tenants .
a bunch of dickhead traders .
they &apos;re gonna drive louis crazy .
well , i just got a very interesting phone call ,
but i &apos;m not smiling about it .
nigerian prince leaving you his inheritance ?
because i got news for you , it &apos;s a scam .
i hope it &apos;s a scam
because i just heard you turned down a client
whose investment firm is worth $ 2 billion .
well , i don &apos;t give a shit how much they &apos;re worth .
i &apos;m not representing william sutter .
oh , yes , you are ,
or you &apos;re gonna give me a hell of a reason why not .
you want the reason ?
this guy makes madoff and forstman look like saints ,
and i &apos;m not getting involved with anther criminal .
harvey , i don &apos;t think you understand what &apos;s going on here .
we &apos;re filling up these offices with subletters
to make it look like we &apos;re still alive ,
but if we don &apos;t land a new client
and show the world that we &apos;re back ,
then we may as well let them have the space for good .
then let me land someone else .
well , then it better be someone huge ,
and you better do it in the next 48 hours
because that &apos;s when i set our next appointment with sutter ,
and when we get there , we &apos;re signing him as a client .
you know who you have to go to , right ?
donna , no way . not him .
harvey , you heard jessica .
we &apos;re in trouble , and you know it ,
and nathan burns isn &apos;t a criminal .
he &apos;s just an asshole .
an asshole i told i &apos;d never get into business with .
well , that &apos;s too bad
because i set up a meeting with him
the second i saw jessica heading for your office .
mike , i can &apos;t talk right now .
i have an inmate coming in in about five minutes .
good , because this will take about five seconds .
you need to get gallo transferred to another block ,
and you need to do it right now .
calm down and tell me what happened .
i am calm .
he attacked my cellmate while i was working .
now , this is a huge prison .
you get him goddamn moved .
i don &apos;t have the authority to do that .
that &apos;s the second time this week you told me
you can &apos;t help me after telling me you can help me .
mike , listen--
and don &apos;t tell me
to make a formal allegation again
because that is just going to make this worse .
it doesn &apos;t have to .
is that what you told mark higgins ?
that &apos;s out of line .
how dare you ask me about discussions
i &apos;ve had with another inmate .
from what i understand ,
he can &apos;t have discussions with anyone anymore .
and i don &apos;t want to hear what happened to him .
i just want to figure out how to get out of here alive .
well , i can &apos;t help you do that
if you keep talking to me like that .
listen to me , julius , i &apos;m sorry ,
but i cannot tell on gallo .
so if you can &apos;t get him moved ,
i need to quit my job ,
because kevin is my only friend in here .
that &apos;s two hours a day that he &apos;s exposed .
i &apos;m not gonna leave him alone again .
mike , i hate to keep telling you no ,
but that &apos;s not how it works in here .
how what works in here ?
you can &apos;t just walk away from a job ,
and there &apos;s nothing i can do about that .
harvey specter , as i live and breathe .
good to see you , nathan .
no , it &apos;s not .
i was wondering how long it would take after your lawyers left
before you came here begging me to take you on .
do i look like i &apos;m begging ?
to tell you the truth ,
i didn &apos;t expect you until next week .
you know , desperation &apos;s a beautiful thing .
okay , you got me .
the question is , do you want to keep sticking it to me
or do you want to take my one @-@ time @-@ only offer
to become my number one client ?
okay , harvey , i &apos;m done sticking it to you ,
if you want my business , you &apos;ll have to earn it .
what do you think these front row knicks tickets are for ?
great . i &apos;ll give them to my stepson
because he &apos;s too stupid to know the knicks suck .
what do you want , nathan ?
lockwood energy .
they &apos;ve been a pain in my ass for ten years .
now they &apos;re trying to bring their business to my backyard .
and you want me to block them ?
i want you to shove so many restraining orders up their ass
they can &apos;t even breathe ,
and i want it done by the time we sit down
for appetizers tonight at per se .
then the next time you see me ,
they &apos;ll be a speck in your rear view mirror .
but , nathan , when i get there ,
you better have a scotch waiting for me .
you can order one for both of us
when you call and make the reservations .
8 p.m. sharp .
and harvey ?
if you don &apos;t call yourself , i &apos;ll know .
you really are a dick , nathan .
i am , but when i give my word ,
the world knows that it &apos;s rock solid .
so , be there on time ,
get that shit done ,
or don &apos;t bother showing up at all .
♪ prune juice , prune juice you are so sweet ♪
♪ i love you all the way from my head down to my-- ♪
goddamn it !
hey , guy , what can you do for me ?
the name isn &apos;t guy , it &apos;s louis ,
and i had a two @-@ gallon bottle of
prune juice in the refrigerator .
i want to know where it went .
no problem . i had to toss that shit .
you threw away my prune juice ?
let me put it this way ,
if my asshole had an asshole ,
that &apos;s what it would smell like .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s supposed to smell like .
take it easy , bro , it &apos;s just prune juice .
no , it isn &apos;t just prune juice .
it &apos;s the sanctity of my kitchen .
and on top of my prune juice ,
you ate all of my bran bars .
you must spend a lot of time on the shitter .
that &apos;s neither here nor there .
you , sir , are in violation of subsection 3 @-@ c of your lease ,
which means if it happens again ,
you &apos;re out on your ass .
what ?
what kind of dildo puts bran bars and prune juice
in a lease agreement ?
this dildo . this dildo right here .
are you nuts ?
no . i &apos;m your worst nightmare ,
because this quivering angry dildo isn &apos;t going away
until it gets its satisfaction .
what did you just say to me ?
i just said ,
this dildo is gonna be in your face slapping it around ,
then up your ass marching you right out the door
if it catches you in violation of your lease ever again .
hello ?
rachel , it &apos;s professor dunbar .
how can i help you , professor ?
i tried to talk to you about this after class ,
but i was wondering if you &apos;d be interested in helping me
with something that &apos;s near and dear to my heart .
what &apos;s that ?
the innocence project .
you want me to help you get an innocent man off death row ?
that &apos;s exactly what i want .
this wouldn &apos;t have anything to do with the incident
after class the other day , would it ?
what makes you say that ?
because i can &apos;t do both of these things at the same time ,
and you know it .
okay , yes .
yes , i thought you might need a little relief ,
but i wouldn &apos;t be offering you this
if i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d earned it .
i appreciate that , professor , just ...
i &apos;m not one to back away from a fight .
rachel , i &apos;m not asking you to back away from a fight .
i &apos;m asking you to pick one that &apos;s more important .
well ?
well , what ?
did you grovel to per se to get yourself a reservation ?
i didn &apos;t grovel to per se .
i groveled to nathan .
but i don &apos;t want to talk about what i did .
i want to talk about what you did ,
because if you didn &apos;t file those motions
then i might as well cancel dinner .
i didn &apos;t just get them filed ,
i got the city attorney to put them on the top of the pile .
restraining order , patent infringement suit ,
tortious interference , and environmental hazard report .
lockwood isn &apos;t gonna know what hit them .
well , instead of patting yourself on the back ,
why don &apos;t you pick up the phone and get me sean cahill ?
she doesn &apos;t have to get you sean cahill ,
&apos;cause he &apos;s standing right in front of ya .
it &apos;s about time .
why the hell haven &apos;t you returned any of my phone calls ?
harvey , i need you to sit down .
sean , what took so long ?
it took me so long to find out
that frank gallo &apos;s not going anywhere
because he &apos;s got people up in high places
who are protecting him .
then tell me who they are . i &apos;ll put them in the ground .
look , it &apos;s not that simple .
it is to me .
harvey , you don &apos;t understand .
i understand that unless he &apos;s a government informant ,
we can get a criminal put back where he belongs .
you got to be kidding me .
look , i can &apos;t reveal details of a federal investigation .
you don &apos;t have to . you just did .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m telling mike what the hell &apos;s going on .
stop . just listen to me .
no one can know that this came from me .
no one &apos;s gonna know about it at all ...
except mike .
harvey , if you go to that prison now ,
you &apos;ll never make it back in time
for your dinner with nathan .
donna , i don &apos;t care what you have to do .
get him a message that i &apos;ll be an hour late ,
and make sure he says it &apos;s okay .
harvey--
take care of it .
i &apos;m not leaving mike alone in there another minute
without knowing what &apos;s coming .
harvey .
mike .
please tell me you came here with good news about gallo .
i have news , but it isn &apos;t good .
oh , shit .
mike , listen to me .
cahill wants to help , but his hands are tied .
what the hell does that mean ?
gallo &apos;s not here because of good behavior .
he &apos;s here because he cut a deal .
you got to be kidding me . he &apos;s a goddamn informant ?
yeah .
oh , that &apos;s great . so he &apos;s not going anywhere ,
and neither am i unless it &apos;s in a goddamn body bag !
mike , i &apos;m gonna find another way .
i &apos;d appreciate that , harvey ,
but what the hell am i supposed to do in the meantime ?
you didn &apos;t even want me to try
and get him out in the first place .
and i sure as hell didn &apos;t ask you
to put him in here in the first place .
and all the advice you gave me to stay in a group did
was get the only friend i have in here
nearly put in the hospital .
look , there &apos;s only one other thing i can think of ,
but you &apos;ll have to play it just right
or we &apos;re gonna make things worse .
well , you might as well say it ,
because from where i &apos;m standing ,
they are gonna get worse whether you tell me or not .
louis , can i talk to you for a second ?
what , no brah ?
no scrotum ? no dick nose ?
no , man , just plain old louis .
well , i consider myself a fair man .
what exactly do you have to say ?
i want to say i heard you before ,
and i didn &apos;t treat you or your office with any respect ,
and i &apos;m hoping we can have a fresh start .
that &apos;s wonderful .
i &apos;m touched .
now take this and get the hell out .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s an eviction notice .
i gave you a warning .
you screwed the pooch and now you &apos;re out .
are you kidding me ?
you come at me , i apologize to you ,
and then you do this ?
well , in between those two things ,
your traders were playing touch football
in my beloved bullpen ,
so i don &apos;t accept your bullshit apology .
you won &apos;t get away with this .
i already did .
you &apos;re a son of a bitch .
yeah , a son of a bitch who &apos;s got
the full weight of the new york city legal code on his side .
and you just learned lesson number one .
don &apos;t ever mess with a harvard goddamn lawyer .
excuse me , sir ?
relax , i know where i &apos;m going .
i &apos;m sure you do , but i don &apos;t think
you &apos;re going to find what you &apos;re looking for .
what did you just say to me ?
i &apos;m sorry , but you match the description of a man
i was told would be walking in here right about now .
and what exactly is the description ?
i &apos;d rather not say , but it fit you to a t.
so i &apos;m fairly confident you &apos;re the one
that was supposed to have dinner with nathan burns .
let &apos;s have it .
have what ?
the message you &apos;re supposed to give me .
he wanted me to tell you
that being late to dinner was a slap in the face ,
and you could take your offer and shove it up your ass .
goddamn it , donna , i told you to call nathan &apos;s office
and tell him i &apos;d be late .
don &apos;t &quot; goddamn it , donna &quot; me , i did call them .
well , he wasn &apos;t at the restaurant ,
so your message didn &apos;t get through .
i didn &apos;t leave a message , harvey .
i spoke to his secretary who i &apos;ve known for 12 years ,
and she said that nathan said it was okay .
then either he lied or she did ,
and it wasn &apos;t him because he may be an asshole ,
but as he likes to put it , his word is his bond .
unless somebody changed his mind .
what are you talking about ?
the only person who has the power to put pressure
on an asshole like nathan burns is a bigger asshole ,
and you said it yourself , william sutter will do anything
to get what he wants .
donna , i need you to get bill johnson at goldman ,
and i need you to do it right now .
i can &apos;t .
why the hell not ?
because he doesn &apos;t work there anymore .
oh , shit .
harvey .
donna , i need somebody who can tell me
if sutter &apos;s buying shares ,
and i need it before the market opens tomorrow .
then it &apos;s a good thing louis just rented our offices
to a bunch of traders .
oh , good , jessica , you &apos;re here .
i ... i had a few contracts i need to file .
i just need your signature .
you think i don &apos;t know you &apos;ve been
forging my signature on shit like this
for the last five years ?
i &apos;m sorry ...
no , you &apos;re not .
and you don &apos;t need to be .
you were just trying to save me some time .
now , why don &apos;t you tell me why you &apos;re really here ?
i ... i &apos;m taking a practical ethics course this semester .
well , it &apos;s been a long time since i read that textbook .
my problem &apos;s not with the textbook .
mike .
one of my classmates stuck him in my face
in front of the entire class to win an argument .
and the only thing you want to
stick in her face is your fist ?
something like that .
so the professor offered me an innocence project case ,
and i want to take it , but if i do ...
the other students will think you &apos;re afraid of her .
exactly .
then you have to make all of them afraid of you .
then the only impression they &apos;ll have of you
is that you &apos;re one badass woman .
why do i get the feeling that when you were in law school
you went through something just like this ?
rachel , i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve been paying attention ,
but i go through something like this every damn day .
i take it you &apos;re the man in charge .
what makes you think that ?
because you &apos;re still here ,
and the markets closed six hours ago .
maybe i &apos;m just here cheating on my girlfriend
with my secretary .
like i said , you &apos;re the man in charge .
i like you ,
but you didn &apos;t come all the way down to my office
just to kiss my ass , so why don &apos;t you just get to it ?
i need to know who just bought 5 % of this company .
well , that &apos;s gonna be a problem
because whoever it was doesn &apos;t have to file
with the sec for three months .
you &apos;re right , i didn &apos;t come down here to kiss your ass ,
but i didn &apos;t come for a refresher
on securities law either .
i &apos;m here because a guy like you can get me what i need .
and why should i help you ,
when i went to your partner on my hands and knees
and i &apos;m still gonna lose my lease
because i ate a couple of goddamn bran bars ?
you give me what i need , as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
you can throw every bran bar louis has off the roof .
i got a guy that can get you that information .
oh , no , no , no , no .
now that i know you got something to lose ,
i need you to make a little investment .
you serious about me sticking it to your partner ?
what do you think i &apos;ve been doing to him
for the last ten years ?
are you ready for round two ?
i am .
in fact , i think i already won ,
because one of the easiest things
to do in a debate is to attack the debater .
what is this ?
you went after me because of something that my fiancé did ,
but the truth is , we all have skeletons in our closets .
the difference between you and me
is that i don &apos;t care to use them .
what do you want ?
i think you know what i want .
shall we get started ?
i &apos;d like to apologize
for saying what i said to rachel zane .
i only did what i did
because she &apos;s my
intellectual and ethical superior .
i &apos;m ashamed of myself ,
and i forfeit this competition .
how &apos;d you get her to say that ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
what matters is , everyone here knows
that i &apos;m not afraid of her .
i take it that means you &apos;re staying in the class then ?
nope .
that is my official drop @-@ out request .
i &apos;m doing the innocence project .
what are you doing here , harvey ?
you didn &apos;t give me a chance to show you all the motions
i filed to keep that bastard out of your backyard .
because i told you if you were late for dinner
you could go screw yourself .
no , you didn &apos;t give me a chance to show you
because you &apos;re afraid of william sutter ,
when the person you should be afraid of is me .
what the hell are you talking about ?
you think i don &apos;t know
he bought a piece of you in the middle of the night ,
and now he &apos;s pressuring the board to kick you out ?
okay , fine .
he did , but i &apos;m a whale , and he &apos;s a shark ,
and i have no other choice .
i got a little news for you , nathan .
i got a piece of your company too ,
which means you either hire me
and we fight that bastard together ,
or you go with him and you take me on .
either way ,
you &apos;re not walking out of this thing without a war .
all i ever wanted was to work together ,
but i do not like being bullied .
no , you like to bully , which is exactly why
i never wanted to represent you in the first place .
you only came to me because you needed me .
you didn &apos;t care .
you &apos;re right , nathan , i didn &apos;t ,
but like you said , your word is your bond .
this is a chance for you to keep it ,
and maybe now we can actually start off on the right foot .
okay , harvey .
i &apos;m in .
two years , five months , 12 days .
i &apos;m not interested in hearing how long it &apos;s been
since you got laid .
no , that &apos;s exactly how long it &apos;s gonna be
until you walk out of here .
you trying to get me to attack you right here ?
because that &apos;s what &apos;s gonna happen .
i &apos;m just trying to tell you
that you &apos;re eligible for parole in six weeks .
bullshit .
you don &apos;t believe me ?
all right , take a look for yourself .
it &apos;s all right there .
you can read , right ?
yeah , i can read ,
but we &apos;re not all fake lawyers like you ,
so why don &apos;t you tell me what it is i &apos;m looking at ?
the time you served while awaiting trial
was never factored into your sentence .
your lawyer dropped the ball .
and why the hell would he do that ?
because of an arcane statute
that nine out of ten lawyers don &apos;t know about , but i do .
you think i don &apos;t know this is your protector &apos;s idea
to get me off your back ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s not gonna work .
no , frank .
harvey &apos;s idea was for me to tell these guys
that the real reason you &apos;re here
is because you &apos;re an informant .
you tell that to one living soul , i &apos;ll kill you .
i guess you have to decide
if you really want to spend the next two years
trying to mess with me
or salvage what &apos;s left of your life .
if you &apos;re really gonna pick getting back at harvey
over your own freedom ,
you really are the sorriest son of a bitch i &apos;ve ever met .
what the goddamn hell is going on in here ?
it &apos;s looking good , isn &apos;t it ?
okay , buddy , you just signed your death warrant .
i gave you 30 days , now you &apos;ve got 30 minutes .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s happening , boss .
not only are we staying ,
but we &apos;re making your beloved bullpen
the center of our operations ,
because your big bro amended our lease .
this is bullshit .
why the hell would harvey do that ?
let &apos;s just say i helped him out of a jam .
this isn &apos;t over , because whatever harvey did ,
he doesn &apos;t know contracts like i do .
and you don &apos;t know them like i know them ,
because this new lease is tighter than your mom &apos;s ass .
that &apos;s it . i am suing you for slander ,
because my mom &apos;s ass is miles from tight .
i &apos;ll take your word for it , bro , and bring it on ,
because you might be a harvard @-@ educated lawyer ,
but i &apos;m a yale @-@ educated lawyer ,
and the difference between me and you
is i know the real money &apos;s in trading .
now get the hell out of my bullpen .
harvey .
william .
i got something for you .
i assume it &apos;s an engagement letter for me to sign .
it &apos;s the sec form you &apos;re gonna have to file
for buying 5 % of nathan burns &apos;s company .
so you know .
i don &apos;t just know .
i bought a seat at the table ,
and i got nathan and the board on my side .
bullshit .
none of you have the balls to go up against me .
i &apos;m not here to go up against you , william .
i &apos;m here to buy your shares back at a tidy little profit
so you can use it to hire
whoever you want to be your lawyer
because it sure as hell isn &apos;t gonna be me .
yeah , maybe instead i &apos;ll make sure his company
gets in my pocket , never hires you ,
and your firm is out of business by the end of the quarter .
well , that &apos;s never gonna happen ,
because the only way to win this thing
is to get down in the mud ,
and if i was gonna be your lawyer ,
which i &apos;m never gonna be ,
i &apos;d tell you that &apos;s the last place you want to be
when you &apos;re staring down the barrel of an indictment .
you know you &apos;re making an enemy of me
for the rest of your life .
take a number , buddy , because one thing
i &apos;m never gonna do is get involved
with a shady piece of shit like you .
so you going to the movie ?
i wasn &apos;t planning on it .
it &apos;s pitch black . packed in .
gallo might try something .
i thought you said you had some way
to get him off our backs .
yeah , i don &apos;t know if it worked yet or not .
well , it doesn &apos;t matter , because movie night is sacred .
what do you mean ?
i mean it &apos;s one night that every guy in here
looks forward to , you know , doesn &apos;t want to mess up .
you try something in there , you &apos;re gonna end up
like my old roommate , mark higgins .
well , what &apos;s playing ?
&quot; crimson tide . &quot;
oh , you got to be kidding me .
well , you heard what i said about
the sanctity of movie night , right ?
besides , me , i never joke about denzel .
&quot; king kong ain &apos;t got shit on me !
we didn &apos;t land on plymouth rock . &quot;
&quot; plymouth rock landed on us . &quot;
shit .
what &apos;s this ?
that &apos;s your new job .
from now on you &apos;re doing kitchen duty with him .
and if i catch you doing the warden ,
you &apos;re going to solitary .
i didn &apos;t ask for kitchen duty .
maybe not , but i think i know who gave it to you .
i heard you went to see william sutter .
someone had to tell him to drop dead in person .
i thought we agreed we were gonna take him on .
that was before i made us legal counsel
for the largest energy producer on the east coast .
you signed nathan burns ?
i did .
well , i hope you know what you &apos;re doing , harvey ,
because we could have had them both .
jessica , i learned my lesson .
when you lie down with dogs , you come up with fleas ,
and i &apos;m telling you , we did the right thing .
then put some music on , because we &apos;re back on the map .
to being back on the map .
to drawing a new one .
should we get louis ?
aw , come on .
he takes one sip of this , we &apos;ll have to hear that story
about the first time he got laid .
we &apos;d be lucky if that &apos;s the story we get to hear .
wow , you guys are drinking ?
you haven &apos;t even heard my news yet .
you figured out a way to get gallo transferred ?
even better .
i figured out a way to get mike out early .
you &apos;re kidding me .
you think i came all the way down here to bullshit you ?
well , we all know there &apos;s no such thing as a free lunch ,
sean , so what &apos;s the catch ?
he has to inform on one of his fellow inmates .
what makes you think he can even get close to this guy ?
oh , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s gonna be a problem .
it &apos;s his roommate .
listen to me , mike &apos;s never gonna go for this .
so why don &apos;t you tell me what the hell you &apos;re talking about ?
kevin miller &apos;s a smoking gun on another case .
we tried to get him to turn on his family but he wouldn &apos;t .
mike gets him to turn or figures out
how to get what we need out of him anyway , he &apos;s free .
when do you need an answer by ?
yesterday .
and the answer needs to be yes .
