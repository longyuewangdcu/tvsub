the phoenix stone is stuffed full of very old vampire souls .
the stone gives the sword its power .
stefan ...
as long as i have this scar ,
rayna will hunt me .
what if i were to tell you there &apos;s a way
for me to transfer it
to somebody a little bit more deserving ?
i &apos;ll do the transfer spell .
that is downright noble .
right around the time elena wakes up ,
i &apos;ll be dead . so will you .
you &apos;ll never see her again .
so you &apos;re not taking the scar .
i have a plan !
how far a ...
we &apos;re too late because of you .
you &apos;d let him down and choose yourself .
we were happy while your brother was gone .
yes .
stefan , hey .
where &apos;s the damn sword ?
nora , don &apos;t !
there is no life without you .
i love you .
i &apos;m gonna save you , little brother .
i &apos;m gonna make this right .
come on .
help !
help !
help ...
easy .
breathe slow .
dizzy is normal .
and keep your foot off the ground ;
we &apos;re in a cold snap .
weather folks say temperature &apos;s a record low .
what &apos;s your name ?
i don &apos;t remember .
let &apos;s take a look at you .
whoever you are , you are one lucky s.o.b.
you &apos;re the first person i &apos;ve met to survive
a gash to the carotid .
take it from me :
even heroes can &apos;t save them all .
what &apos;d you just call me ?
a hero .
that &apos;s what those cheerleaders are saying , anyway .
i &apos;m keeping them at bay
until i &apos;ve ruled out concussive amnesia .
my name &apos;s stefan salvatore .
and there we go .
do you know where you are , stefan ?
yes .
i &apos;m in hell .
they didn &apos;t know .
didn &apos;t know what ?
that rayna had stabbed stefan .
that his spirit was already trapped in the phoenix stone .
they probably thought they were doing the world a favor .
well , that &apos;s awfully generous .
of you , not of them ,
considering they never gave a damn about anyone else
other than each other .
so if you &apos;re done mourning
thelma and mary louise ,
i think we should get out of here .
i &apos;m not going anywhere with you .
you could have prevented this .
all you had to do was take stefan &apos;s scar
and put your brother first , for once in your life .
i &apos;m trying to make it right .
which is why we have to find rayna
and get stefan &apos;s soul back in his body .
the stone is destroyed , damon .
and stefan with it .
we don &apos;t know that .
yes , we do ,
if we have logic and a sense of reason and a brain .
i see it differently , okay ?
if stefan &apos;s dead , then i &apos;m responsible .
which means i &apos;m going to spend the rest of eternity haunted
and doing penance
and seeing my own self @-@ loathing
reflected in everyone else &apos;s actual loathing .
and i &apos;m not ready for any of those things .
ergo ,
he &apos;s not dead .
try it my way .
it &apos;s less depressing .
i see i &apos;ve been charitable in assuming you have a brain .
you can keep being a debbie downer ,
or you can do a locator spell
and help me find rayna .
what do you say ?
where are you going ?
to do what you just told me to do .
without you .
invisique .
really ?
really ?
i don &apos;t get it .
my failed attempt at being a hero ,
the dead bodies ...
what &apos;s the lesson here ?
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m following you .
i remember being stabbed by the phoenix sword ,
which means this is all some sort of looping nightmare ,
custom @-@ made from my own psyche .
maybe i was a little hasty in my check @-@ up .
can you look straight ahead ?
i think i &apos;m fine , i &apos;m just ...
i &apos;m not in the mood for charades , all right ?
can we just skip to the torture , please ?
hey , officers !
why don &apos;t we just get on with it , huh ?
sit down .
you are not making any sense .
marty hammond ?
no ,
but okay .
that &apos;s what it says on this license .
i believe you , but that &apos;s not my wallet .
possible memory loss .
have you been drinking , sir ?
i get it .
i &apos;m a vampire with control issues
and alcoholism is a metaphor for my blood lust .
see , now we &apos;re getting somewhere .
sir , could you stand up for me ?
we going to a warmer hellscape ?
maybe .
first , i &apos;m gonna have to ask you to walk in a straight line .
hello ?
matt ... i need help .
rayna ?
you &apos;re the only person that i trust .
you put stefan back in the stone ?
yes , but ...
then we have nothing to talk about .
i did my part . i &apos;m out .
you don &apos;t understand .
those bitches destroyed the stone . he &apos;s free !
they &apos;re all free .
wait . what are you talking about ?
rayna ...
what do you mean , free ?
well ?
go ahead and answer him .
what do you mean , free ?
this is valerie .
and now , you speak .
valerie ...
i don &apos;t know why you took stefan &apos;s body ,
but if anything happens to ...
... my brother ...
never mind .
nice work , marty .
and back to me .
i can hear them .
all the voices ...
what are you talking about ?
they &apos;re coming from everywhere .
what is this supposed to prove ?
that you were under the influence when you were driving the bus .
what did you say ?
when you destroyed the phoenix stone ,
all the souls inside escaped .
scattered .
and i can hear them .
alive . every one of them .
you &apos;re saying that every vampire you ever killed with that sword
is now wandering the earth ?
what the hell happened to you ?
i &apos;m ... not sure .
i woke up in the middle of the road
and i saw the bus on fire .
yeah , you &apos;re a real hero , marty .
saving half the kids from the accident you caused ?
why do you keep calling me &quot; marty &quot; ?
i burned all their original bodies ,
which means the stone &apos;s prisoners are in random corpses .
vampire , human , it doesn &apos;t matter .
the spirits fled scattershot
into the first dead piece of flesh they could find .
remember anything ?
no .
nothing .
i &apos;m sorry ...
do i know you ?
i don &apos;t give a damn about a bunch of old vampire souls .
where did stefan end up ?
here you go .
and what if i refuse to take the test ?
then you &apos;re not giving me much of a choice .
rayna ...
where did stefan go ?
he could be anywhere .
he could be anyone .
marty hammond , you &apos;re under arrest
for driving under the influence ...
my name is stefan .
stop . calm down .
calm down , marty .
my name &apos;s stefan , damn it .
all right , you asked for it .
get back here ! stop ! stop !
turning now to a breaking news story ,
reports coming in of an accident on route 70,
near glenwood , arkansas ,
involving a dallas student charter bus .
at least four dead , with more injured ...
what the hell do you want ?
i &apos;m calling to warn you .
oh , it &apos;s a little late for that ,
don &apos;t you think ?
i mean , seeing as you seem to be working with that psycho
who took my fiancée hostage .
i know you &apos;re gonna find this hard to believe ,
but i made sure that caroline was safe .
safe ?
rayna shot a stake through her rib cage , matt .
listen to me , we were out .
three years , three years , no stabbings , no hostage swaps ,
no supernatural threat breathing down our neck , okay ?
we are getting married in a month .
we have got kids that we need to take care of .
look , caroline was bait .
to draw stefan out . that &apos;s all .
what the hell happened to you , man ?
look , something bad happened ,
and i &apos;m calling to warn you that i sent some visitors your way .
no , no , listen , caroline is in hiding with the girls ,
waiting for me .
this affects everybody , ric ,
and i &apos;m three states away .
i &apos;m hanging up right now .
it &apos;s like what happened with jo , only more random .
all the vampire souls from the phoenix stone
have found fresh corpses to inhabit .
some vampires , some not .
and why is this my problem ?
stefan is among the missing ,
and something tells me that your household
has a vested interest in whether he lives or dies .
okay .
what do we need to do ?
we have to hunt them all down .
no .
no , stefan has to be our first priority .
your boyfriend should be the least of your concerns .
what do you mean ?
you think i spent my life chasing harmless do @-@ gooders ?
that stone was made for the worst of the worst .
i &apos;ve put down some of the most evil vampires
of the last 200 years .
here .
flip through that .
what is this ?
it &apos;s your journal .
see if anything jogs your memory .
&quot; day 57 of being pissed off at my garbage heap of a brother ... &quot;
just @-@ just go ahead and read it to yourself .
look , the most important thing is , man ,
you &apos;re not in that hell anymore , all right ?
this is real .
and look , man , the truth is
you have every right to be pissed at me , okay ?
i screwed up bad , and when you remember why ,
i do not blame you ...
damon .
yeah .
i &apos;m famished .
okay , there you go .
need a refill ?
please .
and thank you .
okay , i think that &apos;s enough , stefan .
that &apos;s enough .
care to take her for a spin ?
better go make a quick phone call .
damon .
when did you realize jo wasn &apos;t jo ?
listen , are you with your brother right now ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m asking .
okay , damon , listen to me very carefully ,
that is not stefan , all right ?
we don &apos;t know who that is .
keep him close .
we &apos;re going to need his body .
so where the hell is stefan ?
uh , you know , it &apos;s not easy to pick him out from hundreds
of twitter reports about the zombie apocalypse , okay ?
we &apos;re working on it .
work harder .
i don &apos;t want to spend the rest of my life
babysitting a cheap knockoff of my brother .
oh , trust me , it &apos;s not gonna be the rest of your life .
jo &apos;s body started to break down
just as soon as that vampire soul inhabited her .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying that if stefan is in a human body ,
he &apos;s got about three days to live .
yes .
come on .
ah , yes .
for more on this story as it breaks , stay tuned .
the latest from arkansas ,
where , in the middle of an extreme weather warning ,
a manhunt is underway near the ouachita national forest .
marty hammond fled authorities
after allegedly causing a major accident on route 70 .
suspect has a previous dui .
we don &apos;t expect him to get too far .
he &apos;s a known drunk .
with his medical history ,
if the cold doesn &apos;t take him down , i &apos;m betting detox will .
but we &apos;ve got our best men on it ,
so people should just stay calm
and report any suspicious activities .
we &apos;re also taking volunteers to work our phone bank ,
so if you &apos;re interested , please contact the glenwood ymca
and lend us a hand .
thank you .
hammond , a former merchant marine ,
has been working for the charter bus company .
they have yet to release a statement .
but as news of hammond &apos;s substance abuse
continues to unfold ...
turn that down .
my head &apos;s about to explode .
... in light of his police record ...
tell me , what are they like ?
the voices ?
confused .
hungry , angry .
uh , do you see them ?
like with actual visions ?
pieces .
all at once , overlapping .
do you have any pictures of stefan ?
why would i have a picture of stefan ?
not you , caroline .
now , don &apos;t tell me she hasn &apos;t got
some bloody sentimental keepsake .
what are you doing ?
giving you something to focus on
while i help you sort though the noise .
here .
will this do ?
it &apos;s perfect .
all right .
here .
look into his eyes .
concentrate .
how is this supposed to ... ?
focus on stefan .
come on , stefan , where are you ?
i saw trees , blood , fire and an anchor .
wait , an anchor ?
a tattoo .
on his hand .
he &apos;s hurt . he &apos;s scared .
wait a second .
hammond , a former merchant marine ,
has been working for the charter bus company .
they have yet to release a statement .
a bus .
i saw a burning bus .
a merchant marine tattoo , a guy who saves a bunch of kids
and then goes on the lam .
i think this marty hammond is our guy .
arkansas ?
what the hell &apos;s in arkansas ?
miles of national forest , dozens of pissed @-@ off state troopers ,
and a rapidly approaching blizzard .
how soon can you get there ?
well , that depends on how cooperative my passenger &apos;s gonna be .
all right , brother .
time to go .
not a minute too soon .
this place is dead .
yeah .
come on .
oh , of course .
of course i &apos;m trapped in the body of an addict .
didn &apos;t need a damn hell @-@ stone to hammer that irony home ,
did we , marty ?
you know , marty ,
i spent the last three years knowing
my life span was tied to rayna &apos;s .
after the initial shock wore off ,
i actually started to enjoy it .
i had an expiration date .
that &apos;s as close to being human as i was ever gonna get .
i guess i forgot how much being a human actually sucks ,
how everything hurts ...
all the damn time .
ah , come on ...
ah , come on .
yes ! yes !
suck on that , marty , you miserable drunk .
yes .
yes , i think it &apos;s starting to come back to me .
the pain , the doleful humdrum of my eternal curse .
and yet , here and there , moments of hope .
glimmers of humanity .
i may have forgotten what you &apos;ve done , damon ,
but i do remember this :
you are my flesh and blood .
i love you , brother .
cut the crap , buddy .
i know you &apos;re not stefan .
aw , that &apos;s a shame .
i was just warming up .
i give you points for being a quick study .
i can &apos;t take all the credit ; you did give me the handbook .
in all seriousness though ,
your brother truly , truly hates you .
listen to this , &quot; i have resigned myself
to never seeing damon again in my now @-@ finite lifetime ,
and i have never felt so unburdened . &quot;
oof , sounds like he doesn &apos;t care if he ever sees you again .
which is perfect ,
because i don &apos;t plan on giving up this body .
well , fair warning ,
that hair requires a tremendous amount of maintenance .
indeed , it does .
better than nothing though .
how far is memphis ?
memphis ?
please tell me your name was elvis .
it would explain a lot .
you seem like an entertaining fellow , damon .
well ...
when this is all over ,
we should go carousing together .
deuces .
wait !
wait , what do you mean , you lost him ?
i mean he figured out stefan &apos;s body is a time @-@ share ,
and he ran .
he asked about memphis .
memphis ?
we &apos;re two states away from memphis .
and i have to go rescue the real stefan from a manhunt .
you have a heretic and a huntress .
use them .
it &apos;s okay .
i can track stefan &apos;s body .
did you say memphis ?
we have to catch him .
well , that &apos;s the point , isn &apos;t it ?
and then what ?
and then kill him , that &apos;s what you &apos;re not saying .
who is he ?
just another serial killer
that cannot be allowed to walk this earth .
he should be staked and burned and sent to oblivion .
well , he is walking this earth in my boyfriend &apos;s body ,
so we &apos;re not killing anyone .
then this is where we part ways .
i &apos;m dying to know what &apos;s in that case you keep inching towards .
it &apos;s a dart gun .
think it &apos;ll help ?
excuse me , miss ?
do you know where we are ?
are you lost ?
the storm is moving in quicker than expected .
yeah .
and out of gas .
and naturally unlucky .
authorities urge everyone to stock up on needed provisions
you mind if i borrow your phone ?
and to get out the snow chains because road conditions
it &apos;s just one quick call .
will deteriorate quickly .
hang on .
breaking news--
a male fugitive is on the run in the greater glenwood area .
the man is considered dangerous .
residents in and around ouachita are advised
to report any suspicious activity in the area . again .
get away from me !
i just need to use your phone .
please .
pardon me . excuse me .
officer coming through .
i need you to call these four guys back
for another shift .
i need the man @-@ power .
hold on , i &apos;ll be back .
sir ?
sir ?
who are you ?
i &apos;m a volunteer , deputy matt donovan ,
mystic falls .
a friend to my brothers in blue .
i never heard of mystic falls .
never heard of you .
where &apos;s your badge ?
you don &apos;t need to see a badge ,
because matt donovan is the finest , bravest ,
least stupid cop you ever met .
and if anyone asks ,
that &apos;s the lie you tell them .
glad you &apos;re here , donovan .
we &apos;re lucky to have you .
so what &apos;s the status ?
well , hammond is screwed any way you cut it .
we got the forest surrounded .
boys just raided a cabin , found traces of blood
but no marty , which means that ...
he &apos;s alone in those woods .
and nobody can survive these temperatures overnight .
we &apos;re just laying low .
gonna wait for nature to do our work for us .
didn &apos;t think that one through , did you , brother ?
what do you say we get out of here ,
get you back in your own body ?
let &apos;s go .
what ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
this .
you .
if you &apos;re here , then i &apos;m safe , and i owe you one .
but if you &apos;re a hallucination ,
then i &apos;ve entered the delirium phase of my withdrawal ,
and i &apos;m officially and royally screwed .
currently 2 degrees and dropping fast .
with snowfall of a foot or more projected ,
road closures and downed power lines should be anticipated .
all right , try to calm down and tell me what happened .
i saw him . he attacked me .
ok . all right , here have a seat right here .
hey , you &apos;re safe now , ma &apos;am .
thank you .
if it &apos;s okay with you , captain , i &apos;d like to question her myself .
all right .
all right , everyone .
matt donovan &apos;s got this .
i need you to tell me exactly where you saw him .
yeah . it was an access road off of 274 .
it was north of oden .
there &apos;s an outlook there .
and you &apos;re sure it was north ?
yeah .
all right , boys . he &apos;s south of of oden .
let &apos;s pull all troops down to that area , okay ?
wait , that &apos;s not what i said .
it is now .
you saw him south of oden .
hey , let me know if they find my phone .
what &apos;d you say ?
my cell phone .
hello ?
marty &apos;s voice is , uh ,
huskier than i imagined .
damon .
sure picked a great night to get lost in the woods .
yeah , well , at least i &apos;m starting to warm up .
which , in case you didn &apos;t know , is a bad sign .
you gotta move , okay ?
just pick a direction , start walking .
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t even feel my legs .
at this point , i can &apos;t tell
if the tremors are from my withdrawal
or from me freezing to death .
stefan , just get up .
this is not how you are going to die , stefan salvatore .
alone in the wilderness ,
trapped in the frozen corpse of an alcoholic murderer ?
uh , i don &apos;t know .
seems kind of fitting to me .
come on .
give me something to work with , here .
day late and a dollar short .
you suck at playing hero , brother .
well , i guess i &apos;m just not used to you
being such a damsel in distress .
should i list all the ways
in which this mess is your fault ?
sure , stef .
go for it . i &apos;m not doing anything important right now .
you bailed on me , damon .
listen , valerie and i were literally
just about to do the transfer spell .
even before that .
you bailed on me
when you decided you &apos;d rather live in a coffin
than own up to your mistakes .
no . no , no .
i was trying to prevent myself
from making mistakes , stefan .
and why is that so hard for you , damon ?
don &apos;t say &quot; elena . &quot;
you lived 160 years before you met her .
i got ripped out of hell
and thrown into a dead man &apos;s body .
and do you know what my first thought was when i came to ?
&quot; i need to save those people on the bus . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know who i was ,
i didn &apos;t know where i was--
it was my instinct .
where are your instincts , damon ?
what does the voice in your head say ?
you want me to say what we both already know ?
fine .
i &apos;m selfish .
i &apos;m angry .
i am impatient .
and yes , until i met elena ,
i wasn &apos;t interested in doing the right thing for anybody .
your brother included .
my brother included .
you mad ?
yes .
you resent me ?
yes .
good .
then get up and come kick my ass yourself .
stefan ...
i &apos;m walking .
you want to know why this is so hard ?
because marty hammond is a total train wreck ?
because , eventually ,
i &apos;m not gonna be able to go on .
and when that happens ,
i don &apos;t believe you &apos;ll be there .
must we wait this out ?
well , unless you want to end up in a ditch off the freeway ,
we &apos;re gonna spend the night right here .
how convenient for you .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
well , if this ends badly ,
you emerge the victor .
stefan dies through no fault of your own .
less competition for your fiancée &apos;s heart .
how insecure do you think i am ?
don &apos;t pretend it hasn &apos;t crossed your mind .
i am very familiar with the sensation
of watching stefan and caroline from the outside .
well , except for the part where stefan ditched caroline
to travel around the world with you .
you see , i never fooled myself into thinking
that what i had with stefan would last .
but you ... you put a ring on it .
yeah , i proposed to caroline ,
because i fell in love with her .
and she said yes
because it made sense for the kids .
so , yeah ...
stefan coming back might ruin my perfect little life .
so what ?
well , for what it &apos;s worth ,
i &apos;m rooting for you and caroline .
why , how selfless of you .
ah , don &apos;t tell me you don &apos;t appreciate the irony of this .
you being human .
well , safe to say i do not appreciate it
at this particular moment .
tell me , though ,
what &apos;s the worst part about being human ?
is it ... is it leg cramps ?
is it sniffles ?
frostbite ? what is it ?
how about the inability to compel people ?
yeah .
yeah , that &apos;s a big one .
sucks having to play by the rules , doesn &apos;t it ?
like you would know .
you remember playing hide @-@ and @-@ seek when we were kids ?
you bring that up because you used to cheat ?
i did not .
absolutely , you did .
you used to hide in father &apos;s office ,
even though we weren &apos;t allowed to be in there .
once , maybe .
no .
all the time .
then why was it so hard for you to find me ?
&apos;cause i was scared .
i didn &apos;t want to break the rules .
maybe you were hoping father would catch me and punish me .
no , i wasn &apos;t scared i &apos;d get caught .
i was scared for you , stefan .
why do you bring up hide @-@ and @-@ go @-@ seek ?
because you &apos;re never gonna find me .
damon ...
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
it &apos;s all very normal .
are those ...
cop @-@ approved .
you asked me what i missed most about being human .
the ecstasy of eating this ...
incredibly crappy donut .
so all &apos;s forgiven ?
not by a long shot .
what is it ?
about that ...
afraid marty &apos;s not gonna make it .
buckle up .
we have less than 48 hours to track down your real body .
are you still tracking stefan &apos;s body ?
whoever &apos;s in him just stopped .
in memphis .
i can hear music , it &apos;s ...
a fraternity house .
wait , a @-@ a vampire just beelined to memphis
and went straight to a university ?
we gotta go .
why ?
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s something that rayna said .
it reminded me of an old wives &apos; tale
about a string of murders
that happened in memphis in the 1880s .
apparently he was a serial killer
before he became a vampire .
he would stalk sororities and fraternities
and murder for sport .
libations ?
nice .
come on in , man .
as the story goes , he wouldn &apos;t just kill .
he would force his victims to murder each other .
and they would tell the story ,
but no one would believe them .
eventually the burden would drive them mad .
they never caught the killer .
