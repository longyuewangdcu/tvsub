Alaric's babies are the future of the coven.
They would have protected them in any way they could.
They're inside of you.
Then why are you here, Lorenzo?
I'm here because of you.
Who's Julian?
He was the love of my life.
Your grandchild was murdered by Julian.
We bound Julian's life to mine.
We're linked. If he dies, so do I.
Our mother faked her death,
left her sons behind, started a new family,
and went out of her way to forget us forever!
As far as I'm concerned,
she deserves what she gets.
Did you know Valerie was once
pregnant with Stefan's child?
Valerie? No.
I love you, darling.
I will never hurt you.
You were right about Julian,
but I am not going to let him hurt us anymore.
I have a plan, and this time, we won't get caught.
Where am I?
That's right, Dallas.
The home of big hair and horrible presidents.
And the trap you just walked into.
Unfortunately, you're not the fly I was hoping to catch.
Oh, so, the mystery guest makes an appearance.
Why don't you do me a favor?
Come a little closer so I can sort of see you.
Mom?
It's been a long time.
What's the plan?
Julian needs to die today.
Everything has to appear to be normal.
Julian's not an idiot.
If he finds out that Lily turned on him, we're all dead.
So you embed her with a psychopath.
Sounds logical.
Hey, don't look at me; I voted to drive
a stake through her heart and get rid of this
Julian mama drama once and for all.
But, hey, complicated plan "A" Sounds like a happy compromise.
It's not complicated.
We get Julian's blood, and then, Nora,
Beau, or Mary Louise use it
to unlink him from Lily, and we kill the bastard.
Uh, you glossed over the important bit.
Do you really think that Beau, Mary Louise,
and Nora are going to help?
Okay. That's it.
Nora is off pancake duty.
Me? You're the one who wanted the chocolate chips to melt.
Melt, not burn the house down and kill us all--
Nobody's killing anybody before we eat.
I'm not wasting any of this food.
Darling. We woke you.
Aren't we having fun?
Julian treats Lily's heretics
like they're his own royal children.
And they worship him right back; they'll never turn on him.
The old stake through the heart's lookin' like
a pretty good alternative right now.
Just sayin'.
Well, I guess the only way we're gonna be able to pull this off
is to deploy the nuclear option.
Which is?
Me.
I know how to win them over to our side.
Uh, great, yeah. Last I checked,
she was the black sheep of the family.
What are you gonna tell them to make them feel otherwise?
The truth.
This looks like quite the feast. What's the occasion?
Don't tell me you forgot.
Forgot what?
It's our anniversary.
Mary Lou and I have been together for 133 years.
Of course she remembered.
In fact,
it was Lily's idea to host your party tonight.
Really?
Lily Salvatore throws a party?
Let me guess, we'll get drunk on tea and do needlepoint.
Oh, yes, nothing says
"I've loved you for over a century"
like falling asleep by 9:15.
Girls, girls, girls, girls,
you're underestimating us.
I think they're in for a wonderful surprise,
don't you, my love?
Yes.
Yes, quite the surprise.
"Dear Elena, I'm pregnant."
"Ridiculously long story short,
they're Ric and Jo's twin babies,
magically transported into my readily available womb
by the Gemini coven.
I guess I thought writing to you might help me figure out
how I'm supposed to feel about the whole thing
because on one hand, I know how much this means to Alaric,
and on the other,
I have no idea what it means for me."
Breaking news.
Remember all those people Julian was stockpiling?
They disappeared this morning.
That's weird. Where did they go?
That's what I'm working on.
You want to cut class today and help me get to the bottom of it?
Actually, I can't.
I'm...
turns out Valerie was right.
Wait. You're really pregnant?
Yup.
How'd Stefan take it?
Oh, you know,
totally supportive and
just wanted to make sure that I was ok.
At least, that's how I'm hoping it goes when I tell him today.
What are you doing here, Lorenzo?
Oh, looking for the self-help section.
Seems I've developed, um, feelings
for someone with terrible taste,
and yet...I can't seem to shake her.
I need to get something
for Nora and Mary Lou's anniversary.
Nora used to read this poem
over and over again when we were trapped together.
I believe it was called "The nymph's reply to the shepherd."
"But could youth last and love still breed,
"had joys no date, nor age no need,
"then these delights my mind might move
"To live with thee
And be thy love."
I had no idea you enjoyed poetry.
Well, there's a lot about me that you haven't...
allowed yourself to know.
The poems of Sir Walter Raleigh,
a proper Englishman.
Oh, this looks like a decent edition.
Do you really think some bauble will convince the heretics
to side with you over an evil step-daddy
who spoils them rotten with ponies and ice cream?
I don't have a choice.
Yes, you do.
Run. Leave town with me.
Let your sons carry out their plan
while you're off the grid.
Oh, Lorenzo...
I can't run from this.
This is my doing.
You're not safe.
Come with me.
You know I can't do that.
But if you could...
If I could...
Good luck, Lily.
You'll need it.
I can't see a bloody thing.
That's the point.
Julian. Enough games.
As you wish.
This is epic.
Who are all these people?
Friends, food, whatever you want them to be.
They've all been compelled to see to your every desire.
But there are so many.
I've been collecting them for this very occasion.
Are you ill?
Lily would never allow this.
Come on. It's your anniversary.
Let's have a drink to celebrate.
What is going on here?
Loosen up, darling. It's a party.
The rule is we may feed on trespassers.
One here, maybe another there, but
where did all these people come from, Julian?
They certainly didn't bus themselves in to be our dinner.
See? I told you she was incapable of fun.
Come on. Let's go before she ruins our entire night.
However...
I suppose, since it's a special occasion,
we can make an exception.
See? Just like old times.
Damon.
Lily just texted me their location. Let's do this.
I, uh, thought you were studying.
I was, but I'm here now. Surprise.
Ah, Stefan distraction machine.
Please tell me you're not coming.
Coming where?
Nora and Mary Louise's anniversary.
Great. You're here, too.
That's...perfect.
Uh, what are--what are you doing here?
I'm...
Spit it out, blondie.
You know what? Damon and I will go together.
Stefan can follow behind.
What? No.
Yes. Let's go.
What was that all about?
We need to talk.
I know, it's insane.
Magical baby transplants? I...
I didn't believe it, either, but then I
ate 9 ice cream sundaes from noon to 3:00,
and none of my clothes fit, and then there was
that whole part with the doctor and the ultrasound, so...
Right.
Yeah.
You can say something.
Uh, I don't think there are any words.
I know.
I know.
I have to go.
What?
I mean, obviously we need to talk about this, um,
but...we have this small window
to get to Julian tonight, and this is sort of...
Bad...timing? I mean, trust me, I get it.
No, no, no, it's...
I mean, yes, it--yes,
um, but we will talk about it when I get back.
Ok.
Promise.
Where are you taking me?
Quiet. I need your opinion.
Do you think she'll say yes?
She loves you. She would have said yes
when it would have gotten her beheaded.
Why am I so nervous?
Probably because the love of your life is far too vain
to be wearing whatever that tiny little rock is,
reflecting light in that box.
Lily doesn't allow us to leave Mystic Falls, so
my options were limited to coal-miner chic.
A relationship as beautiful as yours
deserves something a little better.
This belonged to French royalty.
A, uh, princess, I think.
She was telling me as she lost her head.
It's perfect.
Oh, the perfect ring for the perfect couple.
I'm so happy for you both.
This is what I read to everyone in that horrible prison world.
I thought it'd be a nice anniversary gift.
It reminds me of everything
we've been through together as a family.
Thank you, Lily.
This is so special. I love it.
Guess who.
The man I chose above all others.
I'll leave you two lovebirds alone.
Dance with me.
I have no idea how to dance to this kind of music.
No, no, no, fear not.
I bribed the deejay to play us a slow song.
Do you recognize it?
Should I?
Not the arrangement, but perhaps the vocals.
I'll never forget that voice.
He used to sing so beautifully.
To think of everything we've endured as a family...
and now we're together,
at long last.
Like old times.
Well, almost like old times.
You haven't been indulging in any of the real fun.
No, I'm perfectly content with blood bags.
No, no, you're afraid.
Afraid of what?
Going all in...
and rejoining our family completely.
You keep holding on to the hope
that Stefan and Damon will love you again,
that we'll be one big happy family, but we can't, hmm?
And that hope is causing unwanted friction.
Take a look around.
You have all the love that you need right here.
All you have to do is accept it.
Come back to us, Lily.
Let go and allow yourself to be the woman
that I fought through hell for.
Looks like someone's having fun.
I had to feed.
I have to convince them that I'm on their side.
Sounds like something straight out of rippers anonymous.
Plan's postponed till further notice.
No, no, no, no, look.
Valerie will get through to them. The plan must go forward.
I can't spend another minute with that man.
Fine.
Julian dies tonight,
but it's no skin off my back if you're still linked
to the guy when I shove a stake through his heart.
Yes, you made that perfectly clear
when you tried to kill him yesterday.
What do you want from me, an apology?
Ain't gonna happen. I'm only here because Stefan's a mommy's boy.
I don't want the silent treatment for the next century--
I am your mother.
How can you be so cavalier about my life?
Because you're already dead to me, Lily.
I was 17. You went away. I cried.
I grew up. You being here doesn't change any of that.
If I had to do it all over again, I'd have left you
in that damn prison world
so that I didn't have to see your face again.
Mare.
This is gorgeous. Did you do all this?
Mostly.
Julian and Beau helped.
What's that?
A gift for us.
"But could youth last and love still breed,
Have joys no date, nor age no need"--
Marry me.
133 years is not enough, Nora.
I want eternity.
Yes.
Really?
Yes. Of course, yes.
I'm happy for you two.
What are you doing here,
besides destroying the greatest moment of my life?
We need to talk
about the worst moment of mine.
Let her go.
Oh, so, so sorry, officer.
I found this one wandering about
and assumed she was of, uh...Drinking age.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Well, let's just say I didn't get the girl.
I don't think the life-saving business suits you, mate.
Yeah, why don't you tell that to the girl
whose throat you were about to tear out?
Mmm, yeah, well,
I suppose that brings your tally to a whopping one.
Damon didn't want you,
Lily didn't want you,
and this town never wanted you,
so what are you still doing here?
I might ask the same thing about you.
The heretics are throwing a murder party
in your precious hometown,
and all you can manage to stop
is my buzz!
You're overmatched.
You've brought a knife to a gunfight,
and it's gonna be the death of you.
This is so typical.
Nora and I have one night a year,
and Valerie can't stop herself from trying to steal the spotlight.
This isn't about me.
It's about our family.
Hold on. Where's Julian?
We should wait for him.
Julian won't be joining us.
Hell of a party.
Well, your mother would agree.
There's a kindergarten teacher in the powder room to prove it.
Oh, good old mom.
Bet she made you think she enjoyed it, too, huh?
His face went cold.
I couldn't fight him off.
I couldn't--I couldn't stop him.
Julian beat me savagely
and...when it was finally over,
my baby was dead.
Murdering my child wasn't just some violent whim.
It was a calculated, manipulative act.
What are you boys doing here?
It's an anniversary party; guess we figured we'd
come support the pretty one and her mean girlfriend.
This doesn't make any sense.
Why would Julian do such a thing? What did he stand to gain?
Me.
I would have never gone to Europe with him
had I known about my grandson.
Grandson?
Stefan was the baby's father.
I couldn't cope.
I took my own life and became the first heretic.
And when Julian saw how powerful I was, he wanted more.
We're his army, we're not his family.
We always have been.
Lily... is that true?
I believe every word Valerie said.
When she told me what happened to her, it was
as if all the lights in the room went on...
And I could finally see Julian for who he really is.
That's why I'm leaving him.
She can't do it without your help,
so the question is... who do you believe?
Mare. You heard what she said. What are you waiting for?
Sorry. It's just this is a lot to take in.
That's why we stick together.
We're family.
Beau, give me your hand.
What is she doing?
Bracing herself.
For what?
Lily, you're bleeding.
It's about to get a lot worse.
Let's tie him up.
Damon's tying up Julian right now.
I, uh, got his blood.
Good.
They're waiting for it in the greenhouse.
Caroline's pregnant.
Yeah, I didn't really know what to say, either.
Do I even want to know how this happened?
Gemini spell.
Twins.
Not mine, obviously.
You must be overwhelmed.
Well, I didn't exactly, um,
handle things the right way.
Any advice?
Tell her you love her.
Never forget what she must be going through.
And then, one day...
be prepared for her to sacrifice everything for them.
Not that I'm one to give advice.
I chose Julian over everything.
Yeah, but now he's gonna die,
and you can start over without him.
It's too late,
And so much has already been lost.
You haven't lost me.
Really?
I guess, uh...
willingness to forgive the unforgivable
is in my genetics.
And unfortunately, Damon...
doesn't feel the same way about forgiveness.
Look, you were the first woman to break his heart.
He's put up a wall ever since.
But...You can take it down.
No.
He's gone.
I saw it in his eyes.
He-he wishes me dead.
Do you think that I haven't seen that look before?
Damon has been practicing that look on me
for the last 150 years.
Well, then maybe you could offer your mother
a little advice in return.
How do I get him back?
Time.
And my mind is boggled
by this blind devotion you have for Lily,
when the woman mused up an idea
to keep you away from your soulmate for what,
60 years, 70 years?
Stop talking.
And yet here you are,
essentially risking your life to be here
with me in order to keep her alive.
Don't listen to him. He knows he's dead either way.
But if he can provoke you to kill him now,
then you spend eternity as the boy who killed his own mother.
Mmm, aren't you a clever girl?
It's a shame.
I suppose your little one would have had the same smarts...
Rot in hell, Julian.
What is this?
Apparently whoever wins at foosball gets to kill me.
It's pinball, and I have the high score.
Did you break that link yet?
How do I know
that you were pregnant with Stefan's child?
Are you testing me?
Do you really believe that I would make that up?
You lied to Lily about your affair with Stefan,
just like you lied to us about killing Oscar,
So why should I believe that you're telling the truth now?
All right, Nancy Grace, enough.
Let the adults handle this.
What are you doing?
And that, Mary Louise,
is why you've always been my favorite.
Well, you're either really drunk
or calling to tell me that you found a new girlfriend.
None of the above.
Although a drink does sound really good right about now.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Listen, I'm really sorry about earlier.
I didn't know what to say, and
I didn't want to say the wrong thing, so I just...
bailed.
Well, I guess there's no right thing to say
when you find out your girlfriend is
magically pregnant with another man's babies.
Look, I know
that this is happening to both of us.
And you stood by me through...
everything I went through with my mom,
So I totally get it if you want to run for the hills.
I'm not going anywhere
Because I love you.
I guess there is a right thing to say after all.
Listen, no matter how...
Weird this all gets... I'm here for you.
We're gonna get through this together.
Are you sure? 'cause it could get really weird.
I'm positive.
Ok.
I love you, too.
Mare.
Hey. Where are you going?
We still need to unlink Lily.
I have to get out of here.
Mare, stop.
You've been crying.
What happened?
Oh, my god.
Things have grown out of hand, Lily.
Enough is enough.
What are you doing? Let them go.
I can't
'cause if I do,
This bloody cycle will continue.
And I love you-- and the family that we Have built together--
far too much for that to happen.
So...
One lives, one dies.
You have to choose which.
I will do no such thing.
Oh, but you will.
You have spent far too long trying to have it all.
The lies, the-- the violence,
all because you wanted the impossible.
Well, the truth is,
you're either a Salvatore
or you're one of us,
but you cannot be both.
Now choose.
Choose.
How could you do that to Lily?
How could Valerie have done what she has to us?
She hasn't been truthful about anything, Nora.
Her relationship with Stefan? Lies.
Killing Oscar? More lies.
This is different.
Of course you would think that.
He took her child from her,
and you would side with him?
And you would side with a girl who murdered her own brother?
No. What are you doing?
This doesn't represent our love,
it represents Julian's ability to manipulate us.
I don't want it.
Nora, please--
I don't want any of it.
Nora. Nora!
This isn't you.
This is not the man that I fell in love with.
You used to be kind,
gentle, funny.
No, no, you--you're still in shock
from the hell that you've been trapped in for so long.
Hell didn't turn him evil, Lily.
He was born this way.
Ok, this vervain stings like a bitch,
and your family drama makes the prospect of hell
look like Disneyland.
So, please,
one swift stab straight through the heart.
Let's get this over with.
You chose your heretics over Stefan and me
every chance you had. Why stop now?
Lily, please.
You are such a strong girl.
I am so sorry I didn't see it sooner.
My son...
Please forgive me.
Kill me!
Come on. Do it, Lily.
You're wrong about so many things.
I never had the courage to tell you before...
But I do now.
You...are wrong, Julian.
I can choose them both.
No! Lily!
Lily.
Lily.
My sweet, foolish girl.
I've already unlinked us.
No.
Lily!
Save your strength. You're full of vervain.
You couldn't break out of here on your best day.
What the hell did you do?
I took your advice.
You see, you're right.
I can't protect Mystic Falls on my own,
So I made some friends who could help.
Who are these friends?
Sorry, I can't tell you.
See, they'd like to introduce themselves.
I guess I was wrong.
Someone wanted you after all.
The splinters must be inside your heart.
I can't-- I can't get them out.
Nora... It's all right.
What do I do?
Tell me what to do!
You say good-bye.
We wouldn't be a family without you, Lily.
I love you.
I am so sorry this happened.
Good-bye.
I guess...
only one of us
gets the luxury of time.
Promise me you'll use yours
to the fullest.
Nora gave me back the ring.
What is all this?
Lily, uh...
she staked herself in her heart.
What?
She thought that killing herself would kill me.
She didn't realize that you had already unlinked us.
I thought breaking the spell would protect her.
If her sons succeeded in killing me...
She would be spared, but it's--
No. No. Tell me this isn't real.
Tell me this isn't happening!
She's gone, Mary Louise. She's gone.
I forgive you for loving him, Lily.
You just wanted to love us all.
There's no sin in that.
She only has moments left.
Make the most of them.
Damon.
I'm truly sorry.
Say something.
You made your bed.
Have a nice nap.
Mom?
Are you still here?
I'm so sorry. I don't think I can save you.
You've been poisoned with werewolf toxin.
Without proper treatment,
you will die soon.
Okay, mom, listen.
Why are you still here?
There is something that's been nagging of me for
a long time.
I'm so sorry.
Mom?
You must really be having a bad trip.
You mother's been dead for years.
You are not my mother?
