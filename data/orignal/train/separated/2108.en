It looks like our first female competitor
is about to hit the beach.
Bring it on in, Jen!
Jen, you got it.
Ladies and gentlemen, here she comes.
After nearly six grueling hours of paddleboarding,
let's give a big aloha
to Honolulu's very own Jen Hassley!
Way to go, Jen.
Folks, you've just been witness to history.
With an official time of five hours, 52 minutes
and 47 seconds, at 15 years old,
Jen Hassley's just become the youngest
female competitor to win
the Molokai to O'ahu Paddleboard World Championship.
How you feeling?
Great, Mom.
Okay. Are you sure?
Yes. Yes.
Nothing to worry about. I'm fine.
Okay
Give her a few minutes.
She'll be back to answer all your questions.
I'm going to go rinse off.
I'll meet you at the medal ceremony.
All right.
That's our little girl.
And finally, the moment we've all been waiting for,
in first place, with a time of five hours,
52 minutes and 47 seconds,
Jen Hassley!
Jen Hassley.
Jen Hassley to the podium, please.
Why don't you go check the changing tent?
Okay.
Jen?
Jen?
Jen?
Honey, where are you?
Jen?
Jen?
Mom!
Mom!
Jen!
Jen! No!
Mom!
Mom...
Somebody help! Please!
They took my daughter!
Yes, sir.
Okay. I'll let him know.
I'm sorry, Commander.
The governor will be with you in a few minutes.
Mahalo.
Hello. Officer Lori Weston here to see the Governor.
Thank you, Officer Weston.
The governor will be with you shortly.
Thanks.
I have, uh, clearly been here for a while.
You want the sports section? I already read it.
Yeah. Sure.
Thank you.
I'm Steve McGarrett, by the way.
Hi. Lori Weston.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Commander McGarrett.
Officer Weston.
The governor will see you now.
Together?
Yes. Follow me.
Come in. Come in. Have a seat.
All right.
Commander, have you met
Officer Weston from Homeland Security?
Yes, we, uh... we just met.
Yes, sir.
Sir, does this have anything to do
with Victor Hesse's murder?
No. I called you here for a different reason.
Have a seat.
Commander, I thought you and I had an understanding.
When I told you there was going to be accountability,
I wasn't saying it just to hear myself speak.
Um, I'm... I-I don't know what you mean, sir.
You let a dangerous felon go last week in hopes
that he would lead you to Wo Fat.
You thought you could slip that one by me, didn't you?
With all due respect, sir, the objective
is to catch Wo Fat, not the little fish under him.
With all due respect, Commander,
you broke my trust.
And there's going to be
consequences for that, as I said there would be.
What kind of consequences?
Officer Weston.
Sir.
I'm sure you thought,
coming here, you were going to be appointed
my new public safety liaison,
but actually, I have a different position in mind for you.
Wait a minute.
Sir, if this has something to do...
That's right.
Officer Weston, welcome to Five-O.
Sir, we're not really recruiting new people right now.
No offense.
None taken.
Commander, you're going to find Officer Weston to be
an incredible asset to you and your team.
She spent six years
with Homeland Security as a profiler.
Sir, I actually really do appreciate...
If this is about
you thinking of me...
replacing Officer Kalakaua...
for this position...
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
I'm not looking to be a babysitter.
Time-out! Time-out!
Babysitter?
Time-out.
This is not about Officer Kalakaua,
and I'm not asking you to babysit.
I'm asking you to be a part of a team
that is vital to this state's safety.
And frankly, I am not asking; I'm telling.
I need to take this.
Then you should take it.
Excuse me.
McGarrett.
Yeah, go ahead.
Yeah. I'll be right there.
Okay, there's been a kidnapping, so, uh, I have to go.
Then get on it.
Sir, I really don't...
What are you still doing here?
You've got a case.
Go.
Yes, sir.
I know neither of us expected this,
but let's just try and make the best of it.
You ever work a kidnapping case before?
I started my career with the FBI.
That's not what I asked.
I was in profiling.
You're avoiding the question.
Five cases.
And how many of those cases ended successfully?
Three.
I'll drive.
I'll follow you.
Wow. Look at you.
You clean up nice, babe.
You got all dressed up for the new Governor?
Win you any points?
Not exactly.
Danny Williams, this is Officer Lori Weston...
Our new partner.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet... Our new what?
Partner.
Governor Denning assigned me
to your Five-O task force.
To do what?
Uh, assist you in any way I can.
I'm sorry.
I'm pretty sure the word you used earlier was "Babysit."
You're going to babysit us.
Oh, okay, I'm-I... I apol... I...
I apologize. He, uh... he lost his manners
somewhere between the womb and kindergarten.
You will fit right in. It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Come on, GQ. Duke's over here.
Vic's name is Jen Hassley,
15 years old.
Abductor drove off in a red sedan.
Her mother got a partial plate.
We got a MAILE Alert out?
Just hit the wire a few minutes ago.
Run that.
Teenage girls are usually kidnapped for one of two reasons:
Ransom or a sex crime.
Where are the parents?
Over there.
Any strange phone calls?
Anything at all out of the ordinary last couple weeks?
No.
In over half of all kidnapping cases,
the abductor is usually a relative or an acquaintance
of the victim.
Is there anybody you can think of
that would have reason to want to take Jen?
No.
All right. I'm going to send some of our people
to your house-- they're going to set up
phone taps in preparation for a ransom call.
Okay?
Officer Weston is going to accompany you home.
She's going to supervise the whole thing, all right?
Got something.
Oh, my God.
I found this outside the changing tent.
Does it belong to Jen?
Jen was born with a heart condition.
She has to take this medication twice a day.
If she doesn't get this within 24 hours,
she could...
She could die.
That's not going to happen.
Hey.
Good. You're here.
What do you got?
HPD reports all registered sex offenders within five miles
of the abduction site have been accounted for.
They're expanding the search now.
Okay.
Uh, what about Jen's personal life? Anything?
I scanned Jen's cell records and social network profile.
Everything's clean-- no suspicious messages,
no strange calls, nothing to indicate
a potential threat.
All right, see, this is strange.
All right, she's got nothing personal
on her home page, right?
It's all generic publicity stuff.
I mean, kids use these sites to vent,
all right, share secrets, talk trash to each other.
It's like Jen doesn't want anyone
to know who she really is.
Okay, well,
maybe she had a secret profile somewhere.
Keep looking.
Get Jen's laptop, okay?
Mine it and see if you can find anything that she was trying
to keep away from her parents.
Got it.
Hey, just got off the phone with HPD.
MAILE Alert lines are ringing off the hook.
I'm going to have to head back to the station to coordinate a grid search.
Keep us posted, all right?
Yeah.
Hey. So what do we know about the new hire?
She's cute.
She's very cute.
She's attractive.
She used to work for Homeland Security.
That could come in handy.
Yeah, if she lasts.
What? Why wouldn't she last?
We, let's see what she looks like
when she gets done with Sergeant Slaughter's boot camp.
What's that supposed to mean?
Let's just try
and not get the new girl blown up, kidnapped, shot
on her first day, that's all.
Can we do that, Steven?
I can't guarantee that.
Hands on your head.
Turn around slowly.
Do you hear me?
I'm not gonna ask again.
You seem to have a lot of people who really, uh,
cared about you.
That's nice.
Who the hell are you?
You might want to sit down.
Danny was right.
Jen was hiding something.
She has a second social network profile.
I managed to extract
all of the deleted e-mails and private chats
and I found a bunch of exchanges with a guy named Brant Cunningham.
What do we know about him?
Not much.
But everything about it screams predator.
The account is brand-new,
the only e-mails he sent were to Jen, and that profile picture
is a stock shot of a male model
I identified through facial recognition.
All right, when was the last time they exchanged e-mails?
Last week. He asked for her address.
Said he wanted to send her something.
Guys, I'm not seeing anything from a Brant Cunningham here.
And the parents don't remember Jen getting
anything from that name, either.
Okay, it's got to be there.
Well, it's not in her fan mail,
which means she's hiding it.
Wait, this is a girl who's deleting her private e-mails
from this guy, right?
Yeah. Most likely she didn't want her parents to find it.
Huh. Which rules out the sock drawer and under the mattress.
Check for loose floorboards.
No.
The room's carpeted.
This is a good kid.
According to her mom, she's perfect.
She does what she's told, keeps her room clean.
I mean, she's about to go on a 32-mile race
and still remembers to make her bed in the morning.
Clearly, appearances are important to her.
Along with her accomplishments.
I found something.
What do you got?
Guys, the Hassleys aren't Jen's parents.
"This is your birth mother,
and she would like to meet you."
"If you want to know more, meet me behind the changing tent
after your race on Saturday."
Jen has always known she was adopted.
We've been very open with her about it.
Jen's real mother died in childbirth.
It was in the adoption records.
Jen knows that.
I just can't believe
she arranged to meet this person
and didn't say anything about it.
I don't know why she'd lie to us.
Yeah, well, my guess is
Jen's abductor found out she was adopted,
fabricated information about her birth mother
and used that into luring her to meet up him.
Okay, so it had to be someone who knew she was adopted.
Well, she talked about it
in her interview for Aloha Life magazine.
I mean, thousands of people could know.
I'm gonna go take this letter to the crime lab,
see if I can get a print off of it.
All right, hold on, hold on.
Let Kaye take the letter.
Lori, I need you to
stay with the family, okay?
Okay.
And, Lori...
Yeah?
Nice work.
Thanks.
And nice work to you, too. That's good.
What?
"I want you to stay with the family."
I mean, you're keeping this woman at arm's distance.
Is it because she's the governor's hire
or is it something else? Just curious.
Hey, MAILE Alert paid off.
Found our abductor's car.
Kam Highway, southern edge of Wheeler.
All right, let's go.
Nobody.
It's empty. Check the trunk.
I got blood.
And Jen's jacket.
What do you got, Max?
The amount of blood I found on the jacket and in the trunk
is quite troubling.
Approximately six to seven pints.
The odds of anyone surviving after that
much blood loss is quite low.
Okay, but you're saying,
I mean, it's possible she could still be alive, right?
How old is the girl you're looking for?
She's, uh, 15. About 90 pounds. About.
If this is her blood, I find it highly doubtful
that she could have survived.
Listen to me, Max.
I need you to run this, okay?
Because I can't talk to the parents
until I know what we have, you understand?
I'm on it.
Suspect's VIN number:
17q4378019539572.
Got it.
Running it now.
Here we go.
Your car is registered to a Matt Porter.
4810 Loho Street in Kailua.
Matthew Porter! Five-O!
Clear.
All clear here.
No Porter, no Jen.
But you guys should see this.
That's Jen right there.
Who are these other women?
Victims.
Or potential victims.
Take a look at these.
Sam Baker, Todd Kilgore, Charles Tetchy.
He's got, like, 30 of these.
This guy's been at it awhile.
Yep. And he knows how to disappear.
Message two.
Hi, Julie, it's Beth.
Yeah.
I've got a ticket to the show...
That's great. Okay, thank you.
That was the TSA; they have an alert out
on all the names that Porter's been using.
All right, we check plane tickets?
Yes, we did.
There's nothing been purchased under these names.
Okay, good. So Porter might still be on the island.
Right. Unless he got off using an alias we don't know about.
We're running out of time
to get Jen her medication.
Come on!
What do we got? Something, something.
I'm working as fast as I can.
You putting pressure on an already stressful situation
is not gonna make me work any faster.
I can't even verify that Matt Porter
is his real name.
Okay, whoa, whoa.
Look, I don't know what his real name is, either,
but I do know that one of his aliases, Todd Kilgore, is wanted
for questioning in a 2009 kidnapping case in Nebraska.
Okay, good, good, good.
So Jen isn't his first victim.
Or his last.
What do you got?
Julie Nells.
I managed to get into her voice mail and found a message that
Porter left for her yesterday. He asked her to meet him.
Tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m., Wailana Coffee House.
All right.
Hey, you're supposed to be at the Hassleys'.
What's up? You all right?
Yeah, yeah. You got a second?
Yeah, sure.
Good work.
How are the Hassleys doing?
They're a mess.
I mean, they're waiting on a ransom call
that you and I both know isn't coming.
What are you talking about?
Look, I get that you don't want me here.
It's your team, I wasn't your choice.
But sidelining me is just a waste of your resources.
Okay, first of all, I put my resources where I need them.
I needed somebody on the phone.
Come on.
I looked into the Hassleys' financials.
They don't make any money.
Jen hasn't signed any endorsement deals.
Her kidnapping was never about ransom, and you know that.
You just wanted me out of your hair.
Fine.
Fine?
Yeah.
Fine.
I sidelined you.
Well, at least you're man enough to admit it.
Lori, we met this morning.
You expect me to trust you the way I trust these people out here?
I've been in the field with these people,
they've had my back, I trust them with my life.
The Hassleys are trusting me with Jen's life,
and I promised them I'd bring
their daughter home.
Okay, well, there's your first mistake
right there.
Excuse me?
We don't make promises like that around here.
Oh, really? Well, I do.
Those two kidnapping cases that went south--
did you make the same promise to those families?
Yeah. I did. And I don't regret it.
Sometimes you make all the right moves and it just isn't enough.
You know, the Hassleys are no different.
I intend to keep my promise to them.
Hey, wait.
Tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m., Wailana Coffee House.
Meet me there, okay?
Wait a minute.
So you're saying he was in your house?
Yeah.
This is Captain Fryer, the head of Internal Affairs?
What did he want?
He, uh, he asked me a lot of questions
about the asset forfeiture locker
and the money that they said I stole.
I don't understand. You answered all those questions already.
Yeah, well, he wanted to see my face.
See if I was a good liar.
There's something else, isn't there?
IA's ruling on my case tomorrow.
Here, come here.
It's gonna be fine, okay?
They got nothing.
Porter's late.
Yeah. He'll show.
Thank you.
Don't you just hate that?
Hate what?
The top off.
You know, you get just the right mix going--
coffee, cream, sugar-- all working in perfect harmony.
Then, when you're not looking, waitress comes, tops you off.
Ruins a perfectly good cup of coffee.
That's why I switche to tea; they don't mess with that.
What?
I'm just saying.
Told you.
When you're right, you're right.
You know, I expected
somebody who graduated top of his BUD/S class
would take his coffee black, but mm-mm.
Did you pull my file?
Mm-hmm. Last night.
Which is when I assume you pulled mine.
You graduated with honors from Penn State,
but you switched from Bio to Criminal Justice
in your sophomore year.
Mm-hmm.
What happened, you couldn't hack the sciences?
Uh-huh, something like that.
Yeah, Phys Ed was more my style.
Phys Ed?
You care to elaborate on that?
Maybe when I know you better.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, any sign of Porter out there?
No.
How's the date going, buddy?
Chin?
You didn't answer Danny's question.
I will take that as no sign of Porter.
I think she's done waiting.
Let me see if I can stall her.
Hey, you're Julie Nells, right?
I'm Lo... Julie, wait!
She's running, she's running.
Move, move.
Julie!
Whoa, whoa, come here, come here.
Get away from me, I'm not going back!
Julie, it's okay, we're not here to hurt you.
Where's Matt?
What did you do to Matt?
Listen to me, hey, hey, we're Five-O.
Look, okay,
we just want to talk to you.
What do you want from me?
We're just looking for Matt Porter.
Why?
Because we think he might be trying to hurt you, that's all.
Matt?
He wouldn't hurt me.
He saved my life.
Matt Porter rescued me from a cult in Northern California.
What do you mean "rescued"?
That's what he does.
He's an extractor.
Two years ago
I joined this religious movement near Mount Shasta.
When things changed, I tried to leave, but they wouldn't let me
and they've been after me ever since,
so I called Matt.
He was supposed to meet me this morning
to help me disappear for good.
So why did you run from us?
Matt said they might send some people after me.
I'm scared.
I won't go back there.
Okay, okay.
When was the last time you spoke to Matt?
Two days ago.
Okay, how did you contact him?
Matt's got a private number
he only gives out to people he's helping.
Okay, we're going to need that number, okay?
Thanks.
Excuse us.
This doesn't make any sense.
I mean, Jen wasn't in a cult.
She didn't need to be saved.
Why would Porter kidnap her?
I don't know.
I just got
off the phone with Max and he ran tests
on the blood we found in the trunk of Porter's car.
It's not Jen's.
Oh, that's great news.
Okay, so she could be alive.
Well, that's the good news.
The bad news is that the blood
we found in the trunk was a match
to a John Doe gunshot victim HPD found this morning.
Max ran some DNA and got that hit.
That's Matt Porter.
So where's Jen Hassley?
According to Max, Matt Porter was killed
and placed in the trunk of his car somewhere
between 8:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on Saturday
and more than likely
dumped along the Kamehameha Highway shortly thereafter.
Okay, well, Porter's not our guy.
Jen was abducted on a Sunday morning.
Guys, I just got a strange hit on an alias
that Porter was using.
Which one?
James Westerfield... it says here
in Jen's adoption records that he was the one
who delivered Jen to the Hassleys 15 years ago.
Okay, wait a minute.
If Porter was an extractor back then,
maybe Jen's biological parents were actually in a cult.
What if her parents found out where she was
and they just wanted her back?
This could be how they found her.
She's been in the press a lot lately.
Maybe somebody put two and two together.
All right, we need to find out
which cult Porter extracted her from
because that's where Jen is right now.
We're ready for you.
I think I found something that may help narrow down
where Jen was extracted from.
Okay. She was born with a heart valve condition
that required emergency surgery.
Those symptoms would have presented hours after she was born.
Now, a lot of cults don't allow their members to see doctors
or take modern medicine.
So if Jen was born into a cult,
her only chance of survival
would actually be getting extracted.
That's what I'm thinking,
so I...I ran a search on the list of known cults
that prohibit medical treatment.
That is the preliminary list.
I'm cross-referencing it right now with Porter's files
to see if we can narrow it down even further.
That's excellent work, that's great.
Um, anything else?
That's all I got, boss.
Hey, hold up a sec.
Is there, is there anything else you want to,
you want to talk to me about?
What do you mean?
I mean, you seem distracted.
I want you to know that if something is going on,
you can come to me.
I didn't want to bother you in the middle of a case,
but...
I received a phone call yesterday from Langley.
My old boss at the CIA said he picked up on some chatter
he thought I should know about.
What are you talking about?
My fiance might be alive.
How accurate is this intel?
They can't say, but I can't stop thinking about it.
Okay, uh, when are you leaving?
I was hoping as soon as we found Jen.
If there's any chance he might be alive,
Steve, I need to be there.
Yes, you do, and if there's anything that we can do,
you, uh, you come to us, okay?
You're gonna want to hear this.
Matt, it's Rhea.
I know you said it wasn't safe to contact you,
but I need your help.
I think my father knows what happened.
Jen's in danger.
I need you to make sure he doesn't get to her.
So I ran that private number the girl from the diner gave us.
Turns out it has a voice mail account.
This was the only thing on it.
Do we know who Rhea is?
She could be the birth mother.
I'm running the name
and cross-referencing with everyone in Jen's life.
Do we know where the call originated?
Came from an unlisted number on Lanai
a couple of days ago.
Wait, uh, there's a commune on Lanai that's been red-flagged
by several government agencies.
They're the only ones on that island.
That's got to be where Jen is.
About 20 years ago they bought an old plantation
at the end of the Kaena Trail.
Who runs it?
Haole by the name of Steven Carver.
This Steven Carver?
Yep, that's our island's Jim Jones.
Nice.
How many people drinking his punch?
Carver started with about two families.
Now he's got about 50 people on that property,
mostly militia types, isolationists living off the grid,
thinking modern-day society and all its trappings
is the work of the Devil.
This island is not only their home,
it's their Garden of Eden.
They'll do anything to protect it.
I assume they're armed.
I wouldn't bet against it,
but I know someone who's been on the other side of those walls
who might be able to give you a better picture.
Yeah, I've been in there.
It's barely living.
Carver's got them thinking it's paradise.
Do you know if one of his followers is a woman named Rhea?
Yeah, she's Carver's daughter.
Okay, please, if you can, when was the last time you saw her?
Oh, a couple days ago.
She came in to use the phone.
Okay, uh, is this her?
Yeah, it's an old one, but that's Rhea.
Okay, so Carver's been the one exchanging the e-mails with Jen.
He wasn't lying; this is her birth mother.
That makes Carver Jen's grandfather.
Does Carver have weapons up there?
He has rifles, uses 'em to hunt.
Okay, I'm gonna need you to draw me a map of that compound.
Sure, absolutely.
Uh, can I help you?
He one of them?
Yeah.
Danny.
Okay, he made us.
Wait, whoa.
Listen, he's gonna go back to the compound,
tell Carver we're here, Carver's going to run.
What's the fastest way up there?
There's only one road in.
Unless...
Unless what?
This is the only way in-- on an animal?
We couldn't have got an ATV
or a golf cart or something like...?
Did you say ATV?
I did.
They wouldn't hear an ATV from a mile away, would they, Danny?
But you know what? Your whining is probably louder than an ATV.
Whining?
Yeah, you're whining.
How long have you two been married?
That's it, that's it right there.
What are you doing?
I told you to keep away from here.
She's, she's not well.
That's none of your business.
It is my business-- she's my daughter.
And she's my granddaughter and you told me she was dead.
You threw her away like trash.
Go on, go to your room.
I'll deal with you later.
Here. Uh, drink this. There's herbs in here.
It's good for your heart.
I don't want your tea.
I just want to go home. Please.
This is your home.
I know this is hard for you to understand,
but this is my fault.
I-I didn't raise your mother right.
But I'm not gonna make that same mistake with you.
You're my family.
I'm not gonna let them take you away from me.
You're not my family!
Now, listen to me. Listen.
Those people...
are the ones that have been poisoning you.
Now, I can make you better.
You have to trust me.
Just drink your tea.
We've got a problem.
All right.
According to this, Carver's cabin
is right in the middle of the compound, okay?
If Jen is here, that's where he's gonna be holding her.
Wait, I think that's her.
Come on, we got to move.
Down on your knees. Now.
Face down, face down. Hands behind your back.
It's okay. Jen, we're not gonna hurt you.
We're the police. We're Five-O.
Get them inside. Come on.
It's okay.
Where's Jen?
I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?
My father found out you were coming, and he took her.
We got company.
Down! Get down.
Please.
Can we try not to kill everybody in the compound, okay?
One of these hippies might know where Jen is, all right?
Fine.
One, two, three!
What did I just say? Hah!
Go, go, go, go!
Stay down.
Lori. Down!
Drop it.
Where's Jen?
Where did Carver take her?
Don't make me ask you again.
He has a plane.
Where?
Where is the plane?
Two miles west of here.
But you'll never catch him.
Get out of the plane. Show me your hands.
Show me your hands right now!
Get out of the plane.
I just...
Get out of the plane.
On your knees. On your knees.
Leave her alone!
That's my granddaughter.
Jen.
Jen, you hear me?
Everything's gonna be okay, all right?
We're gonna get you back to your parents.
Okay?
I knew as soon as Jen was born
that something was wrong.
She needed medical treatment.
With real doctors.
But my father would never allow it.
He said, "Medicine makes us weak.
We have to empower our bodies to fight."
But her little body-- it just...
It just didn't have anything to fight with.
I-I knew we were losing her.
So that's why you gave her away?
The only way to save her life
was to let her go.
So I faked her death.
But a few weeks ago,
my father was in town and saw a magazine article
about this amazing girl with a heart condition...
...and he just knew it was Jen.
So you called Porter.
I tried to warn him that my father was coming.
And he said he'd take care of it. And...
now he's dead because of me.
No.
You were looking after Jen.
You did what any mother would do to protect their child.
She's not my child.
The Hassleys raised her.
And I'm just thankful for everything they've done.
Rhea, there's someone who'd like to meet you.
Oh, you're leaving?
Kid's got a plane to catch in an hour.
Yeah, so I guess this is good-bye.
For now.
Come on.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, cuz, how'd it go?
Sir, you can't go in there.
We need to talk.
We have nothing to talk about, Lieutenant Kelly.
You're about to kill the career of a good cop
just because you think she did something wrong.
I know... she did something wrong.
Apple doesn't fall far from the family tree.
This isn't about me.
You're right. It isn't.
The governor wants to make it very clear
that there's a zero-tolerance policy
with regard to crime and corruption.
He's tasked me with cleaning up this department,
which is exactly what I am going to do.
Starting with your cousin.
After a lengthy investigation by the Internal Affairs Department,
Officer Kono Kalakaua has been stripped of her badge
and is no longer a member of Five-O
or the Honolulu Police Department.
Her case has been handed over to the prosecuting attorney,
who is officially moving forward with charges.
I'll take your questions now.
