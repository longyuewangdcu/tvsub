One, two, three.
Okay.
Okay. Great.
All right. Don't do that.
Don't do what?
Once you get up, don't look down at your feet.
How am I supposed to know
where my feet are if I can't look down at 'em?
Let's do it again.
Come on.
All right, I feel like a goof.
Okay, I mean, am I gonna actually surf at any point
during this surfing lesson, or no?
Yeah, but you got to master the basics.
I don't care about the basics.
I'm doing this 'cause Grace wants to learn how to surf,
and I figure, it'd be a nice thing for me to do with her.
Okay, and I'm positive that this
is not what she had in mind.
Okay. Okay, okay. You think you're ready?
Of course I'm ready. Come on.
Okay, go catch a wave, brah.
Maybe we can just work on the basics this much more. Okay?
And then we'll go.
What the hell is that?
It's a tsunami warning.
It's a tsunami...? Are you kidding me?
We have to evacuate the area now. Come on.
Hey, get out of here. You move!
Danny, come on. Let's get out of here.
Attention. This is a mandatory evacuation.
Okay, let's go!
Move away from the beach.
This a mandatory evacuation. Move away from the beach.
Governor.
Sir.
Okay.
Where's the point of origin?
What's the ETA of the first wave?
Tsunami warning buoys picked up the wave
about a hundred miles northeast of Wake Island.
They think it was triggered by a deep ocean landslide.
ETA on the first set of waves is, like, three hours.
Yes. Sir, I can be there in ten.
Yes, Governor, I'll be there five.
Competitive much?
It's a curse.
Command's called all personnel back to base.
We're gonna take the fleet out to deep waters and ride it out.
Huh. Must be nice.
I guess the rest of us
who don't have a seat on an aircraft carrier--
We'll just have to get our snorkels out.
Mmm. Be careful today, okay?
Yeah. You, too.
Hey, everything is gonna be okay, monkey.
I promise you that. It's good news.
We get a day off of school, that's all.
Well, my friend Tommy said the waves can get
as tall as buildings and go as fast as race cars.
Oh, he did, huh?
Well, Tommy also told you
that he killed a tiger shark with a boogie board.
Okay, Tommy is what I like to call a pathological liar.
So from now on, we are gonna put the closed sign
on our ears when Tommy talks, okay?
Tommy.
Tommy's a goof, babe.
What's up?
Hey, I need you to meet me
at the Tsunami Warning Center at Ewa Beach, all right?
What? Right now?
Yeah. Now. The head of the Center,
a Dr. Norman Russell, has gone missing.
Hey, you there?
Yeah. It's just, I got Grace,
And, um, Stan and Rachel are out of town.
You got anybody to watch her?
No, I don't. Why? You got anything in mind?
Yeah.
Howzit, bruddah?
You got a high-priority assignment for me.
High-pri... Yeah.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
He looked after my sister.
Yeah, I know, and your sister ran away.
Hey. That's bulai, brah. She tricked me.
Playing on my emotional vulnerabilities.
That part's true.
Shut up, you.
And besides, I'm great with keikis.
I got this.
Baby, you remember Kamekona from Christmas?
Yeah? What do you say?
I mean, word on the street is, he's a lot of fun.
You want to go hang out with him for a little bit?
But I want to stay with you.
That's understandable.
But listen.
You're gonna go play at his house for a little while
Because it's really far away from the water.
Okay? And that's what I want you to do.
The second we get this thing figured out,
which will be very soon-- I can assure you that--
I'm gonna come back, and I'm gonna get you, I promise.
Okay? Is that okay?
Okay.
You like shave ice, Grace? Killahz.
I've been working on some new flavors.
I need a taste-tester.
You down with helping me out?
Yeah.
Awesome...
All right. I love you.
Love you too, Danno.
You got, uh, seat belts?
Danny...
No worry. No worry.
Trust me, bruddah.
Got your back.
You guys know that.
All right, tell me something.
Why is it that we're not helping thousands of people evacuate?
Instead, we're looking for one missing person.
Because, Danny, that one person is responsible
for making sure those thousands of people are safe.
All right, fair enough. Define missing.
Missing as in, hasn't been seen
or heard from since last night.
Chin and Kono are checking his house right now.
Look, Sheldon, there's a big difference between evacuating
at a level one and a level three.
You need to make the call.
I need more time with the data.
Dr. Russell's usually the one who defines the inundation zone.
But Dr. Russell isn't here,
so today, it's your job.
I...
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt.
I'm Lieutenant Commander steve McGarrett from Five-O.
This is Detective Danny Williams.
We're investigating the disappearance of Dr. Russell.
Sheldon Tunney, Deputy Director.
Commander Sam Hale. Coast Guard.
You'll have to excuse me, but we need to move now.
So if you're not going to make the call, I will.
Better to be safe than sorry.
I'm declaring it a level three.
Oh, sorry about that.
Lot of confusion around here without Dr. Russell.
Okay, look, I see a room full of scientists.
What is so important about Dr. Russell? I'm just curious.
Let's talk in my office.
Look, normally, there are a number of us who can interpret
the data we're receiving from the warning buoys.
But the stuff we're getting now is riddled with anomalies.
Anom... what kind of anomalies?
Wave height, water pressure, barometric shift.
They all affect the calculations
as to the size and magnitude of the wave,
and they're all over the map.
Okay, I'm a visual learner.
Okay, uh, here. Look.
This is a simulation based on our most recent data.
In the previous set of data, the wave
was about half the size,
But before that, it was off the charts.
Ever since the buoy triggered
5 a.m., there's been no discernible pattern.
The data keeps changing.
What about the other warning centers?
Are you consulting with them?
We're the main center for the entire Pacific Rim.
We checked with our satellite center in Alaska,
But they're receiving
conflicting data, as well.
Okay, so what you're telling me is, all you people--
you have no idea what's coming at us?
Is that right?
I can make an educated guess
based on the most recent data.
But we're talking about a wave that could be the size
of a three-story building,
and traveling at the speed of a jet plane.
I don't want to guess.
Well, looks like Tommy was telling the truth for once.
Who's Tommy?
He's an eight-year-old boy.
Okay, uh, so what you're saying is,
Dr. Russell could make sense of all of this?
If anyone could, it's him.
He practically developed this technology.
He knows these waters better than anyone.
When's the last time you spoke to him?
Last night at about 5:00,
when we were leaving the office.
And then at 6:00 a.m., I get a page that
the first buoy had indicated a tsunami.
And protocol demands that I consult with Dr. Russell
before initiating any of these emergency procedures,
But he never contacted me, and I couldn't get a hold of him.
Guys, he lives for this stuff.
He'd be the first person
at this office the minute his pager went off.
Chin, what do you got?
Looks like foul play, gentlemen.
Forced entry.
Signs of a struggle.
Well, the neighbors have been evacuated.
But no disturbances have been reported to HPD.
So, Hawaii's top Tsunami expert comes up missing
on, uh... on the one day that we need him?
You know what they say about coincidences.
I don't.
They usually take a lot of planning.
Okay, what do you think?
This happened fast.
They definitely came in from there.
I think he was sitting there, got up.
There was a struggle. He came this way.
He hit the wall.
Sorry, ma'am. Hold it right there.
And he hit the deck.
Blood trail goes that way.
This is my father's house.
Looks like a lot of blood.
Could be a gunshot wound.
Gunshot wound?
What happened?
Where's my dad?
Courtney, when was the last time you spoke to your father?
Last night around 8:00.
Okay. What were you guys talking about?
My physics final.
I had a question about free particles.
And I was totally lost, and he helped me.
What?
I would just really hate it if the last time
I talked to my father was about physics.
Do you remember anything else he said?
Uh, doesn't matter how trivial it seemed.
Uh, we talked about going for a hike this weekend.
That's it.
Um, he seemed totally, you know, fine.
But when the sirens went off this morning,
and I didn't hear from him, I started to get worried.
Who would want to hurt him?
All right, listen. I promise you that we're doing
everything we can to find your father, but right now,
you have to evacuate.
I'm staying here.
I got it. I got it.
Courtney,
your father would want you to be safe. I know that.
All right? I'm going to have an officer take you inland
and the second I hear anything,
you will be the first to know. You have my word, okay?
Okay.
All right?
Thank you.
My friend Mark. He's a very good guy.
He'll take care of you, all right?
Okay, so what do we got?
Skid marks and white paint chips.
Looks like someone pulled out of the driveway fast
and clipped Russell's car-- could be our kidnappers.
There's only 100,000 white cars on the island.
Good shape.
What else?
Empty sandbag.
It could be garbage,
but one man's garbage is another man's evidence.
Let's grab it.
So, I've accessed the TWC security log
to digitally retrace Russell's last steps.
It looks like he logged in this morning at 5:32 a.m.
That's about a half an hour
before the first buoy indicated a tsunami.
Well, maybe he had an early indication of the landslide.
Do we have any idea of what he saw?
No. He didn't log in from this computer, so I can't see
what he was accessing.
Wait a minute. If he didn't log in from this computer,
then maybe he'd been taken already.
Can we trace the IP address from where he did log in?
No. The security log doesn't record IP addresses,
but what it does record are failed login attempts.
Now, when he logged in, he entered
an incorrect password twice
before entering the correct one.
Wait. Don't you mean somebody else was trying
to guess his password?
That's what I thought at first, too.
But the incorrect password that was entered
was the same both times.
Okay. And if somebody was trying to log in,
they would have been trying out different passwords.
Exactly.
The other thing is,
the incorrect password was made of up four numbers:
"1015."
The real password is "CourtneyRose."
It's his daughter's name.
Right. They're nothing alike.
I think he entered the wrong password on purpose.
He was trying to send a message, which means at 5:30,
when he sent that message, he was still alive.
Okay, so at what point are we going to follow the sane people
and just get to high ground?
As soon as we figure out what message Dr. Russell was sending.
Okay, we can't do that, uh, I don't know, up on a mountain?
Somewhere? Ferris wheel? Building?
Something high? Huh?
Mamo, what's up?
Brah, you got to get these cops off my back.
They want me to board up and get off the beach.
Just do as they say, Mamo.
Okay? There's a tsunami coming.
It's not safe to be on the beach.
Steve, I was here in '60,
'64, and '75. I've seen 'em all.
I know the water.
There's no tsunami in her today.
Okay, listen. I hear you,
but you got to get out of there, just in case. All right?
Okay, brah. But I'm telling you.
Somebody's blowing smoke up somebody's 'okole.
Just be safe, Mamo.
That's good. So, Mamo doesn't think that there's a tsunami.
I guess not. But I mean, who knows the water better than him?
Scientists, Steven.
Scientists that study this type of thing, okay,
that told us a tsunami's coming in one hour and 27 minutes.
These watermen have been reading the waves
for hundreds of years, Danny.
I-I commend them for their commitment. I really do.
If Mamo wants to help, why doesn't he use his insights
and tell us where Dr. Russell is.
That would be insightful.
You know what? This whole thing, it doesn't add up.
I mean, why would anyone kidnap dr. Russell?
It's not like he has
any classified government secrets or anything.
Who benefits?
Anybody selling bottled water or gasoline.
That was a joke, Steven.
Wai, wait, wait. No, no, no.
This isn't someone starting a fire to empty a crowded theater.
Okay? This is a natural disaster.
You cannot create a tsunami.
That's right. Unless you can.
Where are you going?
Back to the Tsunami Warning Center.
Did you pick up auntie Emele?
Okay. Good.
All right. Be safe, cuz.
You didn't get called in, did you?
All right. How much more of the hospital do you have to evacuate?
Okay. Just be safe.
Bye.
Was that Malia?
Yeah.
How's auntie Emele?
Fine.
Have you seen Malia since we ran into her at the hospital?
You guys aren't getting back together again, are you?
Easy, cuz. I'm just checking on the hospital's evacuation.
Look, we have to get somewhere
on the failed password and the paint chips.
Everyone's already evacuated. We may have to join them soon.
Okay.
How are the latest projections?
Same as before. All over the map.
We're preparing for the worst.
What's the latest on Dr. Russell?
We think we got a lead, but we need to know
how does the early warning system work?
How do you get your information?
Well, it's really not that complicated.
Hop up. Okay.
Look.
These markers indicate the location
of the tsunami warning buoys.
The buoys record information about the wave
and send that data to the GOES 11 satellite.
And the GOES 11 transmits the data to us.
Got it.
Could you, uh, maybe just simplify?
Uh, 20 words or less.
Like-Like the field trip version?
I don't know what that means.
All right.
Buoys in the water get info.
Send it to the satellite.
The satellite sends it here.
Okay, that's all. Was that so difficult?
No.
Question. Is there a relay station
that the signal passes through
or any place that could compromise the signal?
No. It's a clean feed from GOES 11 to us.
Oh! You'll have to excuse me.
Okay, thank you. You've been very helpful.
Yeah.
How was that helpful?
You just be quiet for a second, okay? So the adults can think.
Think? Think? Thinking? Is that what that face means?
Hey, it's me.
What do you need?
Why can't I just be calling to say hello?
Theoretically, it's possible. Sure. But you never have before,
and it seems like a really odd time to start.
That is a fair point.
Uh, I need to know if there's a second signal
being transmitted on the same frequency
as the GOES 11 satellite.
Sure.
What's going on?
I don't know yet.
What?
What are you talking about-- a second signal?
Th-This. I understand that.
There's a buoy and it goes to a satellite
and the satellite goes here. I understand that.
But, Mr. Wizard,
I'm curious. Why do we care?
Tunney was saying the data kept changing this morning.
Okay? What if it's changing
because a false signal is overriding
the actual signal from space?
This... space.
So the buoys and the satellite thing is...
They're not...?
Dr. Russell, Danny! Dr. Russell!
Why are you yelling at me?
Just...
Steve?
Hey.
Okay. You were right. There is a second signal,
and it's not coming from space.
It's coming from a boat in the Ala Wai Harbor.
Okay, I need to know if anybody is on the boat.
Okay, can you get me thermals?
Are you trying to get me court-martialed?
Come on. I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.
Although, having you on land more often
would have its benefits.
Okay, thermals are up.
You got at least one live body on board.
Can you text me the coordinates?
I can do you one better.
It's the Avery Claire, slip 21.
You're the best. Thank you.
Steve, please tell me
that you're not even thinking of going out there, okay?
This is right in the path of the wave.
It's okay. I got an hour. There's plenty of time.
I'll call you later, okay?
Your theory.
Dr. Russell was kidnapped
to create a fake signal.
What? No gold star?
Let's go get the boat, okay?
Wait. What if you're wrong?
This is good. This is genius.
Now we're driving towards the water. This is your plan?
This is your plan?
Listen to me. If I'm gonna die on this island,
which I never should have come to in the first place,
your face is not the last face I want to see.
You understand that? Respectfully, of course.
Mcgarrett, 5-0.
Ok.
I know you like it here.
I like... here? I like...
Incorrect. You are incorrect, my friend.
Then why the board, huh?
I mean, did hell freeze over?
Did I actually miss out on seeing you trying
to get up on that thing?
No comment.
All right? Let's stick to a more pressing theory,
as to why you think Dr. Russell is in this boat.
Because this is where
the second signal is coming from.
The second signal?
Yeah.
Oh. Okay. Well, I hope you're right.
Because if you are not,
we are going to be sleeping
with the fishes, literally, in 45 minutes.
Chin, go ahead.
We've got a problem.
What is that?
The wave just picked up speed-- it's coming in faster
than they thought.
How much faster?
It's coming right now.
All right. Come on, Steve. What are we doing? Let's go.
Come on.
It's not coming.
It's not coming.
The water's not receding.
If the wave was coming, the water would be receding.
Nobody else... nobody else finds that significant enough
to call this thing off.
Danny, there's nobody else here. There's no one around.
Nobody else knows about the second signal.
This is just a wild guess: that's not Dr. Russell.
Yeah. I don't think so.
Okay. My work is done.
Can we go now, please?
Come on.
Where's Dr. Russell?
Look, could we... Could we do this on land?
Potentially maybe in one of these tall buildings? Tenth floor?
Please.
The tsunami's not real.
Is it?
Maybe it's late.
What if it's late?
The Warning Center's been picking up her signal,
not the actual feed from the satellite.
She's been transmitting false data since this thing started.
Naughty, naughty, naughty hacker.
If that is true, understand,
you are in a lot of trouble-- so who are you
and who are you working for?
Hey. We're still dry.
Yeah, sorry,
it was a false alarm.
Right after you hung up,
the buoy's warning sensors updated and pushed
the wave's arrival time back to 11:00 a.m.
That's still not a lot of time
for you guys to get out of there, though.
It's okay, I don't believe the tsunami's real.
Russell wasn't on the boat, but we found the source
of the fake signal-- it's a hoax.
A hoax? That's a hell of a practical joke.
How can you be sure?
We can't be, which is why right now
we stick to the primary plan.
Hey, do you remember what I told you about coincidences?
They take a lot of planning.
The false alarm hit at 10:15.
10:15, as in 1-0-1-5?
That's Dr. Russell's failed password.
He knew-- and he was trying to tip us off
by manipulating the data.
That's what I think, too.
But what I don't get is, why take Russell
and then have him fake a tsunami?
To create a distraction.
Any potential witnesses have cleared out.
The police are busy with the evacuation.
It's the perfect time to pull off something big.
You guys see if you can figure out what they're after.
We're gonna work on trying to find Dr. Russell.
Got it.
This is what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna ask you, uh, one more time,
and then I am gonna potentially get angry.
So, please tell me-- where is Dr. Russell?
Look, you're just transmitting information, okay?
Dr. Russell is sending
it to you from someplace else, isn't he?
Against his will.
Mebody's forcing him to do this.
This is the part where you answer his question.
Okay.
You see?
You put us both in a bad position now-- he's gonna go do something stupid.
Any luck with the paint you found outside Russell's place?
Yeah, turns out it's unique.
Only issued to government vehicles.
Government?
I'm thinking maybe
our abductors stole one so they could hide in plain sight.
Town's crawling with them.
I just haven't heard back from HPD.
Yeah, well, I think they're a little bit busy right now.
What are all these?
Well, all government-issued vehicles,
they're equipped with GPS.
So these are the live locations of all the evac trucks
sent out by department of Emergency Management,
the Coast Guard, the National Guard.
Any one of them could have been at Russell's.
Hard to get eyes on them all.
Yeah.
How many of these are in or around the evac zone?
Twenty-four.
All of them with the same white paint we're looking for.
McGarrett thinks all this
is a distraction from some bigger crime,
so what we should do
is narrow down a list of high-value targets
within the evacuation zone-- consulates,
locations of visiting dignitaries, ambassadors...
The bigger the distraction, the bigger the target.
Yeah.
All right.
Get some answers here.
Cute kid.
Look at you.
You're all cleaned up, nice, combed, fancy.
A little... side part going on.
Obviously, a long time ago.
That, uh,
that's your little girl-- you don't see her that often, do you?
I think kids are the best.
Best thing ever.
The thing is about them at that age
is that they have the worst memories.
You know, my daughter, when she was three years old,
She hadn't seen her uncle in, I don't know,
five, six months, and then he
comes around, goes to pick her up,
and she goes bananas.
I mean, she loses her mind,
like she's never seen the guy in her life.
All right, starts screaming bloody murder.
I take her back.
Anyway, they grow up fast, is what I'm saying.
You know what else? When you get locked up
for kidnapping Dr. Russell, I mean,
it could be five... it could be ten years.
Before you see her again.
No, you can't do that!
Okay.
Speaks.
Look, I don't know any Dr. Russell, okay?
Okay. So tell us what you do know.
Every eight minutes i get an e-mail
with new data from somewhere.
And they're giving me 25K to transmit it
over the tsunami warning frequency.
Who is? Who's paying you?
I don't know. It's all anonymous.
They found me online.
They sent me the money, in cash, and a pager.
The pager went off this morning,
So I started broadcasting.
How long is this supposed to go on for?
I don't know, until noon?
And then what?
It's over, I guess.
All right, I need to know who's sending these e-mails.
How am I supposed to know that?
You're a hacker. Hack.
Come on.
Howzit?
Yo, Fridge, what's good?
How's my baby girl?
Oh, she's easy kine, brah.
Right now my family's teaching her about King Kamehameha
and the unification of the Hawaiian Islands.
Okay. What... Hold on, what is that sound?
Please do me a favor-- don't do the part
where the king throws his enemies off the cliff.
Ah, that's the best part.
Could I just speak to her, please?
Keiki, Danno for you.
Hello?
Hey, baby. How you doing?
Can I go home now?
No, you got to hang in there a little bit longer for me, okay?
I'm gonna be there just as soon as I can.
Okay.
I love you, monkey.
Love you, too.
Is there anything else you want to do, Grace?
Mmm... me and Daddy like to play cards.
Shootz, you're looking at the king of Go Fish.
How about five-card draw?
Hey, everything okay?
Is it okay? Yeah, it's perfect.
Daughter's spending the day with an ex-criminal informant.
Everything is just peachy.
I blame you.
Excuse me. I blame you.
How are we going on a location?
I have a floating I.P. buried under layers
of firewalls and encryption.
Rome didn't burn in a day.
I-I don't... I'm pretty sure that's not...
All right, is that him?
No, it's an e-mail from your friend.
It's been eight minutes-- I have to refresh the data.
Oh, no, don't bother-- just trace the e-mail
and find out where it's coming from.
No, wait, we need her to keep
transmitting until noon like she agreed.
Otherwise, the kidnappers are gonna know
that their cover is blown
and Dr. Russell is as good as dead.
Okay, so we'll just keep thousands of people in the dark
and maintain panic in the streets.
I like it.
The governor
is not gonna cancel the alert until we know for sure
from Dr. Russell that there is no real threat.
Hah. Gotcha.
There's our man.
Chin, what do you got?
The address checks out.
It's an old storage warehouse down on the docks.
Okay, we're on the way.
Hey, you got any hits on the paint
we collected at the crime scene?
I ran a list of potential high-value targets within the evac zone,
and I crossed them against GPS locations
of the government vehicles within the area,
and only six of the targets
have government vehicles within a couple blocks.
Okay, they only wanted Tanya to keep up
the signal until noon, which means
whatever's going down is going down right now.
We don't have time to cover all the targets and find Russell.
Fine. Guys, grab the op gear, meet us at the docks.
All right...
This is the place; they came in here.
It's bolted from the inside.
How do you want to get in?
Right over there. There's no sight lines.
Just a few more hours,
and you'll get to see your daughter.
I've got eyes on Dr. Russell.
It's time for your next transmission.
Get to work.
Stay put.
Five-O! Drop your weapon!
You couldn't have walked him down the steps?
What's in his hand, Danny?
He drew his gun on me, okay?
You know, this guy looks familiar.
Well, if he's in the system, we'll get a name.
Got it.
They said I needed to keep sending new data until noon.
If I didn't give them new numbers every eight minutes,
they were gonna kill my daughter.
She's okay. We had an
officer take her someplace safe.
Thank you.
All right, you said "They."
I heard him on the phone.
They needed a sector of the city evacuated.
Which sector? Did you hear?
No. But they needed me to fabricate data
that would force an evacuation deep inland.
Do you have any idea what they were after?
No.
Hey.
Hey, I got a hit on the print.
All right, hey.
Name is Harrison Dunphy.
Dishonorably discharged from the Coast Guard
eight years ago due to conduct unbecoming.
Coast Guard?
Yeah.
Kono, bring every Coast Guard vehicle with white paint
and get a live location, okay?
We need to see if these guys are
in front of any of the potential targets.
Right, you got it.
This guy, Dunphy,
He ever serve with the 14th District?
Yeah. How'd you know that?
'Cause eight years ago,
HPD worked a joint narco case with the Guard.
We raided a shipment coming in off a freighter.
Impounded 700 kilos of cocaine,
along with millions of dollars in cash.
$28 million?
$28 million that ended up
in the HPD asset-forfeiture locker.
Which is right in the center of the evacuation zone.
Kono.
I'm already on it.
Pulling up the forfeiture locker.
There's a white truck parked out in front right now.
That's it-- they're going for
what they think is $28 million.
What they think is $28 million.
Not until you borrowed $10 million of it to save my life.
We didn't have a choice.
Look, if we didn't meet Hesse's demanding $10 million,
he would've killed you.
Well, $28 million, $18 million,
doesn't matter-- they're hitting
the locker right now.
She's right.
Hold on for one second. Let's just think.
Think about what this means.
Hey, I know what this means, Danny.
We go bust these guys,
HPD does an inventory on that money,
they are gonna see that $10 million is missing.
It doesn't necessarily trace back to us.
We asked the governor to borrow $10 million,
and she turned us down.
As soon as the HPD tell her exactly how much is missing,
she's gonna put it all together.
Well, what's the alternative?
We could let 'em go.
Get a clean slate...
All right, and then I'd never
look at my daughter in the face again. Let's go.
I'll drive.
We're doing the right thing.
I know.
We knew about the risks when we took the money.
I know.
We should call HPD, get backup.
That's an excellent idea-- just invite more cops
to arrest us.
You know what? I know what you're thinking, all right?
This is all my fault, and that's fine.
Listen to me, I was there, too, my eyes were wide open,
and I would do it again.
It was worth it for Chin.
But you have to admit we've been crossing the line
a little too easily lately.
All right? And now it looks like we are going to pay for it.
HPD Command.
Yeah, this is Five-O.
We need assistance at the main station.
Five-O, be advised, closest responding unit is ten away.
What are you talking about, ten away?
You guys should be right there!
All units are tied up on evac line
at Lunalilo Street.
Who ordered them that far back?
Orders came down from the Warning Center from Commander Hale.
Hale? From the Coast Guard?
Affirmative.
Thank you, dispatch.
It was him.
He knew the warning system, the evacuation protocol,
and he had access to Russell.
What do you think the odds are that he was with the 14th when
that bust went down?
Okay, he was playing us this morning,
Captain America out to protect the coastlines.
I don't like being played.
We need to call the Coast Guard, tell them
they're gonna take down one of their own today.
That's him right there.
Hey, hands, hands, hands!
What the hell are you doing?
We're supposed to be getting out of the evac zone.
Shut up!
Got a scratch, right on the money.
All right, hands on the truck right now!
Hands on the truck right now!
Your buddy Dunphy tell you about his hit-and-run this morning?
What's going on here? We have to clear this area right now.
That's I've been telling them.
Game's over, Hale.
We know there's no tsunami,
and we know what you're after.
This guy walks out the front door of HPD
with millions of dollars in confiscated drug money.
That's ridiculous! I have no idea what you're talking about!
Then you won't mind us taking a look
in the back of your truck.
You're making a big mistake, Commander McGarrett.
Are we done here now?
Because if it's okay with you,
I'd like to get back to my job evacuating the city.
After which I look forward to having a nice, long chat
with the governor about this incident.
Recognize this?
We found one just like it outside of Dr. Russell's house.
It's a sandbag. There are thousands everywhere.
Yes, there are.
That's smart.
Wait till the disaster's been averted,
everybody's relieved, the cleanup's underway,
and then you come back and you collect.
Coast Guard tracked that drug deal for six months.
It was supposed to be our takedown,
but then HPD swooped in,
took the credit.
Now I'm being pushed out before my 20,
no pension, no benefits.
My country owes me.
Hey, let's clear one thing up right now.
You swore to support and defend this country,
no matter what the cost.
She doesn't owe you anything, okay?
This, uh...
could be our last chance to say it. Go on.
Book him, Danno.
How much money is this?
It's $28 million.
It was.
Lost again!
Hey, babe.
Daddy!
What are you doing, taking everybody's dough?
Yeah? Good girl.
Thank you, brother.
What are you looking at? We're all in this together.
Lieutenant Commander, she's ready for you.
The governor only wants McGarrett.
Listen, whatever happens, none of us
would've done anything any different, all right?
Yeah.
She wanted to thank us.
Actually, she wanted to, uh,
to congratulate us on another job well done.
I'm-I'm sorry, what?
All right, what about the money?
$28 million.
It's all present and accounted for.
Wh-Whoa. I don't understand.
