i get ava hessington acquitted ...
darby backs me for managing partner .
i don &apos;t want it anymore .
get out of my sight .
you called mariga .
to offer him a bribe .
doesn &apos;t matter .
dennis never had him in the first place .
but he does now .
you &apos;re saying he traced my call ?
you &apos;re suing me for ownership of mikado .
he said he might as well have left his cat
with michael vick .
i &apos;m offering you a settlement .
you get back the associates .
i get back my cat .
clifford danner . he was 18 .
i put him in jail 12 years ago .
he &apos;s innocent .
cameron buried the evidence .
emmanuel mariga 20 years ago
at the university of cape town .
he was on the rugby team .
you know who else played rugby ?
stephen huntley .
stephen was the one who ordered those killings .
i &apos;m so sorry , harvey .
tell me he looks worse .
he does .
are you hurt ?
no , i &apos;m fine .
i hope you didn &apos;t do that because of me .
it was a fight , donna , not a duel .
how could i not have--
listen to me .
stephen betrayed us all .
you don &apos;t understand , harvey .
i was with him .
and he was capable of something like that ,
and i didn &apos;t even see it .
you know , i &apos;m supposed to--
donna !
it &apos;s okay .
just tell me you &apos;re gonna make him pay .
he &apos;ll pay .
let &apos;s not talk about it .
talk about what ?
what do you need me to do ?
i need you to keep going with everything you have
to impeach mariga &apos;s testimony .
what about the stuff on stephen ?
not yet .
why not ?
because we don &apos;t have proof .
the trial &apos;s in two days .
we should bring ava in and tell her--
not yet .
why not ?
because we don &apos;t have proof .
harvey , we have to do something .
and how would that conversation go ?
&quot; hi , ava , turns out one of the lawyers from our firm
is trying to frame you for a crime he committed . &quot;
&quot; but right now we &apos;re not sure we can do anything about it . &quot;
what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna go home , get a good night &apos;s sleep ,
and then tomorrow i &apos;m gonna find out
what the whole story is .
harvey , stephen isn &apos;t gonna tell you
what the whole story is .
no , but there &apos;s someone else who can .
you knew this case was heading your way
before you ever came after us .
that &apos;s why you wanted to merge .
yes , it is .
and i regret the situation as much as you do .
but what &apos;s done is done .
is that what you told stephen when you found out he did it ?
found out ?
how do we know he didn &apos;t order it ?
because i am giving you my word .
why should we trust a man who sent stephen over here
to cover his ass ?
i sent stephen over here because i care about ava ,
which is why i sent him to the e.i.r. in the first place .
i had no idea he would do what he did ,
and i have been trying to fix it ever since .
then fix it right now .
and how exactly can i do that ?
by stating in court
stephen acted alone without ava &apos;s knowledge .
i can &apos;t .
why not ?
because he never told me .
and you never asked because you never wanted to know .
you piece of shit .
you care about ava so much .
how could you do this to her ?
i wasn &apos;t doing anything to her .
i was trying to do something for her .
remind me never to ask you for any favors .
well , i &apos;m not asking for a favor .
but you are going to agree to do something right now .
and what is that ?
it &apos;s not gonna work .
i cut you off to get your attention .
well , you have it .
good , &apos; cause i just have one question for you .
how can you live with yourself ?
what ?
you know what ?
i don &apos;t have any questions for you .
i just came in here to let you know that you make me sick .
obviously i hurt you , donna ,
and i never meant to do that .
oh , you didn &apos;t hurt me .
you just made me somebody who slept with a murderer .
murderer ?
i don &apos;t know what you think you know ,
but those people that were killed were terrorists .
they were people ...
who lived on top of something that you wanted .
people who had guns-- murderers , donna .
now , if you &apos;re so appalled by how business is done ,
may i suggest that you return
all of your designer clothes that you look so ravishing in ,
because they &apos;re paid for
by the dirty work this firm does .
we don &apos;t kill people .
you mean chemical companies that harvey represents
or car companies that harvey defends ?
how about insurance providers whose claims he helps deny ?
don &apos;t bring him into this .
he &apos;s always been in this .
you know what ? i &apos;ve had enough of this .
i didn &apos;t really cut off your shit to get your attention .
i cut it off because you don &apos;t need it anymore .
you &apos;re fired .
darby would never allow that .
edward darby signed your pink slip an hour ago .
2 months 5 days and 13 hours under nigel &apos;s tutelage
this is what you have to show for it ?
that &apos;s over 20 motions .
20 dog shits .
did you get this out of a grisham novel ?
because that &apos;s fiction .
and you ...
my mother can get this motion thrown out .
and you--well , you &apos;re gone anyway in two days .
listen up , people .
i &apos;ve reviewed your work in my absence .
and guess what .
it &apos;s pathetic .
every stinking one of you should get down on your knees
and thank god and me
for letting you continue to exist in our kingdoms .
louis , what was that about ? what &apos;s going on ?
it was about me letting these assholes know who &apos;s in charge .
they know you &apos;re in charge .
they put you in charge .
they didn &apos;t put me in shit .
they sat there in judgment while my character got ripped apart ,
and not one of them lifted a single finger to help .
they ruled in your favor . they chose you over nigel .
no , they made me give up mikado for them .
okay , you &apos;re displacing your anger over mikado onto them .
they didn &apos;t put you in this position .
it &apos;s not fair .
you &apos;re right .
they didn &apos;t put me in this position ,
but i know who did .
goddamn darby .
unleashes his dog , leaves us to clean up the mess .
we can still go after mariga in court .
i mean , he &apos;s an admitted murderer
who cut a deal to save his life .
wait a second .
that deal is only good if he &apos;s telling the truth .
we can &apos;t go after him with the truth on the stand .
maybe , but we can go after him with the truth not on the stand .
cameron would have to be willing to listen .
then i better get him to listen .
and i better go after mariga .
and change your clothes .
what ? why ?
if they see a lawyer within 20 yards of that lobby ,
they &apos;ll lock the place down .
oh , you &apos;re not room service .
no , i &apos;m not , but ...
i do need to talk to colonel mariga .
and i need to stop paying alimony to my cheating ex @-@ wife ,
but that &apos;s not going to happen .
if you let me in , maybe i can make that happen .
and how the hell are you gonna make that happen ?
i &apos;m a lawyer .
you don &apos;t look like a lawyer to me .
okay . all right . you got me .
look , i &apos;m not-- i &apos;m not a lawyer .
in fact , between you and me , i &apos;m a complete fraud .
but what i am is colonel mariga &apos;s cousin .
on his mother &apos;s side .
all right .
okay , all right !
all right , you don &apos;t believe me ?
that &apos;s fine . just do me a favor , okay ?
give him this photo of him and my uncle stephen .
then let him decide if he wants to talk to me .
louis , how did you get in here ?
i told them i was your uncle .
though how they could believe that we share
the same dna is beyond me .
this is about your trial , isn &apos;t it ?
you &apos;re goddamn right it is !
why the hell would you do that to me ?
i had no choice . i was subpoenaed .
it was a mock trial . you could have refused .
what do you want from me , louis ?
i want to yell at you !
well , you can &apos;t do that anymore-- you fired me .
is that what this whole thing was all about ?
you &apos;re damn right it was . and you want to know the truth ?
when i found out about your stupid trial ,
i called nigel and volunteered .
how dare you ?
me firing you was business .
you bringing up the death of my cat ,
that was personal .
you made me take care of that stupid cat .
i &apos;m allergic . it could have killed me .
and when that cat did die ,
not only did you never tell me that it wasn &apos;t my fault ,
you then fired me in front of my very best friend .
if that &apos;s not personal , then i don &apos;t know what is .
now get the hell out of my office .
i will .
but before i do ,
i have some personal news for you
about how your firing really went down .
ah , i love this . we &apos;d just won the championship .
might i get a copy ?
yeah , i &apos;ll get one framed for you .
you can look at it in the ten minutes
before they put you to death .
the photograph proves nothing .
trust me , there &apos;s a whole lot more where that came from .
we know all about the ties between you and stephen .
then bring them up .
but i made a deal to testify against ava ,
and that is what i &apos;m going to do .
no , you made a deal to put away
the person responsible for ordering these killings ,
and i suggest you do that while you still can .
young man ...
if your intention is to shake my testimony ,
that is not going to happen .
it doesn &apos;t need to happen ,
&apos;cause once we prove that you &apos;re lying about ava ,
cameron dennis is going to cancel your deal ,
and you &apos;re gonna come to me begging for help .
do you think you &apos;re the scariest man
i &apos;ve ever sat across from ?
i know you &apos;re not scared of me .
but you are scared of your own people ,
and you should be ,
because you and i both know
they &apos;re gonna kill you the minute you get back .
that i know stephen doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m lying about ava .
but you are .
ah , and you can see into my soul .
it doesn &apos;t take a fortune teller to know you &apos;re lying .
and it doesn &apos;t take one to know that if you had proof ,
you wouldn &apos;t be here talking to me .
so you &apos;re not protecting stephen out of principle .
i &apos;m not a man of principle .
i &apos;m a man of expediency .
i get it .
if you change your tune now , you &apos;ll lose the deal you have .
therefore , i prefer to-- how do you say it--
dance with the one who brought me .
harvey , what are you doing here ?
game time &apos;s tomorrow . we got nothing to say .
i &apos;m here to help you .
i don &apos;t need your help .
and you wouldn &apos;t be here unless you need mine .
you &apos;re wrong .
i can help you do what you always said you &apos;re all about--
putting bad guys away .
you got a confession for me ?
you &apos;re going after the wrong person .
you &apos;re her lawyer . that &apos;s what you would say .
i &apos;m not here as her lawyer .
this isn &apos;t a speech for a jury .
i &apos;m here man @-@ to @-@ man to talk to the guy i used to know .
all right .
talk .
i know who really did this .
then tell me who it is .
i need a guarantee
you won &apos;t use what i tell you against ava .
if you think i &apos;m gonna guarantee you
anything but a war tomorrow ,
you are sadly mistaken .
i can &apos;t tell you who did it ,
but somebody else can .
who ?
colonel mariga .
are you kidding me ?
i &apos;ve got the murder weapon .
he says ava hessington pulled his trigger ,
and you want me to have him change his story ?
he &apos;s only pointing at ava
because that &apos;s what you want to hear .
change his deal ,
he &apos;ll tell you the truth .
he changes his story now ,
anything he says
about anybody means shit .
it means shit in court ,
but if you are who you say you are ,
it should mean something to you .
you know what , harvey ?
i believe that you believe she &apos;s innocent ,
and if you can convince me of that ,
i won &apos;t go after her ,
but i &apos;m not gonna guarantee
i won &apos;t use what you say before i hear it .
you want me to just trust you ?
that &apos;s what you &apos;re asking me .
but if you think
that i &apos;m gonna kneecap my star witness the day before the trial ,
you are out of your mind .
harold , what &apos;s up , man ?
it &apos;s good to see you .
i thought you were my friend .
i am . what the hell ?
friends don &apos;t say they tried to save your job
when , really , they hung you out to dry .
so it &apos;s true .
look , harold , i didn &apos;t mean to--
you know what ? save whatever bullshit explanation you have ,
because i don &apos;t want to hear it .
i &apos;m not trying to give you a bullshit explanation .
because there is none .
you got to choose between you and me ,
and you chose yourself .
and then you lied to me about it .
yes , yes , harold , i did .
and then after i lied to you ,
i got you a job at a huge , powerful firm .
yeah , you got me that job
so i &apos;d owe you one when the time came .
i got you that job
because i thought you deserved a second chance .
and then you came calling
when you needed a lawsuit filed
to get rid of your witnesses in your murder trial .
i trusted you with that lawsuit
because i thought you were a competent attorney .
and you were more than happy to take it .
and that murder trial you just mentioned is about to start .
so you can choose to be pissed off with me or move on .
but right now i have a job to do .
rachel .
louis , what did you do ?
what do you mean ? what is this ?
fairfield computers is being sued .
how &apos;s that my fault ?
because they &apos;re your client ,
and the attorney of record is harold gunderson .
he also sent a settlement offer .
he wants to pick a fight with me .
he &apos;s gonna regret the day he was born .
aren &apos;t you the one who picked a fight with him ?
rachel , whose side are you on ?
don &apos;t answer that question .
you shouldn &apos;t be here .
stephen said that we &apos;re no different than he is .
i need to see you show him that he &apos;s wrong .
this isn &apos;t his trial . it &apos;s ava &apos;s .
you &apos;re not gonna put him on the stand ?
you said you were gonna make him pay .
donna , i will , but now is not the time .
then when ?
because he killed people ,
and if we let him get away with it ...
then maybe we are no different than he is .
had these insurgents had their way ,
they would have blown up the pipeline .
instead , ms. hessington retained a valuable asset ,
and i , in turn , was compensated for a job well done .
and this compensation came directly from ava hessington ?
yes .
she specifically directed you to kill people ?
yes .
one more thing , colonel mariga--
do you and i have a deal
for you to testify in exchange for a more lenient sentence ?
yes .
and why should the jury believe
that you aren &apos;t making this up to save yourself ?
because if what i say to you proves to be a lie ,
you &apos;ll send me back home ,
where i will be dead within minutes .
no further questions .
ten minutes recess .
why didn &apos;t you just jump right in there ?
i get it-- you read a book
that says you don &apos;t let the jury sit with things .
the only problem is ...
we &apos;re not inside of a book .
and i don &apos;t want to seem defensive .
harvey , we still have a ton of shit to hit him with .
were you in there ?
they &apos;re buying what he saying .
then we make them buy something else .
we got a pair of aces .
if the jury believes that cameron &apos;s got three of a kind ,
we &apos;re not gonna win .
we can &apos;t go after stephen .
cameron won &apos;t go after ava
if i can convince him it was stephen .
you went to cameron ?
yes .
and you &apos;re going to trust him ?
i &apos;m not sure we have another choice .
if you &apos;re thinking what i think you &apos;re thinking ,
don &apos;t .
i &apos;m thinking i &apos;d like to rip your face off .
you get mariga to point the finger at me ,
i will point it straight at ava .
stephen , jessica doesn &apos;t respond well to threats .
well , i don &apos;t make threats .
i give warnings .
you &apos;ve been warned .
mr. specter ...
i have no questions for colonel mariga , your honor ,
but i &apos;d like to call a rebuttal witness .
harvey , come on , you know what he &apos;s gonna say .
i don &apos;t care what he &apos;s gonna say .
he &apos;s talking to the jury . i &apos;m talking to cameron dennis .
the defense calls stephen huntley to the stand .
what has stephen huntley got to do with this ?
harvey knows what he &apos;s doing .
this is what you wanted to sell me--
a lawyer from your own goddamn firm ?
you want to put away the bad guy ?
i &apos;m about to hand him to you on a silver platter .
mr. huntley ,
did you work at the law firm headed by edward darby last year ?
yes .
did mr. darby ask you to solve any problems for hessington oil
regarding their pipeline in the e.i.r. ?
i decline to answer under my fifth amendment rights .
the right against self @-@ incrimination .
how long have you known colonel mariga ?
i decline to answer .
is it true that you went to school with him
at the university of cape town ?
i decline to answer .
well , let me refresh your memory .
you were teammates on a championship rugby team .
objection . counsel is testifying .
the witness is hostile , your honor .
hostile ? they work at the same law firm .
he was fired yesterday .
gentlemen , approach .
he &apos;s making things up to create reasonable doubt .
i &apos;m bringing things up , so you &apos;ll see the truth .
the only thing tying ava to this is mariga &apos;s testimony .
you only have mariga because you tapped stephen &apos;s phone .
that &apos;s a ridiculous accusation .
cameron , please .
why did he call him ? how did he call him ?
enough .
you &apos;re on a short leash , mr. specter .
the gentleman invoked his rights .
mr. huntley , did you meet with your old friend
emmanuel mariga and direct him
to kill the opponent of hessington oil &apos;s pipeline
without ava hessington &apos;s knowledge ?
i decline to answer .
i have no further questions .
mr. dennis , do you have any questions ?
mr. dennis .
mr. huntley , until you were let go ,
you worked at the same firm as mr. specter , correct ?
yes .
and his job today is to give this jury
cause to doubt that his client is the murderer ?
yes .
in your experience ...
is pointing the finger at someone else
a good strategy ?
it can be an excellent strategy .
and why do you think that mr. specter
is pointing the finger at you ?
well , maybe it has something to do with the fact
that a few weeks ago ms. hessington approached me
and asked me to bribe witnesses
who were about to testify against her ,
and i refused .
and if you think i &apos;m lying under oath ,
then , please , ask mr. specter .
he knows that &apos;s the truth .
and a woman who bribes witnesses against her
is not innocent .
objection .
withdrawn . one last thing .
did the defendant ask you to arrange a meeting
with colonel mariga where she she would pay him
millions of dollars in exchange for ...
killing opponents of her pipeline ?
i decline to answer .
can &apos;t blame a guy for trying .
no further questions .
is stephen huntley involved in all this
some kind of stunt like he just told the jury it was ?
he ordered the killings .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
we didn &apos;t have proof .
why would you put that man on the stand ?
it was a calculated risk .
you took a calculated risk with my life without telling me .
i &apos;m sorry .
you screwed me .
i said i wouldn &apos;t go after her
if you convinced me . you didn &apos;t convince me .
then take a recess instead of twisting everything he said .
i &apos;m not gonna let the jury sit with that shit .
and thank god i didn &apos;t .
otherwise , i would have found out
that she tried to bribe witnesses
and you kept it from me .
it had nothing to do with the murders .
that &apos;s funny-- when i kept things from you
that had nothing to do with other murders ,
you called me a criminal .
well , that ended up with you
putting an innocent person in prison .
and now you &apos;re doing it again .
oh , don &apos;t give me that shit .
stephen huntley is up to his goddamn neck in this ,
and you know it .
so he just goes around killing his clients &apos; enemies
behind their backs ?
i don &apos;t think so .
you want corroboration ? ask mariga .
i just did .
and he answered me in open court .
and i &apos;m not putting an innocent woman away .
i &apos;m doing my job .
cameron ...
lawyers killing people ?
that &apos;s a hell of a firm you got your name on , harvey .
you must be proud to have left the d.a. &apos; s office for that .
let &apos;s do racquetball , james .
again ? louis , you were supposed to be waiting
in the conference ...
i don &apos;t wait for anyone .
and you don &apos;t sue me .
yes , i do .
because i realized i now work at a huge firm ,
and i have the power to do this to you .
now , we can negotiate a settlement ,
unless , of course , you don &apos;t think you can handle me .
do you really want to embarrass yourself
with your mother watching ?
it kills you that they don &apos;t ban us having pictures
of our mothers , like you did , doesn &apos;t it ?
a man is judged by the photos he displays .
you have a photo of yourself .
and now you &apos;re making my point for me .
you don &apos;t intimidate me anymore , louis .
really ? i know you , harold .
i know that you gargle before meetings that make you nervous .
and i ... smell ... mint .
i ...
we don &apos;t agree to paragraph three
or four .
i need to have four .
or seven through ten .
my mo--my client won &apos;t stand for that .
your client will stand for whatever the hell i give them !
please , can i have nine ?
you know what ? i &apos;ll give you nine ...
because it &apos;s meaningless ,
and i want it to tell all the other paragraphs
out there what happens
when harold gunderson goes after louis litt .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
haven &apos;t you ever seen a mob movie ?
they always let one survive to tell the others .
well , yeah , but paragraphs can &apos;t talk--
okay , whatever . fine . just type this up as agreed ,
and don &apos;t you ever let me see your pasty , norwegian ,
carrot top @-@ wannabe face again .
carrot top is a very underrated comedian
who &apos;s never done anything to anyone .
did you know that harvey was going to ambush stephen on the stand ?
i wouldn &apos;t have stopped him if i did .
and to hell with the ramifications ?
the ramifications for who , edward ?
i didn &apos;t come here to fight with you , jessica .
but stephen didn &apos;t take the most direct hit .
ava did .
you keep talking about how much you care about ava .
but i &apos;ve only just met her .
and you &apos;re the one who did what you did .
i treated you as if you were my own blood .
ava ...
did you do this to me ?
of course i didn &apos;t .
did you keep this from me ?
i want to hear you say it .
i didn &apos;t know until it was too late .
i didn &apos;t want to burden you with what had been done
to get your pipeline ,
and there was nothing i could do to undo it .
burden me ?
what about protecting me ?
well , that &apos;s exactly what i was doing
when i assigned harvey to the case .
and after i was brought up on murder charges ,
rather than tell me ,
you send the very man who committed the crime .
who were you trying not to burden then ?
you once asked me if she knew about her father and i.
in those days , to be a lawyer and to be out--
not possible .
her father was in the oil business .
he would have been finished .
what does that have to do--
we used to go away on occasion .
in order to do that ,
ava joined us and pretended to be my girlfriend .
she did that for us .
ava is family to me .
i sent stephen out there to help her .
i didn &apos;t know what he &apos;d do .
and i would give anything to undo it .
what do you want from me , edward ?
i want you to put aside your anger
and figure out a way to help .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m here to put aside my anger .
we &apos;re in the middle of a murder trial .
we can spare five minutes for this .
wait a second .
i gave you that bottle when you took over from daniel .
i know .
i told you to only open it in case of an emergency .
you think this isn &apos;t an emergency ?
we &apos;re about to lose a huge murder case ,
and it turns out the person behind it
is one of our own lawyers .
and we &apos;re in business
with the man who helped cover it up .
but the thing that &apos;s been most on my mind
is that you goddamn betrayed me .
now ...
the truth is , you warned me about all of this .
and i am tired of feeling betrayed by you .
i &apos;d rather forgive you .
can you ?
why do you think i &apos;m here .
i never should have come after you .
i &apos;m sorry .
you didn &apos;t kill anybody .
and if i &apos;m really going to forgive you ,
then i need to tell you i &apos;m sorry
that i made you want to do it in the first place .
what changed your mind ?
edward .
he said ava was family to him .
you &apos;re family to me ,
and you did what he didn &apos;t .
you came clean .
is that all you came here to tell me ?
like you said , we &apos;re in the middle of a murder trial .
and you have an idea .
we &apos;re not the only people
that are like family to each other .
and sometimes you have to put your family
in a position where they don &apos;t have a choice .
what do you need me to do ?
new plan--we &apos;re gonna convince that ava &apos;s innocent .
have you been drinking ?
yeah . why ?
because wasn &apos;t that the old plan ?
that was the old goal .
this time , it &apos;s you who &apos;s going to cameron .
if he won &apos;t hear the truth from you ,
how &apos;s he gonna hear it from me ?
cameron can &apos;t see the truth because all he sees
is that he has a winnable case .
how does that affect what i just said ?
prosecutors are hammers ,
and they see the accused as nails .
how am i gonna change that ?
you &apos;re gonna remind him
about the time he hit the wrong nail .
can you tell me how the waffles are here ?
mike ross , my man .
it &apos;s good to see you , man .
it &apos;s good to see you too , clifford .
what the hell you doing out in the middle of the night ?
oh , you know , i told you .
i got an urge for some waffles .
this isn &apos;t a coincidence , is it ?
i need a favor .
no doubt . what you need ?
i need you to talk to cameron dennis .
no .
hell , no .
clifford ...
look at me , man .
look where i am ...
cleaning up people &apos;s shit !
i know .
you know this is all i can get because of him ?
my life passed me by because of that motherf ....
i get in a room with him , i &apos;ll kill him .
and i need you to tell him all of that
so that he doesn &apos;t do the same thing to somebody else .
you need ?
i know who &quot; you &quot; is .
and i don &apos;t owe harvey shit .
now , he may have got me out ,
but he and cameron put me there in the first place .
yeah , you &apos;re right . you don &apos;t owe harvey .
but you do owe me ...
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t have anything to do with putting you in there ,
but i broke the law to get you out .
i am feeling generous ,
so absolutely , 100 % ,
without a doubt , go screw yourself .
everything okay ?
yeah , of course .
i was just using tactic number 36
in louis litt &apos;s handbook , due to be published never .
because i don &apos;t share my tactics .
tactic number seven , by the way .
okay .
well , whatever tactic you used on harold didn &apos;t work .
he &apos;s not caving .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about ,
because he gave me everything i wanted .
the client just called .
the contract harold sent over has a loophole in it .
it leaves him open to punitive damages .
paragraph nine .
get that contract back .
we need to renegotiate .
oh , my god , harold pulled one over on you .
don &apos;t you dare say that out loud .
call him up , set up the appointment for me to go over there .
i tried .
he insisted on coming here . he &apos;s on his way right now .
what the hell are you doing here ?
he &apos;s here to tell you who you are .
i know who i am .
i don &apos;t need to hear it from him .
you think i &apos;m giving you a choice ?
okay . we were supposed to meet in the conference room .
i don &apos;t need to wait in the conference room
to knock your dick in the dirt .
what &apos;d you just say to me ?
it &apos;s from the breakfast club , asshole .
not all of us only watch the sound of music .
you little bastard . you just crossed a line .
julie andrews is a national treasure .
maybe your client would be better off with her .
maybe they would be .
but she isn &apos;t here . and i am .
and here are a few of my favorite things ...
countersuit for slander ,
motion to decertify class ,
motion for summary judgment ,
change of venue , sanctions ,
depositions , discovery !
great use of folders there , louis .
too bad none of them are gonna work .
well , they may not work on the case ,
but they &apos;re definitely gonna work on you .
what are you talking about ?
oh , i &apos;m talking about you may win in the end ,
but it won &apos;t justify
you spending every waking minute of your life on this bullshit ,
instead of doing everything else you &apos;ve been assigned to do .
you &apos;d do that to me ?
i won &apos;t be doing it to you .
i &apos;ll be doing it for bratton gould .
and you &apos;ll be laughed out of there
the same way you were laughed out of here .
louis ...
we got nothing left to say !
drop the suit by the end of the week ,
or one of my associates will see you in court .
get out !
i don &apos;t want him here .
ava , whatever he did , he &apos;s here to help ,
and he &apos;s an asset .
then what does the mighty edward darby have to say ?
you &apos;re innocent until proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt .
take the stand .
any juror that hears you will have that doubt .
she opens that door , the first question cameron asks is ,
did she try and bribe those witnesses ?
the answer is yes . there goes reasonable doubt .
how much did you pay him ?
cameron .
pay who ?
don &apos;t play dumb . clifford danner .
who the hell is clifford danner ?
he was an innocent person that cameron put behind bars .
and i thought he would make you see reason .
that has nothing to do with this .
and i didn &apos;t put him behind bars ... you did .
then i got him out .
well , you &apos;re not getting her out , because she did it ,
and yesterday your own colleague said that she did it .
he did not say that , and you know it .
you willing to take that risk ?
what are you suggesting ?
i &apos;ve worked with him long enough to know what he &apos;s suggesting .
cameron dennis doesn &apos;t go to verdict .
he cuts deals .
then let me tell you ... about what &apos;s behind door number one ...
eight years .
eight years instead of forever .
leave us alone .
court &apos;s in ten minutes . you have until then .
harvey ...
he &apos;s got us , and you know it .
no , he doesn &apos;t .
she &apos;s not going to prison for one day .
she &apos;s going for the rest of her life
if we don &apos;t take this deal .
i am not losing to him .
you ... your blood feud
or whatever it is you have with that man
is what put the target on my back in the first place .
ava , we need to face reality .
she is not taking that deal .
she better , because she can &apos;t buy her way out of it .
and you can &apos;t cover up your way out of it .
i don &apos;t care .
well , what &apos;s your idea ?
because unless you &apos;re gonna testify
that stephen did this without ava &apos;s knowledge ,
you can &apos;t help .
and as you said , you have no proof .
so why don &apos;t you get out of the room and let the grown @-@ ups talk ?
what if i was to testify to that ?
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about putting words to a conversation
that should have happened but didn &apos;t .
you &apos;d say that you confronted stephen , and he admitted it ?
i made this mess . it &apos;s up to me to clear it up .
this isn &apos;t gonna help .
you &apos;re her old friend coming to her aid at the last second .
it &apos;s a lie .
the jury will see right through it .
then we need to make cameron believe it .
harvey , cameron wants a win .
you need to convince him this is a win .
can you do that ?
i guess it &apos;s the best shot we have .
i knew you &apos;d care .
and with five minutes to spare .
we &apos;re not here to take your offer , cameron .
we want you to take ours .
nah , i &apos;m not negotiating . eight years is final .
this isn &apos;t about making a deal for ava .
it &apos;s about making a deal for me .
if he &apos;s got something to say about this ,
you should put him on the stand .
i already trusted you once . i need your word .
go ahead . off the record .
i instructed stephen huntley to do whatever it took
to get ava her pipeline ,
and i told him to do it behind her back .
so you authorized these murders .
absolutely not .
when i heard people had been killed ,
i confronted him immediately .
and what did he say ?
he didn &apos;t care that he &apos;d resorted to murder .
his job was to get things done .
you just admitted to being an accessory after the fact .
no , he didn &apos;t .
i get it . off the record .
what do you want ?
edward pleads to obstruction of justice--
five years probation .
you drop the charges against ava .
and he testifies
at stephen huntley &apos;s murder trial .
and why would i swap out ava for her minion ?
cameron , you gave us that offer for a reason .
you &apos;re at the finish line-- you can taste the win ,
but it &apos;s not 100 % , and you know it ,
because you &apos;re still banking on an admitted murderer
with an incentive to lie .
i &apos;m giving you a respected lawyer
with an incentive to keep his mouth shut .
you know who has a better chance
at getting you a win .
draw up the paperwork .
i thought you never wanted to see me again .
i thought about what you said .
what , about the kind of business your firm does ?
yes .
and i realized that maybe you &apos;re not as bad as i said you were .
no ?
no .
you &apos;re much worse .
harvey and cameron made a deal to take you down ,
and part of that deal was that i got to be the one to tell you about it .
i meant it when i said i never meant to hurt you .
and i meant it when i said that you make me sick .
it &apos;s all there .
you testify , you get five years probation .
and he pleads obstruction of justice .
what is this ?
what is what ?
this says that i forfeit my license
to practice law in this country .
oh , that--that &apos;s just something i added in .
this is unacceptable .
wait a minute .
how could you add that in if we did the paperwork ?
and if he can &apos;t practice law in the country ,
he can &apos;t be a member of our firm .
we must have agreed to it in advance .
you set this whole thing up .
jessica set this whole thing up .
but what &apos;s it matter ?
you really gonna put this on ava
when you can get off with a slap on the wrist ?
i asked you to put aside your anger .
i did . you said ava was family .
the thing about family is they make it easy
to put you in the position where you don &apos;t have a choice .
now , you gonna sign the deal ,
or do i just pick up the trial right where we left off ?
you &apos;re doing the right thing , edward .
we &apos;ll worry about the terms of our dissolution tomorrow .
and , edward ...
we may be getting a divorce ,
but i fully intend on keeping ownership of the house .
who &apos;d have thought we &apos;d end up here ?
i did .
no , you didn &apos;t .
you took a chance with clifford danner ,
and you know it .
it wasn &apos;t a chance .
i played the man .
and , cameron , you &apos;re not only about winning .
you &apos;re about putting guilty people away .
nice working with you .
one @-@ time deal .
i guess this means you &apos;re not looking for another name partner ?
good @-@ bye , cameron .
norma said you had something for me ?
i do .
he dropped it . i win .
do you ?
what ? what are you talking about ?
why do you hate harold so much ?
i don &apos;t hate him .
yeah , you do ...
because i &apos;ve never seen you be as mean to anyone as you are to him .
rachel , i--
don &apos;t &quot; rachel &quot; me . he &apos;s a human being .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
when i was a kid in gym class ...
we had to climb the rope .
every day i tried really hard ,
and every day ...
everyone would laugh at me .
the one thing in my life that i &apos;ve always been great at
is training the associates ...
except for harold .
he &apos;s my failure .
and every time i look at him , it ...
puts me right back in gym class .
louis ...
harold &apos;s climbing that rope .
he &apos;s succeeding .
and the way you got this victory
was by going after his career .
and you &apos;re just yanking him right back down .
we never got this .
send back his original offer marked &quot; accepted . &quot;
i never want this spoken of again .
you never want what spoken of again ?
harvey , what did ava have to say ?
she &apos;d already left for the airport .
someone saves my life , i might stop to say thank you .
you really blame her
after what this firm put her through ?
when you put it that way ...
it doesn &apos;t matter . it was a huge win .
go celebrate .
don &apos;t you mean &quot; let &apos;s go celebrate &quot; ?
am i really the person you wanna celebrate
this big murder trial victory with ?
i don &apos;t know . it depends who you put out .
why don &apos;t you just ask rachel ?
that &apos;s not funny .
harvey .
donna .
how does it go ?
as well as it could .
harvey .
thank you .
why don &apos;t you keep the car ?
