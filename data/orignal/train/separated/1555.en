So, how long are you guys gonna be here for?
I have no idea.
It's not really up to me.
You're not jealous, are you?
Of Callie? No.
I don't think this is a good idea.
'Cause of Mariana?
Do you honestly think that she's gonna care?
I know she is. She told me.
So that's it. We're just gonna do whatever Mariana wants?
I want everyone
write about guilt in their journals.
Don't worry. No one's gonna read it.
It's just for you to get in the habit of writing every day.
She read my journal.
No, I didn't.
You wrote about Liam?
I have to write a story,
and I need a name for the bad guy.
How about Liam?
Whoa, leave yourself some room to breathe, sweetheart.
Come on, I don't need to breathe.
Yes, you do.
Do you think the top is too...
Busty?
Boring?
Right?
You should jewel it.
Ah, si.
Uh, does that cost more?
Un poco.
Un poco.
Por favor, mama?
Gosh, OK.
Como?
She's asking if your father's tie is going to match
with your dress for the father-daughter dance.
Ah, que bueno.
Uh, so you can dance with a padrino or...
a close friend de la familia.
She's dancing with her moms. Right?
Hey! Sorry, I'm late!
Hi, sweetie.
So, oh my goodness, you look beautiful, sweetheart!
Did you see her face when Stef walked up in her uniform?
Hilarious.
I hate when people say "Bueno,"
like you need their approval for something.
When you tell people that you have a mom and dad,
they don't say, "How wonderful."
Who cares?
I wish I had two moms throwing me a quinceanera.
My parents refuse and we're Latino.
I mean, so are you, but you know what I mean.
Yeah, totally.
I just want this to be like, the party that
everybody talks about for the whole rest of high school.
You know what you need...
Three hundred dollars?
Shh.
For a dress she's only going to wear once?
We'll cut it short and she can wear it to prom.
We're spending a fortune on this party.
It's not just a party,
and we already set this money aside.
Yes, before we had two more mouths to feed.
Love, I'm just asking can we just rein it in, please?
Did you talk to her about the Kelsey situation?
Yes, I did.
And how did that go?
So, Lexi and I were talking...
can we get a bubble machine for the party?
No.
Sure.
Sure.
Yes.
第一季第四集
Make them thinner than that, sweetheart...
I'm just making sure you have Mariana's playlist...
Good job, buddy.
...nothing
too provocative or with any explicit lyrics.
What's for dinner?
Not chips, my friend.
Hey, can Talya stay for dinner?
Ooh, Lexi, too?
Sure.
Hey Callie, how was your day?
Uh, it was good.
Uh, so Callie, you know my friend Kelsey?
Oh, the one who lied and said I sold her drugs?
Yeah, well she's in rehab.
I'm sorry to hear that.
So, do you want to take her place in my court?
I think that is a great idea, Mariana.
Um, what do you think, Callie?
Uh, sure, I guess.
Great.
We'll just have to hurry
and get your gown fitted before Saturday.
I have to wear a gown?
Well, you don't have to do anything.
And we get to do a waltz.
It's going to be fun.
Like eating glass.
Hey, shut it.
So, who does Callie get to dance with?
Brandon.
Yeah, I mean, but... you're my date.
Well, duh.
Hey, B? Hey.
Yeah?
Everything OK with you and Talya?
Yeah, why wouldn't it be?
I don't know, just...
Brandon, listen.
You know that, I'm assuming that you know that...
Well, you know, foster siblings are not allowed to...
Hook up? I don't know what you guys call it these days?
There's nothing going on between Callie and I.
Callie and me.
Yeah, OK.
It's just, when the twins got here you were nine.
Right, and now I'm a horny teenager.
Yes.
Mom, I have a girlfriend and I know the rules.
Ok.
Ok.
Will you do me a favor and take these to your brother?
Tell him to please stop leaving his crap around the house.
Crap is not a bad word.
It's not a nice word.
Well, give me a word to say then.
How's your mom?
She's fine.
Yeah?
She's taking a shuttle from the airport tomorrow.
Well, that's good. That'll help us, right?
Yeah, what would help us is if she wasn't coming at all.
Oh, my gosh.
I'll never understand why Dana stresses you out so much.
She's nothing but lovely to me.
You're not her daughter.
Speaking of daughters,
I think ours might be feeling a little embarrassed.
About what?
About dancing with us at her party.
Did she say something to you?
No.
Well, stop projecting.
Mariana's always been very proud of us, really.
She's fine.
Should I have Mariachi?
That's traditional.
So is having a Catholic mass and you're not doing that.
用面饼和葡萄酒表示耶稣的身体和血来祭祀天主
Yeah, true.
What about the shoe ceremony?
Uh-uh. No.
A doll thing?
My mom's going to be here any minute.
I'm going to go use the ladies' room.
The ladies' room?
Hey, so I know your moms
made you ask me to be in your party.
So, I can tell them I don't want to do it.
I don't know. Whatever. If you don't want to.
No, it's not that I don't want to.
It's if you don't want me to.
I don't mind.
You know, you don't have to.
No, I know I don't have to.
OK, well, it's up to you.
OK. Well, then yeah.
But I don't know how to waltz.
Well, neither do I.
A friend of our moms is teaching us.
Cool.
Cool.
I'm in here.
Hey!
You didn't lock the door?
I'm sorry.
I hate sneaking around like this.
But, it's kind of hot.
I mean it.
Fine, let's tell her now.
Not before her party.
After.
I shouldn't even be doing this.
Yes, you should.
I have to go home.
I have to go home.
No, you do not.
Go. Go before Mariana thinks I fell in.
I just wanted to say goodnight to you guys.
And Jude, thank you so much
for helping out with dinner, you did a great job.
Thanks.
Night, Mom.
Hey you, Jesus Foster.
You're being a real sport about Mariana's party, eh?
You're a good brother.
It's OK. Just as long as
I'm the one who gets the car when we turn 16.
Yeah, that's going to happen.
Yeah, what he said.
All right, goodnight you guys.
Thanks for dinner.
Yeah, of course.
What?
Nothing.
Hey, where's Callie?
Bathroom.
Oh, those look fantastic, sweetheart. Good job.
All right, goodnight, lovely.
Mm. Don't stay up late, OK?
OK, goodnight, Mom.
Hey, listen, you know, Mama said something to me,
and I just wanted to check in with you.
You're not embarrassed to dance with us at your party, are you?
That's a sad lunch,
but I guess it beats prison food.
Really? That's your opening line?
I was going to ask about your rap sheet,
but I thought that was rude.
That's where you're supposed to laugh,
and you realize that we're both outsiders who nobody gets.
And then you get my name tattooed on your neck,
until it all goes terribly wrong,
and you have to turn it into a snake
just biting your earlobe.
What do you want from me?
What every guy wants.
Stimulating conversation.
And sex. That's probably off the table, huh?
Look at that smile.
So, listen, some of us are hanging out at the beach
by the pier, Saturday night, you should come.
I can't, I have a thing.
What kind of thing.
The kind that you'd make fun of if I told you.
When your thing gets boring...
You know where to find me.
Don't be shy. Place your right hand on your partner's waist.
And slightly around to the small of her back.
Extend the left hand.
Palm raised.
Callie, rest your hand gently in his.
Other hand, up on his shoulder like so.
A little closer.
Good, hold that position.
In partner dancing, connection is key.
So, Brandon and Callie, look into each others eyes.
Breathe.
Connect. And you two.
And over here. Right hand, on her waist.
Left hand...
Everyone? Gram's here!
Dana, you made it.
Of course I made it.
Good to see you.
Oh, hello beautiful.
Hi Mom.
Oh, your skin looks good.
You've been moisturizing, but my God,
you're pale. Baby, you need some sun.
Yeah, but she's gorgeous. Look at her.
Of course, she's gorgeous.
Gram!
And there's my beautiful birthday girl.
Oh, and my handsome birthday boy!
Your grandfather's very sorry he couldn't be here,
because he got stuck in Paris at a conference.
I wish I was stuck in Paris.
You play your cards right and I will take you one day.
Where's my other dashing grandson?
Uh, practice.
Well... You must be Callie.
And you must be Jude.
Yes, ma'am.
It's lovely to meet you both.
Thanks.
Everyone in this house calls me Gram.
Guess what, I've got fabulous presents for your birthdays...
Gotta be out the door in 15!
Wow.
Wow yourself.
Mm, we should dress up for each other more often.
I know.
Or you could check your email.
Oh, I'm sorry, I just...
Everything's done, sweetheart. Let it go.
I just want her party to be perfect.
She's going to be the center of attention.
For Mariana, it don't get no better than that.
OK, you guys need another bathroom.
You look lovely, Dana.
You really do, Mom.
Thank you. It's a miracle because no black woman
can tame the mane in 15 minutes.
Luckily, you don't have that problem.
Yeah, I don't exactly just wake up like this.
Baby, that is a compliment.
OK, gift bags. Enough.
It's good... it's good like that.
Well, you look handsome.
Well, you too... Pretty, I mean.
Oh, right, I think.
Help me with the gift bags. Bring 'em out to the car.
Thanks.
Uh, you need help?
What?
Oh, uh... No. I got it.
You look... nice.
Look at you, hottie.
Well, I should take these to the car.
You look pretty.
You, too.
It really is nice for Mariana to ask you to be in her court.
Seeing as how, you know, this is a temporary situation.
Well, you never know. I mean, they might decide to keep us.
Maybe.
I mean, unless...
What?
They knew something.
Something?
Like what happened with Liam.
You make it a habit of reading other people's journals?
Just people I don't trust.
Going to go help Brandon.
What's going on?
Hey. You look nice.
Oh, thank you. So do you.
That Lena's one lucky lady, huh?
OK.
So, listen...
I wanted to give you this.
Child support? That's great.
It's for Mariana. It's for the party.
Look, I know this is costing you guys a fortune,
and I asked around.
It's tradition for friends
and family to help out with these things.
It's very sweet, Mike.
I... I really do appreciate it, but we can't accept this.
I'm not taking that.
If you don't take it, I'm going to be deeply offended.
And you, of all people,
should know you don't want me deeply offended.
Well, thank you very much.
OK.
Actually, Mike, there is something that you could do for me.
Um, I know it's last minute, but Mariana has actually asked
if you would do the father-daughter dance with her.
Really?
Yeah.
Seriously, me?
Yeah.
Wow. Yeah, of course. I'd be honored.
OK.
I mean, you OK with that?
Yeah, well, apparently dancing with your two moms
is not exactly quince tradition, so...
just roll with the punches.
What about Lena?
Oh no, it's fine, really.
We want her to have the
party she wants and this is what she wants.
OK, well, she's lucky to have you two.
You're great moms.
That hurt to say, didn't it.
No, not at all. Hey, look at you in your penguin suit.
Huh?
Never mind.
If I'm going to cut a rug with Mariana,
I'm going to need a little liquid courage.
Ok.
Wait, Mariana is dancing with Mike?
I thought she was dancing with you two.
It's fine, Jesus.
Will you please finish up this table for me?
Thanks, love.
Ok.
You look like a princess.
I feel like I'm going to throw up.
What if it's no fun?
What if I trip and fall on my face?
You won't, and it's going to be amazing.
What is that?
Your birthday present.
I wanted you to open it first.
Help me open it.
Oh, my God. Did you do this all yourself?
Where did you get this picture?
Your moms.
I loved that dress!
She was new to our school
and she wore this princess dress every day for like a month.
I was obsessed with Belle.
And one day she fell on the playground and ripped it.
And I burst into tears.
Never mind the fact that her knee was all bloody.
It was humiliating. Everybody laughed at me, except for Lexi.
She helped me up and took me to the nurse's office.
You were my first friend.
And best friend.
Thank you. I love you.
I love you.
Can I interrupt?
I'm going to go get everybody together.
I'll see you out there.
Me, too.
Honey, you look beautiful.
Thank you.
So, what's in the box?
Open it and see.
Oh, my God, it's gorgeous.
Every girl wears a tiara on her quinces.
Oh God, it looks so expensive.
It was, don't tell Mom.
Thank you.
Beautiful, beautiful.
She's my best friend.
So?
So, I'm not thinking about her feelings, I'm being selfish.
What are you talking about right now?
You're not being selfish. Mariana's the selfish one.
My mom's just spending a bunch of money on this stupid party,
she's not even dancing with them.
You know what else? She's still in contact with our birth mom.
After I saved her ass.
We're not ending this.
Don't do this.
I'm sorry.
Hi honey, did you find Lexi?
No.
You OK?
I'm fine.
Hey, have you seen Lexi?
No.
Sorry, I was in the bathroom.
You're going to the bathroom a lot lately.
Maybe you have a bladder infection.
Mariana?
Here sweetie, on your left wrist.
OK, everybody, couple up.
The DJ's going to announce the court,
and then Mariana and Jesus, you'll make your grand entrance.
You all look wonderful, beautiful, handsome.
Good luck. Come on, Talya.
Ready?
All right.
What are you doing?
I think we should switch.
Sam's too tall for Lexi.
Works for me.
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Mariana's quinceanera!
Now, can I have everyone please rise
and give a warm welcome as you receive her court.
Starting with Lexi Rivera and Sam Wilkins.
Let's keep it going with Callie Jacob and Brandon Foster!
Relax, this is your big moment.
And now, the moment we've all been waiting for,
ladies and gentlemen,
Mariana Foster and her brother Jesus Foster.
But first we'd like to kick things off
with the traditional padrino dance.
Please welcome family friend, Mike Foster.
Is Mariana OK?
She's fine.
Hey, what was that about? Did I do something?
You need to tell your girlfriend to chill.
Why, what she'd do?
She thinks I have a thing for you.
What... she said that?
Can you just tell her that she has nothing to worry about?
Please?
Very nice.
At this time, we'd like to welcome
Mariana's court to the dance floor
for the traditional Viennese Waltz.
All right, you're dancing with me. Come on.
I know.
Know what?
About you and Lexi.
Dance.
We didn't want to tell you.
We didn't want to ruin your party.
Well, you did.
OK, forget what I said about Talya.
I'm sorry.
You have nothing to be sorry about.
I don't get why it's such a big deal.
This doesn't change anything.
You could have any girl you wanted.
Why'd it have to be my best friend?
Can we have everyone back to the dance floor, please?
What do you say, Dana? You want to get your groove on?
Why not.
Come on.
Oh, I don't know who should be more scared!
That's right.
Oh no, do we have to?
Yes.
You guys are so great.
Um, I'm thirsty.
Mariana.
I have nothing to say to you.
Mariana, wait.
Brandon.
Brandon? What is going on?
Don't play dumb with me.
Callie told me what you did.
OK, I read her journal because...
Wait, wait. You read her journal?
Yes, and I'm glad I did...
I can't believe you.
There are things you that you don't...
No. Shut up!
Just listen to...
I can't do this anymore!
I'm done.
Please...
Fine, but ask her.
Ask her about Liam.
Mariana.
Can we talk?
Talk about what?
How my best friend and brother lied to me?
We didn't lie to you, we just didn't tell you.
Same thing.
And you know what hurts the most?
Hearing all the awful things that Jesus said about me.
And you didn't even defend me.
That's not what a best friend does.
Yeah, I'll have another double. Neat.
You got it.
Hey, two white wines, please.
Hope you're pacing yourself, Mike.
It's a party, Stef. Have some fun.
This is a lovely party.
Thanks.
I know money's been tough for you and Stef...
Mom, we're fine.
I know you're fine,
but with two more mouths to feed,
this is a lot to spend on a birthday party.
Well, it's not just a birthday party.
This is about Mariana embracing her cultural heritage.
About being part of the Latino community.
Which, of course, she isn't.
I'm just saying being that Latina isn't
just about the color of her skin.
But being black is.
What?
For you being black has always been about
the color of a person's skin.
That's not true.
Yes, it is.
All I've ever said is that dark skinned people,
have a different experience than light skinned ones.
And by different, you mean more authentic.
I mean harder.
Honey, dark skinned people face more discrimination.
That is just a fact of life.
So, maybe we are trying
to make up for what we couldn't give Mariana.
But I understand how she feels.
Do you now?
You were raised by a black mother.
And by a white father.
And I never felt accepted by either community, Mom.
Well, I'm so sorry if you had such a tough time
being a beautiful light skinned woman...
Oh, mom...
But like it or not,
the color of your skin has afforded you more
opportunities than anyone like me has ever had.
That is what you've always assumed.
That being biracial has made my life easier.
Because it has.
Like it or not, you will never know what it is like
to be a black woman in America.
Look at the bright side, now we can dance together.
I don't really feel like dancing.
I should go home. Mariana doesn't want me here.
No, I want you here.
It's my birthday, too.
How did she find out?
I don't know.
But look, she's not letting it ruin her party.
We shouldn't let it ruin ours.
What's that about?
They have a thing for each other.
How do you know?
I pay attention.
They're not going to keep us, you know.
What are you talking about?
Brandon.
OK, Jude? I'm not stupid, OK?
But sometimes you do stupid things.
Excuse me. Do you want to dance?
Go.
Hey, I've been looking all over for you.
Is one of those for me?
Is one going to be enough?
There's not enough wine in this world.
This about your mom?
She just told me
I don't know what it's like to be a black woman.
She's not right, you know that.
She's right about one thing,
and that's why I wanted to have this party for Mariana,
and why I don't give a damn how much it costs,
because I understand what that's like.
Not knowing where you belong.
I felt like that my entire life.
You know where you belong.
I shouldn't be doing this.
This is Mariana's party.
Hey. Hey. Hey. Listen to me.
This is her party but you can cry if you want to.
I love you.
Can I have everyone's attention?
Can everyone please find their seat?
And can I have Stef and Lena join us on the dance floor?
Mariana, your moms have something they'd like to say to you.
OK, first of all, Jesus, will you please come join your sister?
OK, first we want to thank all of our friends and family
for coming to join us and celebrating this
very, very special birthday today. Thank you.
Our babies are 15! Could you believe this?
To our beloved Jesus and Mariana,
you have brought so much joy and love to your moms,
and to your brother Brandon's life as well.
He begged us and begged us for a brother or a sister,
and got both in one fell swoop.
Um, we love you so very much,
and since a picture is worth a thousand words,
I'm going to shut up and we're going to watch this.
So, go over there.
OK, and Jesus,
just so you don't think we forgot about you...
Happy birthday!
Not in the house, young man.
Thank you so much.
Now, may I please have the rest of the family
up here for a photo, please?
Come on.
Come on, Callie and Jude.
Callie, come on.
All right, Fosters.
Come on.
Everyone together now.
Closer...
All right.
Scooch in. Everyone scooch in.
One, two, three.
Look at that.
Smile!
Honey, it's a beautiful party.
What happened to Talya?
She left.
Are you OK?
Nope.
I broke up with Talya.
Because of me.
No, no, I...
I mean, I'm sure that's what she thinks, but it's not.
I broke up with her because she's doing stupid things.
Like reading your journal.
She told you.
She didn't tell me what it said.
I didn't want to hear it.
Callie, I already know everything I need to know about you.
Callie? Hey.
Callie? Callie, wait.
Hey! Brandon?
You haven't said boo to your old man all night.
Sorry.
Don't be sorry.
Come here, come here.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I love you so much. Look at you, hm?
You're a man, now. You're all grown up.
I wish...
What?
I wish I could do it all over again.
Dad.
OK, I know it's a party, so go have fun.
I'm going to go home.
Ah, I think I should drive you home.
I think you're right.
I am a police officer,
and I have an example to set for
the fine people I protect and serve.
I'm this way.
All right.
Mariana? Some of your guests are starting to leave.
What's the matter? Aren't you having a good time?
I'm sorry.
For what?
For being selfish.
Honey, what are you talking about?
This party.
It cost so much and you both worked so hard.
I didn't dance with you. I should've danced with you.
I have the best moms in the world
and I should've danced with you.
Baby.
Honey, it's OK.
No, it's not.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You know what you need?
A mama sandwich!
No!
Yes! Mommy sandwich!
We love you.
I love you, too.
Lexi, I'm not letting you leave here
without dancing with me.
Did I say it was formal?
I just assumed.
You look dumb in that dress.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Do you want a beer?
