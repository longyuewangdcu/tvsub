No. No. No!
No, mommy, don't let him get me.
Sam! He ruined my picture, mom.
It's Ok, honey. We'll make another one.
我说过别让他睡觉前太兴奋
We're just playing.
We have got a 12-hour car ride tomorrow.
Now he's gonna be up half the night.
去把本叫回来
But my picture!
You can work on it tomorrow in the car, honey.
On the way to Disney World.
好
Disney World!
我是家里唯一的成年人
Well, isn't that what you love about me?
Every once in a while
I would like a tiny bit of help, Mr. Crawford.
You got it, Mrs. Crawford.
Thank you.
Ben!
Ben, where are you?
Where are you, Ben?
Benny! Where are you?
Ben!
He's not coming, dad.
Good boy, Ben.
Hey, Sam.
Just let him sleep with us.
怎么了
I love you.
I love you, too, kiddo.
The is WDCW 88.8 on your dial.
Good morning folks.
It's time to get out, get out there and enjoy this day.
有清新的东风吹过
You can expect a high near 75 degrees.
Clear tonight with a low near 61.
Chris.
Sam?

我们得像狐狸一样狡猾
Crawford family. Butchered in their home.
Murder/suicides?
That's what we have to find out.
He's so gorgeous.
Thank you.
If you find baldness and wrinkles attractive.
Look at his little witty bitty nose.
Don't you want one of these?
Mm. I'll stick to practicing.
Congratulations.
Thanks. She's amazing.
I'm a little terrified.
Well, uh, we should get going.
Pleasure seeing you, Mrs. Hotchner.

最坏的情况
Crawford family. Murdered 3 days ago.
Saw it on the news.
They were found in the basement of their house.
Bags packed for a vacation they never took.
Report said it was a murder/suicide.
Father stabbed the mom, then shot himself.
That's the conclusion Maryland State police came to.
The gun was found next to the father.
Had gunpowder residue on his right hand.
And now you must have some compelling reason
没有杀害他全家
Yeah. Another murdered family.
尸体在一个月前被发现
The mother Reese Miller,
her 2 children, and her new husband.
Again, they were found in the basement
也是收拾了行李准备度假
Both cases, the bodies were discovered
5 days after their vacations were supposed to have started.
只有24小时
这两家人都还在家里
Location of the bodies, both cases, the basement.
That indicates a level of organization.
就显得无组织了
If these aren't murder/suicides
someone's doing a damn good job of making them look like it.
埃里克·米勒
Biological father of the Miller children.
Arlington P.D. issued a BOLO for Miller
after the bodies were discovered.
Ex-wife Reese Miller had a restraining order
against him for domestic violence.
When she get re-married?
The week before they were killed.
妻儿是属于自己的财产
Reese Miller getting re-married possibly made him snap.
Well, the Virginia cops finally
located Eric Miller last night
responding to a drunken disturbance at a motel
where Miller had been hiding out.
When they found him
they discovered blood on his black leather jacket.
Belonged to his children.
Was any of his DNA found at the Crawford house?
No.
Did he know the Crawfords?
If he does, he's not saying.
他就没说过一句话
Uh, the Arlington P.D. have asked us to interview him.
If anyone could apply overwhelming force, he's your man.
I want you to find out. Talk to him.
You want me to talk to him?
你就曾审讯过
You can go solo.
克劳福德家是最新的犯罪现场
Once the Crawfords were brought down to this basement
they must have known their fate.
M.E. said they were all killed down here.
艾米莉在那里
我是怎么做到的
Well, I had to bring 'em down here first.
How?
I had a gun.
接下来呢
先刺谁
The strongest, the father.
He was found right there, and then the mother.
That's her right there.
How you gonna keep the kids from running away?
Restraints.
Can't aim a gun at them and stab the mother at the same time.
No restraints were found on the victims.
Because I took them with me.
No ligature marks were found.
Let's go upstairs. See how they lived.
Sam Crawford. White male.
Age 5. Multiple stab wounds.
Laceration to the left ventricle.
No defensive wounds present.
Allison Crawford. White female.
32. Multiple stab wounds.
C.O.D.- Exsanguination.
Emily Crawford. White female.
8. Multiple stab wounds.
C.O.D.- Exsanguination.
白人男性 36岁

Where's his wedding ring?
It's not listed in his personal effects.
那么戒指去哪里了
I'm Dr. Spencer Reid from the FBI.
I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.
You got something you wanna ask me, boy?
You look me in the eye, and you ask.
Three days ago...
You're not looking at me.
Three days ago, the Crawford family was murdered.
Is that right?
Did you know them?
What are you getting at?
They were killed in the exact same way that your family was killed.
And?
弗吉尼亚警察刑讯逼供
What makes you think a damn photo is gonna scare me?
Is that what this is about, hmm?
You think I'm crazy, man?
You think I suddenly snapped
and I slaughtered my own wife and kids?
You think I did this? Huh?
Is that what you think?
Sit down, now.
Is this your daddy?!
我没什么可说的了
You don't have to talk. Just listen.
On the occasions you assaulted your wife, you were intoxicated.
Once the effects of alcohol wore off
you were overcome by feelings of remorse.
I'm gonna tell you this just one time. You shut your mouth!
相互作用有一定的影响
Your mother was an alcoholic
and she was often too drunk
to stop the beatings that your father gave you.
他还没说完
Age 6, you were orphaned to a family
where the abuse continued
only this time, it was sexual.
You shut your mouth, or I'm gonna rip your face off.
The abuse continued well into puberty
but my one concern is, Eric
继续这种恶心循环
I never laid a hand on my children.
You hear me?!
I hear you.
I found them like that.
Dead. Bloodied. My babies.
My sweet, little babies.
I was crazy out of my mind. I didn't know what to do.
而事实确实如此
So you ran?
So what've I got now?
You have your innocence.
For the sake of your children
I believe that they, at the very least, deserve the truth.
I can't get... the image of my dead children out of my mind.
Ty, my little boy
he was clutching a... a piece of paper.
I think it was a drawing.
May- maybe a painting.
里德博士
Interesting interrogation technique.
What did you hope to accomplish?
而且很不友善
I needed a way in.
他杀害了自己的家人
and I know he still loved his wife.
Why do you say that?
Even though they were divorced
he's still wore the wedding ring.
The yard is overgrown.
都该保养了
and Allison Crawford's SUV is in pristine condition.
Says here that Allison drove the kids to school.
If they were educated privately
maybe the car was just an attempt to show the other parents wealth.
Like this house.
Designer magazines conspicuously placed
expensive modern furniture, plasma TV.
Behind the curtains, water damage.
Allison spent money on the things her friends could see
and neglected those they couldn't.
The Crawfords lived beyond their means.
So, where'd the extra cash come from?
Get Garcia to check their financial status.
"Emily."
This painting is of this house.
Strange for a child. It has no color.
Has lines, dimensions, but no color.
No dog collar was found, right?
Maybe the dog didn't have one.
Mm-hmm. He'd have to have one.
Come here.
See that?
This dog door opens automatically
via a chip in the dog's collar.
If anything attempted to get in without one...
The alarm would've been activated.
When the cops got here, the house was locked tight
and the alarm was hot.
So the night the Crawfords were murdered
the only way in or out was with the dog collar.
杀了这家人
Chris Crawford was a black belt in judo.
So are you.
I've got a gun to your back.
Maybe you could take it from me.
But your children are in the same room.
And if you fail, they die.
Does it matter how big I am now?
艾莉森·克劳福德都会竭力反抗
Emily and Sam would've been sobbing.
Crawford didn't kill his family.
甚至可能根本不认识
求求你 救救我
别这样 求你了 不要
What are you doing?
Why didn't anyone hear them scream?
I believe the unsub had control of this family.
He may have separated each family member.
我就杀了你的孩子"
我就杀了你们的妈妈"
控制他们的方法
Based on lividity...
the M.E. estimates that the father was the last to die.
Which means he witnessed the whole thing.
If he did spend time with both families
他有时间与他们待在一起
'Cause he knew they were goin' on vacation.
Look at travel agents, relatives, work colleagues
contract workers, children's tutors.
克劳福德家的财政状况了
艾莉森·克劳福德的花销
They were in major debt.
And Chris Crawford wrote a number of checks
for a series of visits to a therapist.
She had 2 cell phone accounts...
有一个在华盛顿东南部
You get that?
Federal agents! FBI! Federal agents!
Clear!
That's the cleanest thing in here.
Clear.
What's that?
It's a child's painting. It's a colonial house.
2个孩子在门外手牵手
And a big dog.
上面有艾米莉的签名
他儿子抓着一幅画
He wanted to know what was on it.
What was on it?
His son's blood.
Hotch! Hotch!
Hey. Whoa. Whoa. Easy.
Freeze!
Why am I here?
I think you know why.
That's mine.
一种自信开朗的性格
Shows an above-average intelligence.
The child that painted this was left-handed.
Emily Crawford was left-handed.
Right.
You're not.
How'd you get the painting, Frank?
Forget to take your medicine today, Frank?
这可不好
They make me feel wrong.
Wrong enough to kill the Crawfords?
Frank.
I- I did a-a bad thing.
What did you do?
I shouldn't have gone to the house.
Allison told me not to.
I would never... never hurt Ally.
She's the only family I got.
Family?
She's my sister.
She's dead.
He killed them.
Chris did. I know he did it.
What bad thing did you do?
The rule was... I was never supposed to go to the house.
That was the only rule.
Allison said if Chris saw me...
He would never let me see her again.
He was gonna lock me up in the loony bin.
He never liked me.
You went... to the house.
She said... she couldn't visit me anymore.
I just wanted to see her.
Seeing Allison made everything better
but they cut my phone off.
That day! The day I went to see them!
They cut my phone off!
I never would've gone to the house
if they hadn't cut off the phone!
在没钥匙的情况下进入屋子
对他有偏见
没有
你都做了什么
It was... dark. And- and cold.
透过窗户看屋里
But my breath steamed up the glass
and I wiped it clean, and... and I-
I could see them, sitting down for dinner.
I saw Emily and Sam, and...
Sam was crying.
I guess he was in trouble.
Did you see Allison?
Yeah.
She was saying grace over the table.
And then... she looked up and saw me.
And she mouthed something at me.
I think it was, "get the hell out."
So I left.
Did Chris see you?
No. He wasn't there.
But a friend was at the head of the table.
You said a friend?
I saw someone.
What did this person look like?
I- I didn't see their face... but...tiny.
Really tiny.
White or black, Frank?
I don't know. But...
What?
The hair. It-it... it was red.
If Frank saw them that day
it wasn't Chris Crawford at the table.
Maybe it was the suspect.
And she wasn't saying, "go away."
She was saying, "help me."
It-it wasn't a friend.
Frank.
It wasn't a friend at all.
It was him.
He's the one who killed them.
Frank.
I... I... I... I...
Frank.
No! No! No! No!
Frank. Frank. Frank, Frank, stop.
弗兰克 住手 放开
Frank, calm down!
Frank! Come on!
Both families had a dog.
And both houses had a dog door.
Fielding said that the person he saw was small.
Yeah, well, in order to get through that door
还得非常瘦
"When you have eliminated the impossible

Can I kiss him?
Both of you, out.
明白 谢谢
He's been looking at those pictures all morning.
Well, I sure hope he sees a connection
旅行社 家庭教师
contract workers. I got nothin'.
Why target those families?
Well, to know that, we have to know how.
通常都是技术工人
with above-average intelligence.
High birth status.
And in most cases... male.
In the workplace, he's socially confident.
And with women... sexually confident.
Every offense... is preplanned.
Targeting the victim is almost as pleasurable as the actual kill.
These guys, they're... they're meticulous.
It's a compulsion.
Everything has to have its proper place.
They do exhaustive amounts of research on their victims.
They watch their every move
every last detail is observed.
书上或日记上
When the kids are comin' home from school.
When daddy'll be home.
洗澡时间 睡觉时间
Plan the work... work the plan.
This is the way that he maintains control.
It's also how he personalizes his target...
so nothing's left to chance.
Absolutely nothing...
is left out of place, ever.
So he plans the work...
就执行计划
He takes great pride in his job.
I think the workplace has to be the connection.
Both are by Emily, painted months apart.
This one... is full of color, life.
The one I found at Emily's house has
lines, dimensions. No color.
I believe Emily was coerced to make this.
It's a point of view. It is his point of view.
监视这个家庭
Each of the dead husbands was missing his wedding ring.
This is the unsub's trophy.
因为他失去了自己的家庭
他有机会扮演爸爸的角色
因为没人会过来
because they're supposed to be on vacation.
克里斯·克劳福德穿的衣服内侧
The suspect may have worn the father's clothes to...
Complete the fantasy.
So, why kill them?
'Cause the fantasy can't last.
这个混蛋的信息吗
Wait a minute.
Chris Crawford worked for the IRS.
And... Reese Miller was a secretary at the GAO.
That makes them both government employees.
Let's check out Chris Crawford and Reese Miller.
He had his share of problems at home.
Who doesn't?
But he didn't fix 'em by killin' his family.
Were you aware he was in therapy?
He mentioned a marriage counselor.
He say who?
Nope. And I didn't ask.
I don't like to pry.
真令人惊讶
You mind if we go through Chris's belongings?
See if he had any connection to Miller?
You're welcome to look through anything you like.
Family therapists.
They often use children's paintings to assess the family unit.
We're all still in shock.
Reese was a quiet woman.
上下班准点守时
Brought in her own lunch, and she had 2 kids
but then you knew that.
It's just so terrible. I still can't believe it.
She was covering for one of my women who was on maternity leave.
And she was always tired, you know?
都会很累
He was a mean drunk.
Mrs. Raleigh...
她尽力不表露出来
but concealer can only do so much magic.
I should know.
Mrs. Raleigh.
I'm tired. I'm talking too much.
Do you know if Mrs. Miller was seeing a marriage counselor?
Reese kept pretty much to herself.
You're not betraying any confidence.
We need to know everything about her life.
Every thursday, I covered for her
so she could take off early to see a therapist.
Thought it worked.
She kicked the bastard out, got remarried.
Look what that got her.
人们会议论的
But then talk is cheap.
Not when you're talkin' to a therapist.
给苹果树家庭医疗中心
to the Applewood Family Medical Center.
What about the Millers?
No. Nothin' here.
How about pharmaceuticals?
Nobody gets therapy these days without a healthy dose of medication.
What are you implying, Reid?
That everyone is medicated.
Did you just make a joke?
No. I meant statistics.
里德 下次直接说 是
Now, medication normally requires reimbursement from the HMO
and since she works for the government like you and I
we share the same health care provider.
Are you hacking into the government's HMO database?
Is that legal?
你会死得很惨
Really?
Oh. Right there. Good call, Reid.
Mrs. Reese Miller- diazepam.
Who prescribed the meds?
Dr. R. Howard at the Applewood family center.
Let's find out what he looks like. Here we go.
Dr. Howard isn't a he.
Excellent, Lacey. Really wonderful.
There's so much color. It's very lovely, indeed.
Dr. Rachel Howard?
I'm special agent Aaron Hotchner with the FBI.
Come on, Lacey. Come on, go with mommy.
Can I help you?
I'm agent Jason Gideon, behavioral analysis.
We both deal with the dysfunctional.
结局往往不会像你那么糟
Unless you're the Crawford family.
Or the Millers. You knew them both.
Yes. I knew them, but...
Ma'am.
I think you should take a seat.
Why?
We're gonna have to check your alibi.
Dig all you want. I have 4 teenagers.
If I had any time to myself
it wouldn't be spent killing my clients.
You worked with both families?
I assessed their cases.
This office deals with hundreds of families-- military
cops, lawyers, congressmen, feds.
I only met the Crawfords and Reese Miller once.
But you prescribed medication for them.
I'm the only medical doctor here.
Who'd you hand the cases over to?
Uh, I'll have to check my files.
You don't use a computer?
Not all of us have embraced the technical revolution.
这样让我更有安全感
And please... do not read into that.
The Crawfords.
Karl Arnold dealt with their case.
What about the Millers?
I'd like to see him now.
Well, you can't. He works a 4/40- 4.10-hour days.
He's off today, but he'll be in first thing tomorrow.
Do you have his home address?
I'll get a team out to his house.
In the meantime, we'd like to see his office.
Suspect's cell is goin' straight to voice mail.
Karl's a good man.
That's what everybody says
until they find a body in the basement.
It's locked.
I'll get security.
No. We don't have time for that.
Someone will have to pay for that.
Karl Arnold will.
Gideon.
Where is he now?
I can't believe Karl...
Where is he?
I don't know. If he's not at home,
maybe he's gone to see his family.
He's married?
小卡尔和莎拉
How long ago did the marriage collapse?
About 5 years ago.
那段时间很痛苦 他...
he took some time off work.
He couldn't concentrate. He started...
drinking.
Yeah?
也许你们弄错了
I would've seen...
Oh, my God. I feel sick.
Where does Karl's family live?
She took the kids and moved to Idaho.
They just raided Karl's home.
He's not there.
Cut it out, now, both of you!
Sarah, Karl Jr, go do your homework.
Hello?
Wait. I'm sorry. I can't hear-shh!
What did you say?
我是联邦探员亚伦·霍奇尔
I'd like to know where your ex-husband is.
As long as he's nowhere near me
I don't give a damn.
We really need to find him.
When was the last time you saw him?
I...I haven't seen him in over 2 years.
He...he...he's a scary guy.
But... he did call me about an hour ago.
I wish he would just go to hell and stay there.
What did he say?
家庭有多珍贵之类的话
Did he say where he was?
No. No. He...he just wanted to talk to the kids.
让他想起了我的莎拉
焦虑 不知所措
Seemed like he always is...
angry, controlling, manic.
Do you have any idea where he might be?
但是我听见那边有孩子的声音
And...and...and then someone started to cry.
That's when he hung up.
Thank you.
Arnold just called his wife.
She heard kids in the background.
He's already in another family's house.
Hotch, there's gotta be hundreds of families here.
我们就给每一家派去一名探员
Karl Arnold, he has a boy and a girl
just like the Millers and the Crawfords.
Target family would be the same.
How could I not have seen it?
若非如此
we would have caught him sooner.
Does he have a journal?
随身带着
It's likely he also collects trophies.
If they're not in his house
they're right here, hidden in this room.
What does he mean by trophies?
From the families he killed.
我们需要那些战利品作为证据
一儿一女
Can I see it?
博耶兹一家和邓肯一家
Wait. The Dunkens.
That's not one of his cases. That's mine.
They have a baby boy
and a slightly introverted 8-year-old
named Jackie.
Jackie...
Jackie's work?
He took it from my office.
Were they planning a trip?
To the Adirondacks.
霍奇 把这房间翻个底朝天
Here, take this. I call you some backup.
坐在餐桌周围
FBI! FBI!
He's got my baby!
Ma'am, is he alone?
My baby!
Where's the basement?
Under the stairs!
Son of a bitch.
Get 'em outta here. Get them outta here!
Gideon. Gideon!
Karl?
Karl, it's the FBI.
Karl?
Why don't you give me the baby?
Karl?
Karl, I want you to look at me.
I'm gonna put my gun away...
And I want you to hand me that baby.
Give me the baby.
You move, I'm gonna break your neck.
Hello.
Let's go.
继续走
Did he say anything?
No.
Can we tie him forensically to the other crimes?
Negative on foreign DNA.
He must have washed Crawford's clothes.
Then we'll need a confession.
Can you get one?
Did you do what I asked?
Yeah.
Then maybe.
冰雪聪明 天赋异禀的女孩
阳光有活力的孩子
从院子里观察他们
You learned everything about them
studied their every move
and then you wrote it all down.
May I have a glass of water?
Something wrong?
No, I'm just thirsty.
Water, please.
我对你显然不构成威胁
They stay on.
相类似的那些家庭
恐吓他们
then you killed them... one by one.
We have your journals, Karl.
It's my job...
to write everything down, to get to know them.
我就无法帮助他们
And I make home visits...
因为人们会撒谎
You, of all people, should know that.
糟糕的丈夫和父亲
Allison Crawford hemorrhaged money her husband didn't have.
It can strain any marriage.
On the surface, this looks like any family, USA.
一儿一女
If you look a little closer
却与表象不符
The woman and children are distant from the man.
Their smiles are stiff. Their eyes are frightened.
Every hair is in place, wearing their sunday best
生活在地狱里的人一样
Are you okay?
It isn't right.
What isn't?
You've got the pictures mixed up!
那是山姆·克劳福德的
It should be Ty Miller's!
必须放在正确的位置
This one here?
What the hell have I been trying to tell you?
You're right. They're switched.
和米勒一家放在了一起
but how did you know that, Karl?
And I watched them for a number of days,
always at night.
Saw how they lived. How they loved.
I would keep them apart...
until the last night, till the last supper.
Then I would bring them, one by one...
down to the basement.
The youngest first. The father last.
Why, Karl?
So he could see...
what happens to families
when the head of household... isn't strong.
Wives wither.
Children perish.
But me?
I'm an excellent father.
