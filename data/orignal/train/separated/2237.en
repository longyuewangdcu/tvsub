Hey, kid.
Nice to see you, too.
The storm!
It's okay. We can fix it. I'll talk to Marco.
Do you think it's still here?
What are you looking for?
My book.
Why'd you bury it here?
So my mom doesn't find it.
Hiding it under your mattress wasn't good enough?
That's the first place the evil queen would look.
How about leaving it with me?
That's the second place.
It's still here. Good.
So your mom doesn't know about the castle?
No. This is our secret.
Henry?
Henry.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
You know you have a session with archie this morning.
I should've known he was with you.
Henry, car. Now.
You let him play here?
The storm hit it hard, but we can fix it.
Well, can you fix a cracked cranium?
'Cause that's what you'll have on your hands
if one of these boards collapses under his weight.
You're not thinking about Henry or his safety,
just ways around me.
Ms. Swan, don't let your feelings cloud your judgment.
People can get hurt.
What's that supposed to mean?
You're the sheriff now.
It's time to be responsible.
Don't let my feelings cloud my judgment?
That's all Regina ever does.
She's just upset because
you and Henry have a special place and she...
she doesn't.
How'd she find out about the castle in the first place?
She knows everything about this town. She's the Mayor.
Everything okay?
Yeah, I just need to go.
Look, if it makes you feel any better,
I think you're right.
I see the effect she has on Henry.
I wish everyone else did, too.
I can grant your wish.
Oh, Sidney.
You want a side of bacon with that whiskey?
You want to show this town who the Mayor really is?
I can help.
It's gonna be kinda hard to do from inside her pocket.
The Mayor and I are done.
Sure you are.
She got me fired from the paper.
She made a fool of me in the election.
So I started working on an expose on the mayor's office,
and I found something she didn't want found.
Sidney, you're drunk.
Go home. Sleep it off.
Be grateful you don't have to answer to her anymore.
Call me.
Storybrooke deserves to know the truth about her.
Here we go.
You awakened the Genie of Agrabah.
You're entitled to three wishes--no more, no less.
But you must know that magic has its limits.
You cannot wish for life nor death.
You cannot wish for love. You cannot wish for more wishes.
And once spoken,
a wish cannot be undone, no matter what the consequences.
So... tell me your first wish.
I cannot think of a single thing I desire.
I have everything I need.
I seek nothing more than the happiness
of all who set foot in my kingdom.
You are in my kingdom,
and yet you seem unhappy.
I have served as Genie of the lamp
for longer than you've been alive.
Life as a genie is not as magical as it may appear.
So you wish to be free?
More than anything.
Then I know my first wish.
I wish you to be free.
Can it be?
Am I truly free?
You're the genie. You tell me.
There are two more wishes left in the lamp.
What will you do with them?
For my second wish...
I wish to give my third and final wish to you.
In my time, I have granted 1,001 wishes,
and I have seen them end poorly 1,001 times.
Making a wish comes with a price,
and that is why I will never...
use... this wish.
You are a man of wisdom, genie.
Now tell me--
What will you do with your freedom?
Find the one thing I've always desired,
that my prison has kept from me...
True love.
Then you must come join me at my palace.
I am certain you will find it there.
Come. Meet my family.
Your palace is as lovely as you are kind.
Oh, it's more than kindness, my friend.
This is my beautiful daughter Snow.
How do you do?
And Regina, my wife, the queen.
Hello.
Hey. What happened? I came as soon as I could.
The castle--she's tearing the whole thing down!
My book! I-it's gone!
Congratulations, madame mayor.
You destroyed the thing he loves.
A dangerous thing
that can only hurt Henry and others.
You see me as a villain, Ms. Swan.
But that's just your perception, and you're wrong.
Learn your place in this town,
or soon enough, you won't be in it.
Sidney, hi.
I'm in.
I want everyone to know who she really is.
I got your text. What's going on?
Follow me.
David, you're scaring me. What's wrong?
What's wrong is you're late,
and the wine's getting warm.
We have to stop doing this.
We just started doing it.
We have to figure out what we're doing.
We will.
Tomorrow.
Okay. Tomorrow.
All right, I'm listening.
So what do you know about her?
$50,000.
I'm sorry?
50 grand out of the budget is missing,
and Regina is responsible.
That's it? That's what you have on her?
The money is just the tip of the iceberg.
We figure out what she's doing, it all falls apart,
It all crumbles, and we'll finally learn her secrets.
You see what she is.
I see it.
All we need is a crack in the mirror to show everyone.
I'm telling you, this is it.
All right. What's your plan?
Tap her phone. G.P.S. Her car.
Hack into her e-mail.
Dip into your bail bonds person bag of tricks.
No. I'm sheriff now.
I have to be responsible.
I want to do this by the book.
She's gonna know that you're on to her
sooner than later.
Are you prepared for her wrath?
Oh, yeah.
Good. Because I wasn't.
If you thought she was so terrifying...
how did you allow yourself to end up in her pocket?
I used to think she was a different person.
Happy birthday, your majesty.
No gifts are required to mark this special day,
for they all pale
in comparison to the greatest gift of all--
my daughter Snow.
Father.
Father. You make me blush.
Every day I look upon your face,
and I am reminded of your dearly departed mother...
who, like you,
truly was...
the fairest in all the land.
Not in a festive mood?
No one seems to notice my absence.
I noticed.
Such a lovely tree.
Yes, it's from my childhood garden.
The tree and I share something in common.
Neither of us can leave the palace
and neither of us truly belongs.
No matter how hard I try to please the king,
he will never love me the way he loved his first wife.
I'm trapped by the memory of the life they used to share.
I know about being trapped,
more than anyone.
Maybe this will lift your spirits.
So you...
can see yourself
the way I see you.
And how do you see me?
As the fairest in all the land.
记录大厅
When did that transfer go through?
Does three weeks ago sound right?
Yeah. Why?
Because those records are missing.
Emma, there's something I'd like to talk to--
Hi, Sidney.
Hey. We're just doing some work.
I think we may have found something on Regina.
Interesting work.
Oh, I approve.
You wanna go by the book? Let's get a warrant.
What judge are we gonna find that she doesn't own?
We're screwed.
Or... there's my way.
I want to do this right, Sidney.
And what's right is exposing her.
Sometimes doing a bad thing for a good reason is okay, right?
Yeah. I mean, maybe you're doing something wrong,
but if it's what's meant to be, if it's what's right,
does that really make you a bad person?
Exactly.
Wow. You two are doing a whole lot of rationalizing.
But look what she's done to you, to me,
to your son, and it's not gonna stop,
so whatever you do, you gotta do something.
Okay.
Let's start by talking to her.
And just what are you and the...
disgraced ex-reporter accusing me of?
$50,000 was transferred out of the city account by you.
Well, as Mayor, I'm involved in many transactions.
Check the public records if you have questions.
That's the thing. They're missing from three weeks ago.
You have any idea what happened to them?
Well, if they're missing, I probably checked them out,
as my job often requires me to do.
And if they were checked out three weeks ago,
well, that means they burned...
in a fire.
In a fire, that if I recall, got you elected sheriff.
I have nothing to hide.
Okay.
There's nothing for us to do. Let's go, Sidney.
Emma.
No, she's right. We have nothing.
That was your plan? I thought you were gonna do something.
I did. I planted a bug.
You win, Sidney. Let's do whatever it takes.
You called for me, your majesty?
I have reason to believe...
My wife's heart belongs to another man.
Well, certainly, the queen would never stray, your majesty.
And yet her diary suggests otherwise.
Last night, a man gave me a gift,
and though it was but a simple mirror,
it awakened feelings in me that I abandoned long ago.
Hope for love and companionship,
even though I am trapped in my husband's court.
Sadly, the diary does not name
the man who gave her this mirror.
I am not a fool.
I realize that the queen is unhappy
and yearns for someone to love her in a way that I never can.
And yet I never imagined that she would betray me like this.
Well, certainly,
the queen would never act on these feelings.
Love makes people do foolish things.
And why have you called upon me, your majesty?
I need someone with your wits
to learn the identity of the man who has stolen my wife's heart.
And what will you do to him once I have found him?
That is my concern, not yours.
Now...
tell me, Genie,
can you find the man who gave the queen this mirror
or not?
Ms. Ginger, I really don't have time
for more complaints about working conditions.
The air temperature is not one of my areas.
Scintillating.
Find anything good yet?
Yeah, better than good.
She made this call a little over an hour ago.
I'll meet you tonight at access road 23
with the rest of your payment.
Yes, it will all be in cash.
A-and I don't need to remind you
that no one can know about this.
Yes, I know it has to be tonight.
Who's on the other end?
You bugged the office, not the phone.
Well, we're just gonna have to find out.
Yeah.
A payoff in the woods. That's promising.
A payoff using stolen city funds.
Let's go find out who she's meeting.
Emma.
It won't stop.
Oh. You okay?
Yeah. You?
Yeah.
We're gonna miss that handoff.
Emma.
What?
You know that bug you planted?
I think Regina found it.
Someone's been tampering with the brakes.
She's on to us.
Wait!
The bitch tried to have me killed.
I'm finding her.
Let's be cautious. We need to think clearly.
To hell with caution. I'm gonna find out what she's doing
and why she's out here.
She was meeting me.
What are you doing out here with her?
Just a little business transaction.
What's in the briefcase?
Everything comes at a price.
Land is no different.
That's why you're meeting her out here?
Regina bought your land?
The very ground you're standing on.
What does she want it for?
You know, in business, I find it's best not to ask too many questions.
Hurts the bottom line.
The question is, Emma,
why are you standing out here in the middle of the night
with mr. Glass?
You don't know what Regina did to me.
You don't know what she did to her son.
We can't just sit idly by.
Of course you can.
Be careful.
Emotional entanglements can lead us down very dangerous paths.
I was beginning to worry you wouldn't come.
You were expecting the Queen?
Who are you?
What have you done with her?
The King has locked her away in her chambers.
My daughter is a prisoner in her own kingdom.
You... are the Queen's father?
Please, take this to her.
The palace guards won't allow me into her chambers.
They know I'd die for her.
But you...
the King trusts you.
He doesn't know that you have my daughter's heart.
The guards will allow you in.
Give her this box.
Wait. I don't understand. What is in it?
This is the only thing that can free her
from this wretched life.
If you truly care for my daughter,
I know you'll do whatever it takes
to set her free.
What are we doing here?
We know she bought land from Gold.
We don't know why.
I'm willing to bet it's for personal reasons.
But we have to know for sure. We need documents
that officially link her to that land.
So you want to break into her office? It's locked,
and she's got a state-of-the-art security system and alarm.
If we don't show this town who Regina really is, who will?
Do you think you can crack her code?
Yep.
Emma!
Who does the alarm system alert? The police.
I'm the police.
Two minutes for her to get a call from the alarm company.
One minute to get her coat and keys.
Three minutes to drive here.
We got maybe six minutes.
I just uncovered every file
that references the tract of land she bought from Gold.
Nice.
What the hell do these open?
I don't know.
What are you doing?
Looking for Henry's book.
We didn't come here for Henry.
We came here for the files and--
No, you didn't come here for Henry.
Me? That's the only reason I'm here.
What are you doing?
Some kids broke in. I heard the alarm,
so I'm checking it out 'cause... I'm sheriff.
Well, that was an awfully quick response time.
You told me to do my job.
I'm doing it.
And you brought him.
Oh, well, he saw it while he was on a walk, so he's a witness.
And what did you see, Sidney?
Some kids with a...
Rock.
A rock.
Did they take anything?
I don't know.
I'd have to do a thorough, sweep to, uh, find out.
It appears to me it's all just a prank.
You sure you don't want me to take the place apart?
Sheriff, your services are not wanted nor needed.
Okay. Well, you know where to find me.
It's you.
My love for you grows stronger with every beat of my heart.
But the King has read my diary,
found my mirror.
Soon he will discover the truth about us.
There is no escape.
There is always an escape.
Your father said what's in this box
would give you your freedom.
Yes, I believe it will.
The Agrabahn viper--
A snake so deadly it can kill anything.
With a single bite.
This serpent is from my homeland.
I know all too well of its poison.
But why would you have it brought here?
There is no happiness left for me in this life.
One small bite...
then I shall be free from this prison forever.
I'm sorry we couldn't be together, my love.
Perhaps in another life, we will find each other again.
There is another way.
What if the King...
didn't live?
You would do that for me?
For you, I would do anything.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
You will never have to find out.
What you working on?
Uh, no time to talk.
I gotta write it all down before I forget.
Yeah, I hate it when great ideas slip away from me.
They're not my ideas.
They're stories from a book that I lost.
Must be a hell of a book.
What's it about?
Stuff.
Sounds exciting.
You seem awfully interested in me and my book.
Oh. I'm just being neighborly.
What are you doing in Storybrooke?
I'm a writer.
You can write anywhere.
What are you really doing here?
Stuff.
Good luck with the stories.
Blueprints, bank statements.
What is she building out there?
A mansion?
Well, whatever it is, it doesn't matter,
because these escrow statements have her name all over it.
You were right. Personal use.
She's done. We got her.
What's wrong? Didn't you hear me?
We stooped to her level.
That's exactly what I promised Henry I wouldn't do.
Emma, we got her!
It's fruit of the poisonous tree,
illegally obtained evidence.
It'll get thrown out in court in a heartbeat.
No, we don't need her to go to jail.
Then what are we doing here?
What you wished for-- get everyone to see who she is.
What she did to Henry,
she does to everyone.
She destroys what people love.
Let me show you something.
She made me follow you.
She made me tell her everything.
She knew about your secret place weeks ago.
She just waited to destroy it
till it would hurt you and Henry the most.
It's all my fault.
If you don't do this,
I have to.
Okay.
This session of the Storybrooke city council will come to order.
We will begin by reading the minutes from our last meeting.
Excuse me, um, Madame Mayor.
I have something I'd like to bring to the council's attention.
This is not an open forum, Sidney.
And no one on this council's interested in hearing
the boozy complaints of a disgraced reporter.
Now sit down.
He's not the only one who has something to say.
Ms. Swan,
this meeting is to discuss issues facing Storybrooke.
Like the mayor stealing thousands of dollars
from the city to build herself a second home?
Ms. Swan, you will sit down immediately, or so help me--
What? You'll punish me?
You'll bully me like everyone else in this town?
No.
Not today.
In my hand, I am holding documents proving that
this woman, your mayor, stole funds from the city
to build herself a lavish home in the woods.
And this disgraced reporter--
You wanna know why he was really fired?
Because he stood up to her. Because he questioned her.
We all know what happens to people who question the Mayor.
You claim that you act in the best interest of all of us,
but that isn't the truth, is it?
The truth is you are a thug that doesn't care about anyone
or anything but yourself.
That is who you really are,
and it's time for the people of Storybrooke to know that.
You are right, Ms. Swan.
I am building a house.
A playhouse.
The accusations are true.
I did take city funds.
I wanted to build a playground so my son Henry
and all the children of Storybrooke
could have a special place to play...
safely.
As for the sketch in your hands,
it was inspired by a drawing I found
in one of my son's books.
So there you have it, Ms. Swan.
You've exposed me for who I really am.
I hope you're satisfied.
Forgive me.
The pain will soon pass.
You asked me to find the man who gave the mirror to your queen.
I did.
I am that man.
You gave me my freedom.
You gave me a chance to find love,
and for that, I'm forever in your debt,
but just as you freed me,
so must I now free your queen.
Forgive me.
You were right.
I never should have made a wish.
Look at her.
Queen of the castle.
You know, what you did in there was commendable, Ms. Swan,
but if you really want to bring her down,
you're gonna need a strong ally.
Like yourself?
Thanks,
but I'm still not interested.
Oh, one can wish.
Ms. Swan, a word?
Alone.
I don't know what you were hoping to accomplish in there,
but now I hope you'll go back to your job,
which is upholding the law,
not breaking it.
You don't think I know you broke into my office?
Don't pretend like you're so innocent.
I know you messed with the brakes on my car.
Your brakes?
Are you delusional?
Why would I kill you when you just saw I had nothing to hide?
Nothing I can prove.
Well, until you have something more substantial than disdain
to throw my way,
you're gonna stay away from me,
and more importantly, from Henry.
But that's--
Not open for discussion.
You've lost the high ground, sheriff.
If I wanted to, there's not a judge in the world
that would deny me a restraining order after what you've done.
You don't get to see my son unless I say so,
and right now?
I don't say so.
Why are you so far away?
Come out here.
Sorry, kid. I can't today.
You're undercover, aren't you, for Operation Cobra?
No, Henry, I'm not undercover.
Your mom--she doesn't want us seeing each other for a while.
You don't have to listen to her.
Actually, this time, I do.
I screwed up, Henry.
I got mad at your mom about you and the book
and everything and...
Well, we're just gonna have to be apart for a little while.
I don't want to be apart.
Neither do I, but right now we have to.
Don't worry. I'll find a way back in.
And hey, if it's out there, Henry,
I will find your book.
Good luck.
It's probably gone, and it's probably never coming back.
Looks like we had the same idea.
Well, if you can't beat her,
drink.
How did we not see this?
We did. We saw it all, right from the start.
Just didn't want to look.
Blinded by our anger,
by everything.
This time.
But there are a lot more skeletons in Regina's closet.
And the good news?
You got yourself an ally.
We won't get fooled again.
It is done.
You are free, my love.
We are free to be together at last.
D-did you not hear me?
Our days of imprisonment are over.
You haven't heard the news.
The palace guards found the snake.
They know it's from your country.
They know it was you who killed the King.
It's only a matter of time before they catch you.
You will be executed.
I'm sorry...
But we will never be together.
Come.
I've arranged for a boat to provide you safe passage
out of the kingdom.
You must leave at once.
The Agrabahn Viper.
Of all the snakes in all the world,
that is what you chose.
You wanted the murder to be traced back to me.
You...
You fooled me.
You never loved me.
Loved you?
I wanted the King killed, and you killed him.
You are no longer of any use to me.
Be grateful I'm offering you an escape.
Now flee the kingdom and never turn back.
I can't live without you.
I won't live without you.
Did you not understand me?
I don't love you.
There is no way we will ever be together.
There is one way.
There is still one wish remaining.
I wish...
to be with you forever,
to look upon your face always,
to never leave your side.
No!
No!
No!
It looks like you got your wish.
You will be with me...
forever.
Have a seat, Sidney
You've got yourself an ally.
We won't get fooled again.
She bought it.
All of it.
Masterful job, Sidney,
top to bottom.
And cutting the brakes on her car?
Inspired.
I'm glad you approve.
Now she trusts you.
Now we can have some fun.
Everything she does,
everywhere she goes--
you'll know about it.
I don't know what I'd do without you, Sidney.
