The cure to vampirism.
You're gonna take the cure, Elena.
And I'm gonna take it with you.
It's not healing.
It worked.
The smallest chance at the perfect life with you
is infinitely better than an immortal one without you.
I made a list of all the things that
I've done since I fell for you.
Because you're a control freak who's lost control.
That's what falling for somebody is.
Control is all I have,
and I don't think that I can give that up.
Bonnie!
Before the 1900s, Lily fell in
with a group of witches that were cast out
of the Gemini Coven.
Vampires with witch power.
They can never be allowed to escape.
It's time we get the hell out of this place.
Welcome to the wedding of Alaric Saltzman
and Josette Laughlin.
Oh, god.
No.
Miss me?
What are you doing?
Waiting for you.
On the ground where we first met?
I'm feeling symbolic.
It's bad, isn't it?
I believe you owe me a dance, miss Gilbert.
Damon, just tell me.
How bad is it?
Dance with me, please, Elena.
Elena!
Come on. Hey. Wake up.
Elena.
Oh, God.
Help.
Somebody, please help me.
Kai!
Come on. Just drink.
No. No.
Stefan. Stefan!
She won't wake up.
Oh, my God.
She won't wake up. I don't understand.
Just get her to the hospital now.
Yeah.
She's human. What if she doesn't--
Nothing personal, but this is a family matter now.
Let me guess. Prison world?
I mean, you can't kill me,
or else you all die, too, right?
I'm sorry about your twinsies.
I just don't feel like competing for leadership
with future Gemini twins.
See...
When your family decides
that you're nothing but an irredeemable piece of trash,
well...
guess the best thing to do is prove them right, right?
This ought to do it.
No!
You're going easy on me.
Come on.
This is supposed to be a special moment.
Yeah. No. I can't do this.
Don't do that.
Don't give up like that.
Why not?
I have nothing left to fight for.
Damon!
Bonnie Bennett.
You have no idea how good it is to hear your voice right now.
Damon, Kai's out.
I know. I'm glad you're safe.
I was worried Kai already got to you.
He did, and I don't know how, but I'm still alive.
He drained my blood, and that's all.
That's not all.
He was at the wedding.
Jo's dead. He killed her.
Oh, my God.
And Elena got knocked out, and she's not waking up.
The doctors keep telling me
there's nothing physically wrong with her.
I don't know what to do, Bon.
Stay there, ok? I'm coming.
Good. You're up.
Sorry to be indecorous,
but you were both solidly unconscious
when I pulled you from the wedding mayhem.
Where are we going? Elena!
Elena is in the hospital with Damon.
Kai is dead,
and all the Geminis are going down with him,
and I grabbed the two of you to help me deal with a bigger problem.
There's a bigger problem?!
Valerie, Malcolm?
Get in the car, please.
1702 route 12.
That's--that's where we are, right?
I mean, I read the map very carefully.
He--he said they would be here.
They're probably scared out of their minds.
Who are you talking about?
My friends.
Kai brought them back when he escaped that prison.
They're here somewhere.
He lied to you. There's nobody out he.
You made a deal with a sociopath,
and now a lot of people are dead.
You're wasting your time!
Where's my daughter?
Liv!
Liv!
Oh, Tyler!
Oh, god, no.
This can't be happening.
Oh, God.
What's happening to me?
Kai's dead, Liv.
I heard the screams.
Your dad, your coven, they're all in there,
dying, which means--
No. No. No.
I love you, Liv.
You need to know that
if this has to be it for us.
No. You're not dying,
Liv.
not after everything.
You're not dying, Tyler.
It's a full moon.
If you turn, it will heal you.
You have to.
No. I'm not triggering it.
You once told me
that I gave you a second chance,
and you promised me that you wouldn't waste it.
I love you.
Let me do this for you.
Don't waste it.
I love you.
Nooo!
Come on. Answer.
Answer damn it.
Ty?
Matt, listen to me.
You have to tell every...
Ty, what's wrong?
I triggered my curse.
No.
Tell every vampire to steer clear of me.
I don't know if I'll be able to control who I go after,
and my bite will kill them.
Let me guess-- not there either.
Did you come all this way to mock me?
No. I came here to put you back in your cell where you belong.
Do I look like a ripper, Stefan?
I've said repeatedly that the hope of being reunited with my family
is enough to overcome the urges.
Would you please just stop it with the word family?
They're just a bunch of random people that you happened to sire.
We spent a century and a half together.
We're loyal to each other.
Our relationship is a deeper bond than I have ever known.
What other word would I use?
Lily, you either come with me right now,
or you're out of my life.
Do you understand me?
Your son.
I'm sorry.
Malcolm, are you here, sweetheart?
What did you give Kai?
I thought you were leaving.
Tell me what you gave Kai in return for your family.
I gave him my blood.
Vodux.
Here's to being different, dad.
Bad time?
Freaky, right?
I turned myself into one of Lily's heretics.
It's really incredible actually.
I can literally siphon the magic of my vampirism
and convert it into more magic.
Looks like somebody's having a very bad day.
Motus!
Bad doggie.
Here. Say it.
No. I'm not doing this.
Fine. I'll say it.
Here lies Elena Gilbert,
a fun girlfriend and an amazing friend.
I'm glad one of us can find humor in this.
I have to find humor in this, Matt,
because the alternative...
The alternative would be to say good-bye,
and I'm just--
I'm not ready for that yet.
Bonnie, let's go. We got to get to the hospital.
What's wrong?
What is that?
I found it in the kitchen.
All this time travel's been hard on the camera, Bon.
There it is.
You saw the post-it!
This message will self-destruct In 10 seconds.
Kidding. Anyhoo, you're probably wondering why you're still alive
since I should have bled you out
one painful ounce at a time.
I mean, that's what you deserved.
You left me behind in 1903,
which I did not appreciate,
But I guess you forgot about that old Canadian rock
filled with Bennett blood.
Anyway, even though I got out,
now I kind of just want to make you suffer
in new--and if I may say so myself--
totally inspired ways.
What is this?
Keep watching.
What's happening to me?
You didn't happen to pet a fuzzy,
4-legged, vampire-killing machine, did you?
How do I fix it?
Easy. There's a cure in New Orleans.
I'll go get it for you.
Just tell me what you did to Elena.
Oh, I can't do that.
One thing you're not gonna do--
You're not gonna mess with me.
I am in a very volatile place right now,
and I will start beheading people that I don't like,
starting with you,
if she doesn't wake up.
So what did you do to my damn girlfriend?
It's just not as threatening
when I'm seeing, like, 4 superblurry versions of you.
Fix her! I know it's a spell!
She's in perfect health.
And she'll stay that way until she wakes.
Young, beautiful human Elena Gilbert,
preserved in this moment indefinitely.
So, Bonster,
I linked Elena's life to yours.
The rule is as long as you're alive,
Elena will remain asleep.
Oh, my God.
Please tell me you didn't.
Oh, I totally did.
Oh, and--oh, and please don't go looking
for some weird witchy work-around
because, as the incredibly powerful leader of the Geminis,
I rigged this so that if you do try to outsmart it
both you and Elena will die instantly.
I guess what I'm trying to say is
your betrayal really hurt me, Bon,
so this is kind of all your fault.
You have to get out town now, Bon.
I'm not letting Kai win.
Bonnie, Elena's the only thing that Damon Salvatore cares about.
He'll kill you.
You have to get out of here now.
Damon, think about it.
Every day that you wake up without Elena in your arms,
you'll have the burning desire to kill Bonnie.
Of course, you could just get it over with and kill her now,
but Elena will probably never speak to you again.
Hang on. Hang on. I just...
I just need two seconds.
Well, you are the one who chose a 5-mile hike
to say good-bye to me.
This isn't good-bye, Stefan.
Besides, this hike
is where I told you I didn't want to be a vampire.
I thought it would be fitting considering.
Because you're a weak human again?
You knew that I never wanted to be a vampire,
even before we took our first steps up that mountain.
You just wanted to hear me say it out loud.
Well, a lot of good that did.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that
you knew me better than anyone.
You always have,
which is why you already know how impossible it is for me to--
to find the words to say good-bye.
Don't.
I can't do this, not--not now, not ever.
Where's Damon?
Bonnie tracked Kai.
He went to go beat the sleeping spell out of him.
Stefan, this whole thing with Elena,
if they can't break the spell,
are you gonna be ok?
Are you?
Of course not,
but when she wakes up, she'll still be my best friend.
After Bonnie's lived a long and happy life.
But you--you were soul mates,
and I want to make sure that you're ok.
I don't think Elena necessarily
came into my life to be my soul mate.
I mean, she was.
We loved each other,
but she was also the only person I've ever met
who actually believed that my brother was worth loving,
and she reminded me that I used to
believe that about him, too,
and her faith in him,
it brought Damon and me back together,
and, yeah, I--I loved her
more than I ever thought I could love somebody else,
but I think in the end
I needed him more than I needed her.
Is that why...
you feel you need to stay away from me?
Is it because you think that I haven't moved on?
S--no. Stefan, I--
I'm sure it sounds like I'm making a million excuses,
but you and I--
I can't do this right now.
I'm sorry.
Hello!
Anyone still alive, hmm?
Anyone alive, just raise your hand.
I need blood.
You need more than blood.
Maybe some ointment.
'Cause gross.
Do your friends think you're funny?
Because maybe if you were funny,
if you were the one with the good jokes,
who they could always count on to make them laugh,
maybe they'd be cool with letting you live instead of Elena.
You are right. So the sick humor's your thing.
I'm just the one that does magic.
Undo the spell, Kai!
I can't.
What's done is done.
Ossox.
Again!
I can't undo the spell, Bonnie.
My death made it permanent.
Fine. I'll just wait for the werewolf bite to kill you.
You know what's funny?
I didn't even know werewolves were real
until I got bit by one.
The thing is, Bon,
the only way a guy turns into a wolf
is if it's magic, right,
so technically, their venom's magic, too.
So I just went ahead and siphoned it up.
No, no.
Motus.
Just dance with me.
This was supposed to be our big night.
Tell me, Damon.
I can see it all over your face.
How bad is it?
Kai linked you to Bonnie.
You won't wake up until she dies.
What?!
He won, Elena.
What are you gonna do?
Damon.
Damon?
Bonnie.
Bonnie.
Damon.
How dumb are you?
I deliver you a dying Bonnie Bennett on a silver platter, and--whoosh--
right over your head.
Damon.
You're ok.
Damon.
Uh, translation-- she's about to croak.
Damon.
Of course, you don't have to help her.
You could just walk away.
She dies of a collapsed lung,
no blood on your hands,
and you and Elena get to live the life you always dreamed of.
Either way, you better act quick.
I'm so sorry, Bonnie.
That's it? He just left you?
The whole point was that this would torture him for a while.
I mean, you'd think he'd at least flip a coin--
heads, he picks you, tails, he picks--
Heads it is.
You think I was gonna leave you all alone, huh?
No way.
I'm not out of nicknames for you yet.
Ok. Let's do this.
You two are up first.
It's easy, Bon.
We just take her hand...
Close your eyes...
And let her into your thoughts.
Are we seriously having a sleepover?
Come on! Hurry up and get in here.
I'm the one who gets to see her again.
I mean, you should get the better good-bye.
Oh, Care. Come here.
Take care of everyone while I'm gone, ok?
I will.
I promise.
Promise me something, both of you.
Write it all down,
everything that you accomplish in your lives, every crush,
when you fall in love, when you start a family,
every time you fantasize about wanting to kill Damon.
Write it down
so that one day when I wake up
I can read all about my best friends' lives
and feel like I was there.
I'm so sorry, Elena.
Really, I'm so sorry.
This isn't your fault.
We'll both get everything that we want.
We just can't have it at the same time.
Bonnie Bennett,
you have spent your entire life making sacrifices for me.
Now it's my turn to do it for you.
I just have one more favor to ask.
Ok.
Ok.
Can you do it one last time?
There. I did it. Are you happy?
Very.
Now it's your turn to be.
So I'm a cop, huh?
That's my hope for you, Matt.
In our crazy lives together,
you've always stayed the same--
human, loyal,
and good.
My hope is that you spend the rest of your life
fighting for people like you.
You know, there's a good chance that I'll never see you again.
Matt.
Look at everything that the two of us have survived.
I like our odds.
You're gonna think that the pain will never end,
but it will,
but first, you have to let it all in.
You can't fight it.
It's bigger than you.
You have to let yourself drown in it,
but then eventually, you'll start to swim,
and every single breath that you fight for will make you stronger.
And I promise that you will beat it.
Alaric.
Jeremy.
I--I tried to be here sooner.
I wanted to be here for the wedding.
I'm glad you weren't.
You made it!
3 canceled flights.
I could have walked here faster.
Oh, and I was doing so well.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to at least pretend to be strong for you.
When you do wake up,
I want you to know that I spent my life
doing exactly what I felt I was born to do.
I was happy.
So where are we in this vision of yours?
Not here. Not in Mystic Falls.
You need to get out of here, Tyler.
You need to figure out what it is you want to do,
who you want to be,
and then just really fight for it.
You're gonna be fine, Tyler.
You're a wolf now. Embrace it. Don't fight it.
Let it be the thing that makes you extraordinary.
Thank you for bumping into me that day in the hallway.
I thought I would never be happy again,
and then--and then I met you.
You changed everything for me.
You--you quite literally saved my life.
I love you so much,
which is why I can't wait to find out
what new life you--you've chosen for yourself
in 60 or 70 years when I see you again.
I can guarantee it won't be high school.
Just be happy.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you, Elena.
Lorenzo.
You came back.
You must think me such a monster.
We're all monsters in some way, I suppose.
My life before my friends was misery.
Even as a mother, a--a wife,
I never felt whole,
but then I found these people,
and, uh, I felt a part of something.
Can you understand that just a little?
I can
because I've been searching for that my whole life.
What is it?
That building.
It wasn't there last night.
Kai must have had this cloaked.
When he died--
It can't be!
Lorenzo...
It's our family.
You think she'll be safe here?
If word gets out that her body has the cure inside,
every vampire who wants to be a human
will come busting in through that door.
Bonnie will spell it shut.
We're under strict orders not to open it for anyone.
I guess that means that--
That means it's time for me to say good-bye.
You could have just told me what to do.
I knew what you were going to do.
You knew that the evil, selfish Damon Salvatore
would give up the love of his life
to save her best friend?
I knew that the love of my life
would stand by his best friend
even if it meant having to live without me for a little while.
Things are gonna be awfully dull around here without you.
No, they're not, Damon,
because you're not gonna sit around waiting for me.
I was thinking of doing the starvation diet
because desiccation makes the time go faster.
Damon, this isn't gonna work if you just shut down.
I need you to live your life,
enjoy yourself.
I want you to be happy.
Now how about that dance?
Yesterday, you told me you made a list
of all the ways that loving me has ruined your life,
and I get it.
I haven't made it easy on you...
But I made a list, too,
of all the ways that loving you has changed mine.
You were by my side when I needed a friend.
You made me laugh,
you made me dance.
You told me that I would find love again...
And I understand if you need time to heal
and to live your life without me,
and I understand if I have to wait for you,
and I will.
I'll wait,
and when you're ready for me,
I will be ready for you.
Are you ready for this?
Ready to spend the next 60 years of my life without you in it?
Who's ever gonna be ready for that?
I love you, Damon Salvatore.
I love you, too.
