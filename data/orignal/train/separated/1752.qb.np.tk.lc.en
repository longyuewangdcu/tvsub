i like your suit .
oh , thanks . got a couple new outfits for work .
how does it feel knowing your fiancée &apos;s job
is to go out and flirt with doctors ,
looking like that ,
while you sit here , you know ...
looking like this ?
she doesn &apos;t flirt with doctors .
yeah . it &apos;s all very professional .
you know when you bend over , i can see down your shirt ?
okay , good .
speaking of new careers ,
how are things going with dark matter , sheldon ?
oh , yeah , i &apos;d have to say it &apos;s the most exiting time
in the history of the field .
what &apos;s going on ?
i started doing it .
you know , the government funded
the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter .
oh , yeah , i &apos;ve read about that--
they &apos;re sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines .
we could be on the ground floor of something big--
not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well .
wait , hang on-- you guys are gonna work in a mine ?
why not ?
you had a panic attack when we went through the car wash .
perhaps the emotion you &apos;re referring to was shock
at you having something cleaned .
i think what penny meant is ,
the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny--
it &apos;s like a cat riding a roomba .
if they get scared , they &apos;ll have those hats
with the lights on them , &apos; cause down there
it &apos;s night @-@ night all the time !
maybe they could ride around
in one of those mine carts that go ,
ee @-@ oo @-@ ee @-@ oo @-@ ee @-@ oo .
yeah , it &apos;ll help them get away when they see a gh @-@ gh @-@ ghost ... !
are they making fun of us ?
yup .
i miss the old days when i couldn &apos;t tell .
so , one of my favorite video games of all time
is called shadow of the colossus ,
and it was only for playstation 2,
but then they came out with a new version
for ps3 with better graphics .
i finally got the chance to play it ,
and for some reason , it just wasn &apos;t as good as the first one .
or something about yoga .
i &apos;m sorry-- i was thinking about work .
well , i was just saying that there was this video game ...
yeah , that &apos;s when i started thinking about work .
uh , listen , i &apos;ve got some good news .
this is for you .
what is this ?
well , you know how they gave me the company car ?
didn &apos;t make sense to have two , so i sold the other one .
the one i gave you ?
yeah . and there &apos;s your money back--
and now we &apos;re even .
how great is that ?
uh , yeah .
what ?
nothing .
oh , come on , leonard ,
i know the car was a thoughtful gesture
and i really appreciate it ,
but it doesn &apos;t make sense to have both .
you &apos;re right .
what should i have done ?
taken a picture of us in the car
and put it in a pink frame
with puffy paint around it that says &quot; best fiance ever &quot; ?
doesn &apos;t sound that bad .
well , good , because ... that &apos;s why i did !
thank you . that @-@ that is so sweet .
no , it &apos;s not that sweet--
i paid for the frame with your money
and then got a massage .
you know what , you don &apos;t have to give me this .
you keep it .
why ?
the car was a gift--
it was something you needed .
i was happy to help you out .
and i really appreciate it , but now i don &apos;t need it ,
so ... here you go .
well , this is silly-- so you don &apos;t need the car ,
but you could use it to buy yourself something else ,
like a ... new purse to put all this money in .
sweetie , i can buy my own stuff .
i have a good job now .
i know , and i &apos;m proud of you ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t do something nice .
like this .
okay , i don &apos;t want this to turn into a fight .
i don &apos;t , either .
great .
thank you .
can you pass the salt , please ?
sure .
in my mind , that broke the tension with comedy
and led to sex .
hey , sheldon , you busy ?
i &apos;m always busy .
this mind is capable of advanced multitasking .
you know , currently , i &apos;m attempting to solve
the penrose conjecture ,
i &apos;m composing my nobel acceptance speech
for when i &apos;ve solved the penrose conjecture ,
and i &apos;m wondering how mermaids have babies .
don &apos;t they lay eggs on a rock ?
now i &apos;ve got room for another thing .
what do you want ?
so , i did a little research on what
the conditions are like in the mines ,
and the guys might be right--
sounds pretty rough down there .
for starters , it &apos;s very humid ,
and about a hundred degrees .
well , i &apos;m from texas and you &apos;re from india--
we &apos;re no strangers to the fragrant armpit . next .
it &apos;s also a live mine ,
so there &apos;ll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance .
yeah , i have a lactose @-@ intolerant roommate
with a taste for ice cream . next .
oh , you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time .
yeah ? we have to be somewhere .
well , there &apos;s no toilets--
we &apos;ll have to do our business in a bucket .
so it &apos;s settled-- we &apos;re not doing it .
look , i get it , but ...
before we pass up on an incredible opportunity ,
i was thinking about when howard was training to go to space ,
they put him in a simulated environment .
interesting .
you &apos;re suggesting that we recreate
the conditions of the mine
to see if we can handle it .
exactly .
very well .
so where should we do it ?
well , i &apos;ll just google &quot; hot , dark and moist , &quot;
see what comes up .
uh , sheldon ...
oh , there , well , look , there &apos;s all kinds of videos .
hey , you got a sec ?
hi . sure .
i was hoping we could talk about the money again .
oh , sweetie , just forget about it .
no , no , no , no ,
hear me out . i know things got a little weird last night .
well , leaving an envelope full of cash
on my dresser after sex
would count as weird .
well , i think i came up with a pretty good solution .
why don &apos;t we just put the money in a joint account ?
it &apos;ll be our first money together .
we can use it for the wedding , the honeymoon , whatever .
you know what , that &apos;s great . i love that !
yeah , of course you do--
i &apos;m not just a genius in bed .
you sure are , baby .
you two want to be alone ?
i want you to know i get why you don &apos;t want the money--
you &apos;ve got this new job , you &apos;re excited
about being financially independent--
and i am nothing but proud of you .
oh , thank you so much .
it feels so good to hear you say that .
and i want you to know
that i get this job kind of changes
the balance in our relationship ,
and ... i &apos;m trying to be sensitive to that .
what ?
well , i just think that maybe you &apos;re a little hung up
on the money because i &apos;m less reliant on you now ,
and that &apos;s a little scary .
maybe .
or maybe i tried to do something nice
and maybe you had a problem with it
because of your control issues .
control issues ?
maybe .
or ... maybe ...
now that i &apos;m no longer an out @-@ of @-@ work actress
who can &apos;t pay for her own dinner ,
that makes you a little insecure .
well , i can &apos;t believe you &apos;d say that .
you know how insecure i am about my insecurities .
you know what ? i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s stupid to fight over money .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry , too .
we &apos;re about to share the rest of our lives together .
it &apos;s our money-- who cares who has it ?
ugh ! you &apos;re right-- who cares ?
get that money out of my back pocket
or i will break your fingers .
all this time i never knew
there were steam tunnels down here .
most universities have them .
when i was an undergrad , i spent three days in one
pledging a sorority .
did you get in ?
no . they forgot i was there .
but it really opened up my pores .
well , according to my research ,
the steam tunnels below this access point
should be the closest analog to the mines .
this is gonna be so much more accurate
than the steam room at the gym .
plus , there &apos;s almost no chance
we &apos;ll see any of our coworkers half naked .
or totally naked .
i love howard ,
but the dude needs a little shame .
all right , amy , this walkie @-@ talkie is yours .
if we run into any problems , i &apos;ll contact you .
and if anything bad happens , what &apos;s the rule ?
save you first ; come back for raj only if there &apos;s time .
we &apos;re going to be fine .
sheldon , i &apos;m really impressed
you &apos;re willing to try this .
well , admittedly , this brushes up against my well @-@ known aversions
to heat , small places ,
going below floor @-@ level ,
dampness , hatches , ladders ,
darkness , echoes ,
and eliminating in home depot buckets .
that last one is quite new , but i have a feeling
that &apos;s gonna rocket to the top of the list .
i &apos;m sweating already .
yeah , as the person beneath you , allow me to say , i know .
how hot is it ?
uh , let &apos;s see . 704 ?
no , wait , it &apos;s on &quot; clock . &quot;
no , the real answer isn &apos;t much better .
102 degrees .
well , that &apos;s what we wanted .
this is as hot as the mines will be .
true .
sheldon &apos;s mine simulation log , entry one .
koothrappali &apos;s restating of the obvious
is already getting on my nerves .
thanks again for having us .
oh , of course . what did you guys want to talk about ?
well , you know , now that we &apos;re engaged ,
we had some questions about
how you handle money as a couple .
i told you they weren &apos;t gonna ask us to swing with them .
i didn &apos;t think they were going to .
i just wanted to have a way to say no
without hurting leonard &apos;s feelings .
well ... nailed it .
so what did you want to know ?
well , do you guys ever fight over money ?
sure , sometimes .
i mean , it can be a little awkward
since i make so much more money than howie .
you didn &apos;t have to say &quot; so much more . &quot;
well , i didn &apos;t have to , but for the sake of accuracy
i felt that i should .
i brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship , too .
like what ?
your incomplete set of star trek collector plates ?
for your information , i just bought the last one
i needed on ebay .
without asking me ?
there were only three minutes left in the auction
and it was a mint condition scotty
from a smoke @-@ free home .
how much , howie ?
not a lot .
how much ?
let &apos;s not talk about this in front of our friends .
was it more or less than falconry school ?
for the tenth time , that was a groupon .
like i would swing with him .
how you feeling ?
good .
little claustrophobic .
let &apos;s set up the equipment .
it &apos;ll help take your mind off of it .
miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up .
do you know any mining songs ?
just the hits .
* where it &apos;s dark as a dungeon *
* and it &apos;s damp as the dew *
that &apos;s pretty .
* where the dangers are double *
* and the pleasures are few *
* where the rain never falls *
* and the sun never shines *
* yes , it &apos;s dark as a dungeon *
* way down in the mine *
it &apos;s a little more bleak than i thought .
* well , i pray when i dead *
* and the ages shall roll *
* that my body will blacken *
* and turn into coal *
getting kind of grim .
* then i &apos;ll look from the door *
* of my heavenly home *
* and pity the miner *
* that mines my poor bones . *
okay . how &apos; bout a little miley cyrus next ?
现在则是走疯狂怪诞女歌手路线
who &apos;s he ?
talk about wasted money .
what about the late fees on our credit card
because somebody didn &apos;t pay the bill on time ?
well , maybe i would have paid it
if i wasn &apos;t also doing everything else around here .
oh , you &apos;re saying i don &apos;t do anything around here .
look at my chore chart .
she made him a chore chart .
i see it .
&quot; do the dishes . &quot; there &apos;s a star right there .
that was a pity star . putting water in the roasting pan
and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes .
that pan had to soak and you know it .
well , don &apos;t come crying to me
when you don &apos;t get your allowance .
it &apos;s not an allowance .
it &apos;s a stipend !
and we said we weren &apos;t gonna call it an allowance
in front of my friends .
i usually don &apos;t like lemon bars ,
but th @-@ these are really good .
so , as hannah montana ,
miley was a world @-@ famous pop star .
but then she would take off her wig and go to school
like a normal girl .
which , i don &apos;t have to tell you ,
at that age , is its own headache .
that &apos;s preposterous .
how would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig ?
but you &apos;re okay with superman concealing his identity
with a pair of glasses ?
he doesn &apos;t just put on a pair of glasses .
he combs back his curlicue
and affects a mild @-@ mannered personality .
you guys doing okay down there ?
i told you to use the walkie @-@ talkie !
you guys doing okay down there ?
please keep this channel clear for emergencies .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to the vending machine . do you want anything ?
this is a simulation .
we have to survive on the supplies we brought .
okay , just checking .
we should have asked her to get some funyuns .
you &apos;re not going to have funyuns
when we &apos;re a mile below the surface of the earth .
what if we brought them down with us ?
we &apos;ll take some funyuns .
anything else ?
some york peppermint patties ,
a couple of dr. peppers , and ...
run to best buy and see if they have a portable dvd player
and season one of a show called hannah montana .
have her get season two .
season one , it was still finding itself .
sorry you guys had to see that .
oh , don &apos;t apologize .
yeah .
it just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened .
money &apos;s a sensitive subject for howie
because of the difference in our income .
it really bothers him ?
well , sure . there &apos;s still a lot of pressure
on guys to be providers .
so even though he &apos;s happy for me ,
it &apos;s just a little tough on him .
uh @-@ oh .
what ?
well , if i do well in sales ,
i could end up making a lot more money than you .
not a problem . i grew up with a mother
who emasculated my father financially
and in every other aspect of his life , so ...
... really , it &apos;s what i think love looks like .
i &apos;ll be right back . i &apos;m gonna go check on him .
maybe it &apos;s a good thing we came here .
it &apos;s like a lesson in what not to do .
yeah .
i don &apos;t want something dumb like money to come between us .
it won &apos;t . let &apos;s just promise to figure this kind of stuff out
before we get married .
why are you being so bossy ? !
why are you being a baby ?
i &apos;m not a baby ! i &apos;m a grown man ,
and i made the bed . now where &apos;s my star ?
should we go ?
hang on .
i want to see if he gets the star .
oh , this heat is brutal .
as someone from the tropical subcontinent of india ,
you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment
only raises your body temperature .
that does explain why the servants used to look so hot
while they were fanning me .
let &apos;s get our minds off how uncomfortable we are .
we could take some more simulated instrument readings .
my major focus at the moment
is keeping my claustrophobia at bay .
how &apos;s that going ?
you tell me .
i feel like i can &apos;t breathe ,
and i am tempted to crack you open
and suck the air right out of your lungs .
sheldon , if this is too much , we can stop .
we &apos;re not stopping .
you don &apos;t have to bite my head off .
i apologize .
i j ...
i &apos;m plagued by an internal struggle .
if you would just use the bucket ,
you &apos;d be so much more comfortable .
my struggle is emotional .
is it amy ?
it &apos;s dark matter .
when i entered the field of string theory , i was a prodigy .
i rose to a position of respect ,
and i assumed my career would continue
on that upward trajectory .
now here i am in my 30s ,
i &apos;m back at square one .
and , frankly , it &apos;s frightening .
sheldon , you know what i think of when i &apos;m scared ?
voyager .
voyager the space probe
or voyager the star trek tv show ?
the space probe .
good . because i am too hot and tired
to go on about how much i hate voyager the tv show .
by the time i was born ,
voyager 1 &apos;s mission was supposed to be over .
it had seen jupiter
and saturn and all their moons ,
but it kept going .
when i left india for america ,
i was never more scared in my life .
i had no idea what lay ahead .
whenever i feel that way , i think about how ...
voyager is still out there
somewhere beyond our solar system ,
going further than anyone ever thought it could .
don &apos;t leave ! you can do this !
sheldon , is everything okay ?
it &apos;s too late for koothrappali .
let &apos;s go !
11 minutes . that &apos;s longer than i thought .
they &apos;re in my shirt !
they &apos;re in my shirt ! they &apos;re in my shirt !
okay , this is definitely the most fun thing
we can do with the money .
i &apos;ve never done it on a big old pile of cash before .
&quot; me neither , leonard . it &apos;s my first time , too . &quot;
i &apos;m so sorry i made you feel bad about the money stuff .
it &apos;s okay .
no , it &apos;s not okay .
i want us to be partners , equals .
adults in a mature relationship .
i want that , too .
now , let &apos;s talk about your birthday party .
ooh , laser tag , laser tag . oh !
do you really need me to transcribe this ?
you &apos;re not doing it for me .
you &apos;re doing it for future generations
who will benefit from my struggle .
sheldon &apos;s mine simulation log ,
entry four :
my kit kat has melted .
all is lost .
you call yourself a friend ? !
i was trying to help you !
and at the first sign of trouble
you ran away , leaving me to fend off a family of rats !
you &apos;re a completely selfish human being
and a ... and a physical and a moral coward !
his statements of the obvious continue to annoy .
