For over a century, I have lived in secret,
Until now. I know the risk,
and I have to know her.
Elena, she's a dead ringer for Katherine.
Where is he?
They have him. I can't get in.
Pearl says we're not here for revenge, right?
That's exactly what we're here for.
Can you make it?
Take my wrist. You need more blood.
Stefan, he's dead.
You were like this other person.
Everything's gonna be OK.
They found Vicki Donovan.
A storm unearthed the grave off county road.
She's dead?
Matt.
Could you turn it up a little bit?
It's not annoying yet.
Sorry.
When you goin' back to school?
Soon.
Oh, come on. Just drink already.
Come on.
This self-detox is unnatural.
Could you get that away from me, please?
How long did it take you to wean yourself off of it
after you last indulged?
That's not good.
Be fine. It just takes a little bit of time.
I don't get it. You know,
You don't have to kill to survive.
That's what blood banks are for.
I haven't hunted a human in...
Gahh... way too long.
Oh, I'm impressed.
It was completely self-serving.
Trying to get the town off the trail of vampires,
which is not very easy,
considering there's an entire tomb of them running around.
What are we planning on doing about that?
We're not gonna be doing much of anything
if you don't have your strength.
There's nothing wrong with partaking
in a healty diet of human blood from a blood bank.
You're not actually killing anyone.
I have my reasons.
Well, what are those holier-than-thou reasons?
You know, we've never actually discussed that.
You know, I-I'd love to hear this story.
You're really enjoying this, aren't you,
just watching me in a struggle?
Very much so.
I hate to break it to you, Damon,
But...ahem...I actually have it under complete control.
You do?
Oh. Well, then you should just carry on
making the rest of us vampires look bad.
Have a great day, Stef.
Oh. Hey, I almost forgot something.
Come on , Jeremy. Going to school.
Walking out the door now.
You forgot this.
Thank you.
Elena.
Uncle John. Hi.
Jenna.
John. You made it.
Said I'd be in by noon.
Oh, what you say and what you do
Are typically two very different things.
Uncle John. What's up?
I had some business in town.
I thought a visit was in order.
How long you staying?
I don't know yet.
Hmm. OK. Well, I'm gonna go to school. I'll see you later.
What's up with Jeremy?
He just lost a friend,
So try to be sensitive.
I'm always sensitive.
Right. So really, how long are you staying?
Can't you at least pretend that you're happy to see me?
Oh, my God, John.
It is so good to see you.
How have you been?
No, I can't.
Did you really think I was just gonna sign
the escrow papers and send 'em back?
Actually, I did.
I'm not gonna let you sell my brother's office.
It's not up to you or me.
It belongs to Jeremy and Elena.
They're minors, so I get the final say,
being that I'm the estate's trustee.
He said his trip is open-ended.
Uncle John. I never really liked that guy.
Heh. Does anyone?
I am here for moral support if you need me.
Thanks. I think I'll suffer this one alone.
You've been through enough.
Thank you, by the way, for just... for everything you did
At Vicki's funeral and her memorial.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Of course, Matt.
So is Caroline still baking for you guys around the clock?
She finally went to her dad's, which is a good thing
because my mom was gonna strangle her
if she dropped off more lasagna.
What's your problem?
I just don't want any.
All right.
They say she ODed.
That's what I don't get. She was doing OK.
Apparently not.
How'd she end up buried in the woods?
That's what I don't understand.
By whomever was with her when she ODed.
Yeah, but you leave her there.
You don't take the time to bury her.
Maybe she saw something and...
Hell, man, I don't know.
The coroner's office has officially ruled
Vicki Donovan's death a drug overdose.
Her family has been notified.
The truth will stay in this room,
and we can put this behind us.
Thank you, sheriff.
And on to a more pressing issue.
John Gilbert has asked to say a few words.
Welcome back, John. It's good to see you.
Thank you, mayor.
Hello, everyone. It's wonderful to see you.
I wish it were under better circumstances.
As a founding family member,
I find it's d duty to report some very distressing news.
He's a Gilbert?
Elena's uncle.
His name's John, but I call him jackass.
A hospital blood bank in the neighboring county of Amherst
has reported several breakins over the past two weeks.
7 hunters, 4 campers, and 2 state employees
have been reported missing as well,
All of this within a 75-mile radius of mystic falls.
OK. No need to get alarmed right at this moment.
Meaning he doesn't wanna cancel the founder's day kick-off party.
You think all of your problems are over,
but I'm here to tell you nothing's been solved.
I made a copy of a paper that Jeremy wrote for me.
I think you should take a look at it.
Jeremy wrote this?
He's very clear that he didn't think it was real.
I really hope you're right,
because I've done so much to protect him from all this.
So how do you deal with it?
What do you mean?
I don't know. With all the lies and the secrets.
You have to lie to everyone who's important to you.
It's not safe for them to know the truth,
So, yes, I keep it from them,
but it's only because I love them.
I think Stefan's a good guy,
But, uh...
at the end of the day, he's still a vampire.
I know it's hard to understand,
but Stefan's different.
He would never do anything to hurt me.
I have no interest in the founder's day kick-off party.
Sure, you do. It's tradition.
Far be it for us to break from tradition.
The Gilberts have been a part of this town for 150 years,
one of the founding families,
and with that distinction comes certain obligations,
including going to the party.
One day, when you can appreciate the significance,
I'll tell you all about your heritage.
Hmm. The Gilbert family legacy.
I forgot how sacred it was.
I'm not a Gilbert, so I was never cool enough to hear it.
Why does she hate you?
We used to sleep together.
I'm standing right here.
Why would he write a report on vampires?
Do you think he's starting to remember?
Damon toOK away those memories for good.
You don't have to worry about that.
Tell you what. Why don't you just ask him?
I...I can't.
Why not? I mean, if he doesn't know anything,
then it's just a...an innocent question.
I don't even know how to talk to him anymore.
I mean, we used to be a lot more open with each other,
But now, with all these secrets just piling up...
You know, I haven't even told him
that I'm adopted yet.
Maybe it's time you start opening up to him again.
I'm not saying you should tell him everything,
but at least try to find
out what he does know and be prepared for it.
What about you? How are you doing?
I'm much, much better.
Yeah, I'm...I'm still, you know, a little, uh...
a little jittery,
a little bit on edge, but, uh...
I'm...I'm gonna be OK.
I've been really worried about you,
and I missed you.
I just needed to lay low for a little while,
and, uh, let my body readjust.
It's only been a few days.
It feels like a lifetime.
I've missed you, too.
Stefan, what's wrong?
Stefan.
Oh, good. You're here.
You ask, I come.
I'm easy like that.
No, Elena, I will not...
go to your bedroom with you.
Just like I remembered.
Stop messing around.
You know, did you know
that your uncle's been kickin' it with the founder's council?
What?
Yep.
Perfect. We'll just add it to the growing list
of how everything's falling apart.
What happened right there?
Uh, nothing.
Look, Damon,
I...I'm worried about Stefan.
He says that everything's OK,
but he's clearly struggling.
How long is it gonna take before he's back to normal?
Few days, give or take.
It's been a few days.
Give then. I don't know.
What's the big deal?
He's not himself, Damon.
Well, maybe his problem is he's spent too long not being himself.
Please don't make me sorry for aking you.
It is what it is, Elena.
Hey.
The Stefan you know
was "Good behavior" Stefan, "Reign it in" Stefan,
"Fight against his nature
to an annoyingly obsessive level" Stefan,
but if you think there's not another part to this,
then you have not been paying attention.
He's not you, not even close.
Well, he doesn't wanna be me.
But that doesn't mean deep down that he's not.
What's up?
Do you have some time to talk?
Uh, yeah, sure.
Not here.
Come on. Let's get out of the house.
I just can't believe mom
and dad never told you that you were adopted.
I'm sure they would have eventually.
Why were you worried about what I thought?
Because...I don't know. It's weird...
going your whole life
thinking you're related by blood to someone.
Does it bug you that we're not?
No. Jer...
You're my brother. That's all that matters.
So Mr. Saltzman said you've been doing great in history now.
Yeah. Yeah, he's really been helpin' me out.
He gave me some extra credit and stuff.
He loved your vampire paper.
Yeah, he thought I had a clever angle.
What drew you to that subject matter?
Uh, I don't know. Um, boredom.
Or maybe I'm just as nuts as the long line of Gilbert crazies.
The Gilberts aren't crazy.
Ah, easy for you to say. You're not one.
Ouch.
Oh, God.
I shouldn't be here.
Come on. Don't be a downer.
It's a party for the Founding Families.
That would be us. It would be rude to skip it.
You know, I...I really liked you
a whole lot better when you hated everybody.
Oh, I still do.
I just love that they love me.
How you feelin'?
I'm good. I'm fine.
No cravings? No urges?
Has that whiskey you been drinkin' all day doin' its job?
We are who we are, Stefan.
Pretending doesn't change that.
Ah, nothing would make you happier
than to just see me give in, huh, Damon?
Whatever. It's inevitable.
I'm gonna go find Elena.
Don't embarrass me, young man.
I'm so glad you could join us tonight.
It was nice of you to reach out to us.
This town is one big family,
and when we lose a member,
we all have to come together.
Matt. Kel.
Well, I guess dead kid
rates a special greeting from the mayor, huh?
God, mom.
I need a drink.
Hey, check it out.
Dude, your dad's gonna beat you down if he catches you.
Yeah, let him try.
All right, screw it.
Hey. How are you?
Are you drunk?
OK, I know it's a little weird,
but it's really helping me.
The alcohol, it, uh...
takes the edge off.
You're totally that drunk high school guy
at the party sneaking booze.
I totally am. Yeah.
How worried do I need to be?
Oh, no. You don't need to be worried.
It's just until, um, the cravings go away.
Listen. I think we should enjoy it while it lasts.
Would you like to dance with me?
You hate dancing.
I usually have to beg you.
No, no, no. You have to beg the sober me.
The drunk me, there's no begging necessary.
There's really no one dancing.
That's because they need something better to dance to.
Be right back.
Yeah, that's not gonna work.
I already tried to bribe the guy with 20 bucks and a date.
He said Carol Lockwood
has complete control over the music choices.
You'd be surprised what Stefan can accomplish
when he puts his mind to it.
Thank God.
Have I entered an alternate universe where Stefan is fun?
Is he gonna be OK?
Eventually.
One way or another.
History teacher, 3 o'clock.
How do I look?
Beautiful.
Ah, I've been lookin' for you.
Here I am.
I haven't seen you in a while.
Yeah. Well, uh,
things have been a little crazy. Heh.
But I'm here now.
Do you wanna get a drink?
Sure.
OK. Great.
When did this happen?
Deejay had a change of heart.
Wanna dance?
I don't know.
Yes. Yes.
Matt. Matt.
Come on.
Ah, you know I love a woman in uniform,
but I have to side with this look.
You look...you look smashing.
Heh. Thank you, Damon.
Cheers.
I needed that.
You know, I had my doubts about you at first
but like everyone else on the council,
you've won me over.
Heh. Thanks, Liz.
It's... it's really nice how welcoming the council's been.
I like my life here in Mystic Falls.
Starting to feel like home again.
Well, then you're not gonna like what I have to tell you.
Jonathan Gilbert's claims check out.
The blood banks, the missing people, all of it's true.
We might have a problem.
Excuse me, sheriff.
Um, I was curious if there's been
any more information on what happened to Vicki Donovan.
It was an overdose, Jeremy.
Yeah, but her body was buried.
Somebody must have done that.
We're aware of that.
The investigation is ongoing,
but there's nothing more I can tell you at this time.
I'm sorry.
Uh, that's OK.
Please dance with your alcoholic vampire boyfriend.
Watch it.
I'm sorry. My fault. I'm clumsy.
Heh. Then get off the dance floor.
Excuse me?
That's no way to talk to a lady.
Whatever.
I think you need to apologize.
I'm sorry.
Now say it like you mean it.
I'm really, really sorry.
Stefan, it's fine.
Now walk away.
Are you all right?
Have you noticed what your brother's been up to?
Nope. Been too preoccupied with yours.
Jeremy's been asking questions
about Vicki Dodovavas death.
He knows that her death was ruled an overdose.
Really? "Oh, but, sheriff,
someone buried her.
Who would do that?"
I know. I know. Me.
I mean, I could compel him,
but he's wearing vervain.
No. I don't want you to compel him.
If he keeps asking questions...
Damon, no. I'm serious.
I'm not gonna do that to him again. I'll handle it.
OK.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
I saw that.
We'll keep that between you and me.
Where's the ladies' room?
This way. I'll show you.
Is that soda?
Vodka. Thank God.
Damon, right?
John.
We didn't get a chance to meet at the council meeting.
Yeah. It's... it's a pleasure.
Are you enjoying the, uh, kick-off?
Oh, yeah. Forgot how much fun
these small-town celebrations can be.
Yeah. Yeah.
When's the last time you were here?
Hasn't been that long. My brother's funeral.
How long have you been in town?
Well, not long at all.
So what do you think, Damon?
You know this vampire problem is real, right?
It's a potential blood bath.
I wouldn't overreact, John.
Oh, I think it's like 1864 all over again,
vampires running amok.
Guess we're just gonna have to hunt them down,
throw 'em in a church, and burn them to ash.
That is the story, huh?
Part of the story, yeah.
Oh, there's, uh... there's more?
Oh, there's a lot more.
You see, seems there was a tomb under the church
where the vampires were hidden away,
waiting for someone to come along and set them free.
But then you already knew that, didn't you?
Being that you're the one that did it.
And you're telling me this, why?
I just thought we'd get the introductions out of the way.
Well, you know that I could rip your throat out
Before anyone would notice.
Yeah.
Yeah. OK.
But you probably ingest vervain, so...
Why don't you take a bite, find out?
It's not worth my time.
Jer.
I, um...I heard about your conversation with Sheriff Forbes.
No one is trying to figure out what happened to her.
They're willing to believe that she ODed.
The coroner's office confirmed it.
If that's what they said happened, then...
Is that what you believe?
What do you think happened?
I think somebody killed her and buried her body,
And I don't think we should write it off just 'cause it's easy.
They're just doing what they can to move on.
The truth is the only thing that's gonna help people move on.
Jer, just... just let it go. OK?
Whatever it was, she's gone now.
Whatever it was?
So you don't think it was an overdose.
Yes. I...I do.
Is there something you're not telling me?
Why aren't you looking at me?
Stop it. That doesn't mean anything.
If there was something else, you would tell me, right?
Of course I would.
Oh, God. I ca... I can't even walk.
I know. Me neither.
Oh, God. Matt's gonna kill me.
Ah, he won't even notice.
I think he's actually letting himself have some fun for once.
Yeah, well...well, I know I'm supposed to be
On my best behavior because of Vicki,
but I don't wanna think about it.
I can't, 'cause if I do...
Yeap, I was a dick to her.
I was really bad.
That's what I hate
is I can't make any of it right.
It's like I don't deserve to even miss her.
You're nice to talk to me.
I don't have anyone to talk to.
I don't have anyone to talk to either.
Who knew I'd be missing all the fun at the founder's parties?
This is rare, believe me.
Is it bad that I'm, uh, enjoying myself?
No. It's great that you're enjoying yourself.
Thanks for making me dance.
Hey, not a problem.
Air. Ah heh.
Air. I need some air.
Um, come with me?
Sure.
You havet seen my mom, have you?
Um, no. Not in a while.
All right.
Oh, my God.
What the hell are you doin', man?!
Matt...
Mom!
Whoa. Dude, calm down.
Matt! No!
Stop it!
Tyler!
Tyler! Stop it! You are hurting him
Somebody's help us.
Stop! Tyler! Hey!
What the hell was that?
Here, Matt, get up. Are you OK?
What the hell was that?
I'll take it from here. I'll take it from here.
It's all right. It's OK.
You hurt?
Go get cleaned up. It's OK.
Go get cleaned up.
Thank you for your help.
Everything's fine. Everything's fine, everybody.
Come on. Everybody back to the party. Let's go.
Come on. Have a good time.
Are you OK? Where is she?
I don't know.
Come on. Put your head up.
Do you wanna hear the bad news or the really bad news?
Hmm. Actuay I don't want any news, Damon.
All right, let me rephrase.
Do you wanna hear
how the council's back in vampire mode
Or how I just killed uncle John Gilbert?
What?
Great party by the way, huh?
Damon.
Is everything all right?
No.
I...I ruined it.
I always ruin it.
What is wrong with me?
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
You've gotta be kidding me.
Thank you all.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you all for joining us tonight.
In just a few moments, we will officially begin the countdown
to our upcoming Founder's day celebration,
And it's a very special one this year,
The 150th birthday of our town.
And...and I would like to welcome back
one of our town's favorite sons
to do the honors of ringing our official charter bell.
John Gilbert, would you please join me up here?
150 years of community, prosperity, family.
We take care of each other,
Look after each other,
Protect each other.
It's good to be home.
Look at his right hand.
Whose?
The town's favorite son. Look at his ring.
Oh. That looks like mine.
Yeah, and that would be a big coincidence
if he didn't just come back from the dead 5 minutes ago.
Where the hell did you get that ring?
Isobel, my wife.
Who gave birth to Elena
under the medical care of the esteemed
Dr. Grayson Gilbert, John's brother.
Oh. You think John knew Isobel?
I think John knows a lot of things.
Take care.
Have a good night.
Sorry about that, man.
No, really, I'm terribly sorry.
You don't wanna do this, man.
Sorry about that, too.
God, all I can do is apologize.
What's that about?
Get out of my way, please.
No girl to show off for now?
I see how this is. Heh.
Wh-what are you, man?
Stefan.
Stefan.
Hey. Hey, are you OKey?
What happened?
My arm.
I lost my balance and fell.
I'm clumsy.
Let's go.
Dad, I'm sorry.
I don't even know what happened.
I was drinking, and...
I lost control.
Can't explain it..
That is the last time you ever embarrass this family.
What are you doing?
Matt, don't.
I can't do it anymore, Mom, so just go, all right?
You've done it before and more times than I can count.
I'm not leaving you.
Matty.
Mom!
Don't you get it?
I'm better off without you.
No.
Tonight was a...
God, I'm so sorry.
I know I failed you, and I failed Vicki,
But I won't do it to you again.
I promise I'll get it together.
I want you out of the house...
and my life by morning.
Matty.
Goin' somewhere? Hmm?
Never like to be the last one to leave a party.
It's too desperate.
You here to kill me again?
Or you gonna let Mr. Saltzman do your dirty work?
OK, you obviously know who I am.
I do. Alaric saltzman,
A highchool history teacher with a secret.
Sure know a lot for someone who just got to town.
More than you can imagine, Damon.
My knowledge of this town goes beyond anything that you
or you or the council knows.
So if you were planning on some clever high-speed,
snatch-ring, vamp kill move,
Know that if I die
everything I know goes to the council,
Including the fascinating little tale
of the original Salvatore brothers,
and their present-day return to mystic falls.
How'd you get the ring?
I inherited one,
My brother Gray, the other. This was his.
And I wouldn't have given mine to Isobel
Had I known she'd hand it over to another guy.
So you did know her.
Who do you think sent her your way
when she wanted to become a vampire?
You sent her?
Guilty.
Why, did you think someone else sent her?
Maybe Katherine Pierce?
How do you know about Katherine?
How do I know anything, Damon?
What do you want?
So many questions.
It was a pleasure meeting you, Rick.
I've heard so much about you.
Not so excited that we have
another month of these founder's day events.
Tell me about it.
You Okay?
Fine.
Are you sure?
I'm fine, Elena.
Oh, my God. You scared me.
Sorry.
I'm sorry that I... I ran off earlier.
What happened?
Is everything OK?
No.
Talk to me.
Stefan, tell me.
I tried...
So hard to keep it together tonight.
And it was working. It was working,
Uh, but...but then Matt's mom, she, uh,
got hurt, and she was bleeding,
and I had her...her blood on my hands.
And then what happened?
And then that...that guy in the parking lot,
I wanted to feed on him,
and it took everything inside of me not to do it.
But you didn't?
No, but I wanted to.
God.
Elena, I...my...
My head is pounding,
I feel like my... my skin is on... is on fire.
I have this hunger inside of me that I've never...
I've never felt before in my entire life,
And all I keep thinking about
is how I promised that
I would never keep anything from you,
and so I'm telling you this.
That's OK. I need you to tell me these things.
But I don't want you to see me like this.
I don't want you to know that this side of me exists.
Stefan, you're gonna get through this.
I'm gonna help you pull through.
It's gonna be OK. You're gonna be OK.
No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
No, I'm sorry. I...I can't.
I-I'm afraid of what I could do to you.
I'm not.
Stefan.
Stefan, I'm not.
I'm not, OK?
I love you so much.
Oh, I love you, too.
We have a problem, Stefan.
And when I say, "problem," I mean global crisis.
Seems uncle John has a...
You don't look so good.
It's different this time, isn't it?
The need is too strong.
Of course it would be after all these years.
