goro shioma was my father &apos;s mentor .
i offered to buy him out , but he wouldn &apos;t accept .
he said the only way out was to leave with nothing .
delivery , mr. and mrs. noshimuri .
now all you have to do
is give my friend damon here the account codes .
the transfer &apos;s now complete .
you had to give gabriel the money .
if you hadn &apos;t , we &apos;d both be dead .
we had two yakuzas sitting outside our house yesterday .
you know how shioma operates .
if he sent men to hurt us ,
we never would have seen them , okay ?
he &apos;s just posturing , trying to intimidate us .
tom bishop , i work for goro shioma .
out of respect to your late father ,
mr. shioma wants to resolve this situation peacefully .
this is gabriel waincroft &apos;s most trusted soldier .
if anyone knows gabriel &apos;s whereabouts , it &apos;s him .
i find it hard to believe you brought me here
just to watch you beat the information out of him .
we &apos;re not going to question him-- you are .
he &apos;s telling the truth-- he doesn &apos;t know where gabriel is .
well , we tried , right ?
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s all on you now .
mr. shioma wants what you owe him ,
and he wants it soon .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
i just need more time .
mr. shioma has given you over a month
to make good on your debt-- time &apos;s up .
what about my wife ?
as far as i know , he has no intention of hurting her .
no , that &apos;s not good enough .
i need some assurance .
goro shioma is not like your father .
he &apos;s a man of honor .
this debt is yours and yours alone .
just let me call her , man . to say goodbye .
you know i can &apos;t do that .
this doesn &apos;t change anything .
hey , this is kono .
leave a message and i &apos;ll call you back-- mahalo .
hey , kono , it &apos;s me .
call me as soon as you can .
i , abby dunn , do solemnly swear
to faithfully support the constitution
and the laws of the united states of america in the state of hawaii .
and to act at all times to the best of my ability and knowledge .
and to act at all times to the best of my ability and knowledge .
... &quot; best of my ability and knowledge . &quot;
in a manner befitting an officer of the law .
in a manner befitting ...
... &quot; an officer of the law . &quot;
congratulations .
what you doing , jer ?
nothing .
can you believe this ?
she &apos;s been in hawaii 15 minutes
and she &apos;s already getting sworn in .
i &apos;ve been here for years .
well , pump your brakes there , mulder .
she &apos;s not official five @-@ 0 .
we &apos;re just swearing her in on a temporary basis
&apos;cause she &apos;s shadowing us for a couple of weeks , that &apos;s all .
besides , jer , you should feel proud .
san francisco pd &apos;s putting together
a task force based on what we do .
you &apos;re a part of that .
this is for you .
thank you .
ah , i think i need to sit down .
gentlemen , i &apos;d like to introduce you to inspector abby dunn .
abby , this is lieutenant chin ho kelly .

special consultant jerry ortega .
special consultant jerry ortega .
it &apos;s nice to meet everyone . i &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
inspector dunn was just telling me
about the task force she &apos;s heading up in san francisco .
yes , inspectors stone and keller
are two of my best .
they don &apos;t exactly do well with rules ,
so i &apos;m pretty sure they &apos;re going to enjoy
having immunity and means .
what about you ?
i &apos;m still getting used to the idea .
well , i &apos;m from chicago-- i spent 25 years
trying to cut through red tape .
believe me , it won &apos;t take long .
chin , once the inspector checks in to her hotel ,
would you show her around a little bit , please ?
yeah , my pleasure .
thank you .
see you soon .
absolutely .
oh , excuse me .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , sir .
welcome to hawaii .
let me take a picture .
i got it for both of you .

we &apos;ve got keys and a phone , ring ...
oh , baby . oh , you &apos;re so hot .
oh , i knew i shouldn &apos;t have left you alone .
oh , my god , that &apos;s my husband !
oh , my god , that &apos;s my ...

i got it .
i think i &apos;m gonna like this aloha spirit .
excuse me .
so , where you staying ?
moana surfrider .
oh , nice .
right by the beach .
yes .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait !
hold it .
hey , jer .
chin .
new lady .
uh , basement , jer ?
you mean my clandestine five @-@ 0 office ?
yes , please .
so , san francisco , huh ?
yes , born and bred .
you know , more than one person escaped from alcatraz .
uh , i did not know that .
yes , um , well , i &apos;ll see you around , jerry .
special consultant ortega .
yes , sorry .
you &apos;re new .
mistakes are gonna happen .
we haven &apos;t house @-@ trained him yet .
i was down at the beach .
i came back up to the hotel room
to see if katie wanted lunch .
and that &apos;s when ...
i found her ...
‭ it &apos;s okay .
so i called the police .
yeah , we , uh , we ran
your partner &apos;s prints-- katie dawson .
she must &apos;ve been busy lately .
she was arrested for petty theft .
she &apos;s also a person of interest
in a life insurance scam in california .
did you know about that ?
according to the palm springs police department ,
she had a partner named albert keating ,
who matches your description perfectly .
but they disappeared before the police could question them .
well , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m not al keating .
uh , my name is hank webber .
i &apos;ve never even been to palm springs .
oh , okay .
he &apos;s good .
that &apos;s pretty , pretty solid .
that &apos;s a pretty solid performance . yeah , very good .
what are you talking about ?
it says here , &quot; albert keating .
president , sunset investment , palm springs
&apos;you &apos;re never too old to start saving . &apos; &quot;
maybe it &apos;s his twin brother .
you got a twin ?
okay , all right , uh , all right .
all right , all right , you got me .
you got me , okay ?
full disclosure-- katie and i ?
we came to hawaii to work the tourists , you know ?
we wanted to leave palm springs , fresh starts
simplify , change it up a little bit .
so we went with the badger game .
it &apos;s where you target married men .
and you catch them with their pants down literally .
they run out .
we take their stuff .
but this ? this is ...
this is crazy .
well , it &apos;s lucky you weren &apos;t in the room , huh ?
if you think that i had anything to do with his , you &apos;re wrong .
i &apos;m wrong ?
okay , katie was more than a protege to me . we ...
we had something .
okay , stop , please , okay ?
hank , you are a con man , all right ?
therefore , we do not buy what you are selling .
you understand ? save the steppenwolf for the tourist .
duke ?
do me a favor-- take our friend here
over to the palace and make sure he finds a seat in rendition .
put some handcuffs on him , too .
whoa , whoa , whoa , okay , timeout , hold on .
am i ... is @-@ is this ? am i under arrest ?
you &apos;re not under arrest , not yet .
i &apos;m just want to make sure
you don &apos;t steal my buddy &apos;s wallet on the way out .
nice and tight , nice and tight .
let &apos;s go .
what do you think ?
i think he probably pissed off enough people
and karma caught up with him .
i just feel bad for the mark .
okay , yeah , but it doesn &apos;t make any sense to me .
who kills somebody over a wedding ring and some cash ?
hey , what do we got ?
um , so , hank and kate
checked in the hotel this morning
under the names marshall and april carter .
yeah , they paid cash for the room
and the reservation was for one night only .
but their return flight isn &apos;t until the end of the week .
okay , they got to have another room someplace else .
yeah , why would they do that ?
to cover themselves . hank &apos;s not a moron .
he &apos;s smart enough to know you don &apos;t sleep where you steal .
what , you read that on a t @-@ shirt or something ?
oh , this guy can &apos;t read-- what are you talking about ?
okay , danny and i are gonna try to find
this other hotel room , wherever it may be .
you guys , talk to security here , please .
okay , hank said that katie was seducing married men in the bar .
okay , they got to have cctv in there .
let &apos;s try to i.d. those guys .
one of them could be our shooter .
okay .
hey , kono , it &apos;s me .
call me as soon as you can .
what &apos;s the matter ? you all right ?
everything all right ?
uh , i don &apos;t know .
you go ahead .
i @-@ i &apos;ll be right there .
okay .
are you okay ? i got your message .
i &apos;m fine .
no big deal .
i was just wondering if you knew when you &apos;d be home .
i thought we could go out , grab dinner ?
oh , that sounds like fun .
um , but i &apos;m gonna be working late .
all right , we &apos;ll play it by ear then .
okay .
i love you .
i love you , too .
charming place .
mcgarrett brought the concept of rendition
over from the military .
have a seat .
okay .
our interrogation tactics , however unorthodox ,
do yield immediate results .
huh , where &apos;s the interrogator sit ?
we don &apos;t .
and that &apos;s to our advantage .
we sit , we get comfortable .
which means they get comfortable .
and we never want them to get comfortable .
good , yeah .
i &apos;ve got a question .
um , what the hell is this drain for ?
use your imagination .
yeah , i &apos;d rather not .
well , i &apos;m impressed .
thank you .
i can think of a few cases where having
a room like this would &apos;ve been helpful .
yeah .
excuse me .
lieutenant kelly .
i &apos;ll be right there .
well , looks like we caught a new case .
come on , i could use a hand .
when were they discovered ?
about an hour ago .
ship &apos;s captain found the bodies , called port authority .
this was an execution .
they &apos;re all part of the same crew .
what do we know about the ship they came in on ?
arrived a couple hours ago .
originated from shanghai .
we checked the manifest-- four containers are missing .
how &apos;d they get past security ?
they didn &apos;t .
i got my guys checking the port for them now .
what kind of cargo were they bringing in ?
according to the captain , it was mostly kid &apos;s toys .
this was a smuggling op .
shanghai to the mainland
with inventory clearance at a low volume port of entry .
mostly likely narcotics .
enough weight to justify killing five men over .
now i &apos;m impressed .
all right , where is it ?
whoa , starsky &amp; hutch , it &apos;s a little vague .
we just went to your other hotel room
and it &apos;s completely tossed .
all right , so whoever killed your partner
went there looking for something .
probably what you stole from them .
so , what could be so valuable
that you took that &apos;s worth killing for ?
i don &apos;t know .
okay , try again .
no , i &apos;m telling you i don &apos;t know .
uh , we @-@ we just took wallets off the guys from the hotel .
we grabbed the cash .
we tossed the rest .
could somebody please tell me what the hell this drain is for ?
all right , listen to me .
the two married guys that you scammed ?
they alibied out , okay ?
which means you took more stuff from more people .
so , you either gonna tell us about that ,
or i &apos;m gonna show you what that drain &apos;s for .
okay .
okay , uh , maybe we took a few small items
from the airport when we landed .
just a few ?
fine , maybe more than a few ,
but it was just normal stuff .
it was luggage , cell phones , watches .
normal stuff-- nothing worth killing a person over .
okay , well , clearly the person who killed your partner
felt differently about that .
yeah , well , you know , whatever it is they were looking for ,
they &apos;re not gonna find it .
why &apos;s that ?
because katie pawned everything right after the score .
so , whatever they &apos;re looking for , it &apos;s gone .
okay . i want the name of the pawn shop .
yeah , i don &apos;t know that .
it was katie &apos;s contact .
you know , i let her sell the merch .
it &apos;s kind of like honor among thieves .
okay , you realize whoever bought all that merchandise
could be the next target , right ?
i mean , the shooter &apos;s not gonna stop
until he finds what he &apos;s looking for .
all right , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m undoing this man &apos;s cuffs , danny .
i see that . why are you doing that ?
because we need him .
you need me .
oh , god help us .
wow , this is a nice office .
this is ... pretty windows .
yeah , listen to me-- keep your hands where i can see them .
you steal anything , i &apos;m gonna shoot you .
yeah , i will not .
uh , you know , i don &apos;t , i don &apos;t know-- sorry .
i don &apos;t know the laws here on the islands .
but isn &apos;t that a little extreme for larceny ?
oh , that &apos;s funny . you think i &apos;m kidding .
no , sir .
in fact , i think that happy @-@ go @-@ lucky
got beaten into submission
by ornery and forceful while you were still in the womb .
where are we with the trace on the pawn shop , kono ?
all right , i pinged katie &apos;s cell phone .
and it registered at two cell towers this morning .
one in waikiki near their hotel .
the other one in chinatown ,
about a half @-@ hour after they checked in .
problem is there &apos;s about a dozen pawn shops in that area .
it &apos;s gonna take a minute before we can figure out
which one she went into .
well , why don &apos;t you just track the gps from the rental car ?
what rental car ?
the one we boosted from the airport .
didn &apos;t i-- ? did i mention that ?
no , you didn &apos;t mention that , hank .
where is it ?
it &apos;s valeted at the hotel where we were ,
we were conducting our business .
okay , i &apos;ll head over , check the car &apos;s gps .
see if i can get us an address of the pawn shop .
thank you .
okay .
um , can i can get a cup of coffee ?
i &apos;m having a little trouble adjusting to the time change .
all right , we need to pull the manifest from hank &apos;s flight .
and every other flight that landed in honolulu
around the same time .
you , you &apos;re gonna pick out all the people
that you and katie stole from .
one of them could be our shooter .
okay , but i &apos;m just telling you ,
i &apos;m useless without caffeine .
how do you take it ?
black ? couple cubes of shut the hell up ?
yeah .
two , two cubes and then some cream .
that be awesome .
and then , of course , your wallet .
sorry , you @-@ you &apos;re probably gonna want that .
i took it .
oh , hell no .
you know what , you can get your own damn coffee .
what did i tell you ?
what did i tell you , huh ?
i know , it &apos;s ...
put your hands on the desk .
it &apos;s a--
keep them there .
i can &apos;t help myself .
close your mouth .
by me .
heard you had a rough morning .
you don &apos;t want to talk about it ?
that &apos;s fine with me .
you could at least say thank you .
we both know you didn &apos;t do this for me .
i &apos;m a businessman .
i don &apos;t want a war .
this man has no honor .
he attacked my wife , stole my money ,
executed two of your men .
goro , we wouldn &apos;t be here if he hadn &apos;t intervened .
he &apos;s made amends for that .
how much did he pay you on top of the debt ?
enough .
and still you sent your men to kill me .
actually , that was on me .
i had some other business to conduct this morning .
otherwise , i would have made the deal with goro sooner .
and you wouldn &apos;t have had to kill those two men .
our business is concluded .
you are free to go .
i killed two men .
for nothing ?
uh , him .
not her , not him .
her , that woman who looks like she was born to knit .
that kid .
the kid ?
yeah , i took a pair of beats off him .
look , richie rich was sitting in first class .
did you ever fly first class when you were a kid ?
yeah , no .
i mean , i guarantee you that his parents
are gonna buy him a brand @-@ new set of headphones
as soon as they get to the hotel .
that &apos;s the last of the passengers .
that &apos;s everybody .
all right , got 12 potential suspects ,
not including the kid .
all right , let &apos;s , uh , let &apos;s put tsa alerts out on all of them .
i don &apos;t want anybody leaving the island
until we have a chance to talk to them .
yeah , kono , you locate that rental car ?
i did , and i was able to get an address off the gps .
tracked back to waiwai nui pawn shop in chinatown .
okay , great . send it through to me , okay ?
good work .
you , you &apos;re coming with us--
you &apos;re gonna pick out all the items you stole . let &apos;s go .
hello ?
five @-@ 0 , anybody here ?
looks like , somebody likes cats .
who doesn &apos;t ? huh ? who doesn &apos;t ?
put the cat down .
hey , back door &apos;s open .
looks like he &apos;s got an apartment upstairs .
door &apos;s been forced open .
either of you guys read stephen king ?
i mean , i @-@ i don &apos;t think we should go up these stairs .
keep your voice down and stay close .
no , i &apos;m good , i &apos;m gonna stay right here .
let &apos;s go , please .
five @-@ 0 !
clear .
i got blood .
is he dead ?
no , hank , he &apos;s , uh , he &apos;s just taking a nap .
we &apos;re gonna defrost him though , just to double @-@ check , you know ?
that &apos;s ... is that ... that &apos;s ... is that ... are you joking ?
all right , so max said the c.o.d.
was a single gunshot wound to the chest .
uh , csu found , uh , a shell casing , 0.22 caliber .
same as our other vics .
how about time of death ?
we &apos;re not sure .
the fridge was turned all the way up .
it affected the body temp .
max is gonna get back to us after the autopsy .
all right , so shooter takes out katie and her mark ,
doesn &apos;t find what he &apos;s looking for ,
goes over to hank &apos;s other hotel room .
uh , strikes out there as well .
right . somehow , he figures out
that all roads led to the pawnshop .
oh , this piece here .
we swiped using &quot; oops , sorry &quot; routine .
the execution , flawless .
people work hard for this stuff .
and you just take it ?
don &apos;t you feel the least bit guilty about it ?
aw , that &apos;s sweet .
don &apos;t go changing .
everything accounted for ?
uh , well , i remember swiping a digital camera that is not here .
okay , maybe that &apos;s what our shooter was after .
would you recognize the guy you took that camera from ?
yeah , sure , we did the &quot; bump and grab . &quot;
i looked him right in the eyeballs .
but i &apos;m gonna tell you something .
it wasn &apos;t one of those fancy top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line cameras .
just a little , like , cheap @-@ o 20 @-@ meg deal .
not worth more than maybe a hundred bucks .
it &apos;s not the camera they were looking for ,
it &apos;s what &apos;s on it .
hey , lou . you , uh , you get anywhere
with the passengers hank picked out ?
we cleared 11 of the 12 suspects .
nine of them had solid alibis at the time of the murder .
the other two were on connecting flights
to other islands at the time .
which leaves only one guy we haven &apos;t been able to reach .
his name is andy kaelani .
he &apos;s kama &apos;aina .
lives over in pearl city .
he &apos;s got an assault charge stemming
from an incident earlier this year .
well , he &apos;s got a violent side-- he could be our shooter .
send me through the picture-- i &apos;ll show it to hank .
all right , sent it your way , boss .
thanks .
is that the guy you grabbed the camera from ?
yeah . yeah , that &apos;s him .
all right .
looks like we got two sets of tire tracks .
a deal went down here .
i.d. is just came in on our dead crew members .
turns out , they all had red notices on interpol .
ex @-@ chinese military .
all wanted in connection to illicit arms dealing .
four containers at 48 feet .
that &apos;s a hell of a lot of guns .
yeah .
anyone going after that much firepower
is either gonna sell it or looking to start a war .
thanks , duke .
when you really think about it , commander ,
you pulled the perfect &quot; velociraptor con &quot;
on detective williams .
i mean , you took his car before he even knew it was happening .
furthermore , you &apos;re not giving it back .
which , according to the laws of this great country ,
is technically stealing .
detective williams drives his car home every night , okay ?
you know , buddy , if i &apos;ve offended you in any way ,
i take it all back , you &apos;re good with me .
we &apos;re good ?
yeah .
yeah ? you want to bro it up ?
no , i don &apos;t want ...
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s too much ?
a little bit .
okay , you-- stay . you don &apos;t move .
that is fine by me .
after seeing the pawnshop guy stuffed in the frigerator ,
i &apos;m happy to stay right here .
shut up , okay ? don &apos;t move .
five @-@ 0 !
clear .
clear .
steve , gun !
hank , hank .
hank .
give me the gun , hank .
give me the gun .
what the hell happened ?
he came out of there , he had a gun in his hand ,
he was heading for the house , i had to do something .
i tackled him , the gun went off .
okay , take it easy .
i think you just saved our lives , hank .
i guess you guys are rubbing off on me , huh ?
kaelani &apos;s gun was a .22 .
same as the other shooters .
you all right ?
uh , no .
it took a lot of courage to do what you did , hank .
i mean , if this guy had got a shot off ,
it would have been one of us
they &apos;d be taking pictures of right now .
thank you .
also , we found this inside .
that &apos;s the camera .
all right , let &apos;s go see what &apos;s on it .
what ?
okay , this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
they &apos;re all vacation pics .
none of them are even remotely suspicious .
why go through all that trouble to get &apos; em back ?
because he &apos;s not after the photos .
wait a minute .
lou &apos;s right .
there &apos;s got to be something embedded on this .
that would explain a lot .
i &apos;ll get it to jerry .
so ... what now ?
well , ballistics were a match on the 22 that kaelani had on him ,
so as far as we &apos;re concerned , we got our shooter , right ?
so that just leaves me .
i guess so .
given your cooperation in this murder investigation ,
and your heroics ,
we &apos;ll talk to the p.a. &apos; s office ,
get your charges reduced .
you &apos;ll do a couple of months , tops .
a couple of months ? really ?
i thought you guys had juice .
no , no , no , he &apos;s right .
let &apos;s , uh , let &apos;s skip calling the p.a. &apos; s office .
he could probably use the solid full rehabilitation time .
that &apos;s good idea .
no , no , no , no .
we &apos;re good . i &apos;m good , yeah .
so i appreciate that and thank you ,
and i &apos;m glad that i was able to help you guys out .
and if there &apos;s anything you need in the future ,
you don &apos;t hesitate to ask .
you know where i &apos;ll be .
i got one .
maybe you try a different profession when you get out .
you mean like a @-@ a real job ?
‭ yeah , no .
how about i just wait until i &apos;m out of your jurisdiction ?
i &apos;m kidding , i &apos;m kidding , i &apos;m kidding .
okay , look , why don &apos;t you take hank back to his hotel ,
get his things ,
take him over to hpd for processing .
be my pleasure .
hey , you &apos;re not , you &apos;re not still mad at me
about stealing your wallet , are you ?
what do you think ?
&apos;cause , uh ,
you &apos;re gonna hate me now .
i did it again .
that &apos;s funny .
maybe we &apos;ll stop at the hospital on the way .
okay , well , good @-@ bye , fellas .
it &apos;s been a slice .
bye , hank .
i &apos;m good .
i &apos;m good .
you know , i never thought i &apos;d meet anybody
more frustrating than you .
oh , that &apos;s nice . you just compared me to hank ?
on irritation level , yes ,
you two are very similar .
is that right ?
where you going ?
i &apos;m going to get coffee wit somebody .
is that all right ?
who you going to get coffee with ?
none of your business . how &apos;s it your business ?
is it that girl you hung out with last week ?
what did i just say to you ?
is that her right now ?
&apos;cause if it is , let me talk to her .
i &apos;ll set her straight .
no , no , you won &apos;t talk to her .
you &apos;re never even gonna meet her . it &apos;s max , by the way .
max .
hold on , what ?
you sure about that ?
okay , thanks .
what ?
max just said the pawn shop owner died
four hours before katie dawson .
doesn &apos;t make sense .
if kkaelani already had the camera ,
why would he go back and kill katie ?
he didn &apos;t .
he didn &apos;t . we &apos;ve been played .
guys , look , look , i know i pissed lou off ,
but to have him bring me back here ?
this @-@ this is just cruel .
cruel ?
well , kind of like shooting your partner .
excuse me ?
that @-@ that &apos;s cruel .
you tried to scam us .
you went for the long con ,
and you were this close to making it work .
this right here ,
this is what it was all about , right ?
uploading this memory card
onto our system .
you see , this is a virus , isn &apos;t it , hank ?
and this virus allows you to spy on our mainframe .
oh , man .
i love you two like brothers .
i really do .
so please don &apos;t be offended
when i say this ,
but , uh , i think i need to talk to my lawyer .
hank , you know how it works down here .
you don &apos;t get a lawyer unless we say you get a lawyer .
detective williams , come on , buddy .
help me out here . i mean , i don &apos;t know
where he got these ideas from , but he &apos;s wrong .
no , i don &apos;t think he &apos;s wrong .
pawn shop owner &apos;s time of death is what gave you away .
the refrigerator was a great idea .
you cool the body down , you &apos;re gonna delay the tod .
you knew we were gonna find out eventually .
see , you got sloppy , buddy .
everything else was brilliant .
driving the rental car to the pawn shop ,
make it look like katie drove there , perfect .
we get to the hotel room ,
you made it look like somebody beat us to it , fantastic .
then you went and killed your partner .
oh , my god ! that &apos;s my ...
it was good .
i mean , the only thing left
was to frame the shooter , kaelani .
he was , he &apos;s the perfect target , you know ?
local guy , works out of his garage ,
had a shady background .
it was a perfect fit , right ?
somewhere in all this ,
you managed to get over to his house ,
plant the gun and camera .
then when we got to his place , you made sure
we went inside while you took care of the rest .
hank , hank .
you got it .
you got it .
if my hands weren &apos;t cuffed , i would applaud .
i knew i liked you guys .
and i got no room in my heart for chumps , you know ?
but you two , you guys are smart .
well , here &apos;s the thing .
you are not going to prison for just a couple of months .
you &apos;re gonna spend the rest of your life there .
i don &apos;t think so .
all right , i want to know who you were working for
and why they wanted access to our computers ?
i will do you one better , commander .
i will testify against them ,
and i will help you put them away
for immunity .
who is it , hank ?
gabriel waincroft .
where is he ?
i don &apos;t know .
don &apos;t lie to me .
i &apos;m not lying to you .
i &apos;ve never met him face @-@ to @-@ face .
okay , then how did you meet him ?
an associate put us in contact .
who ? who ?
uh , it was a guy named porter ,
but you &apos;re not gonna find him .
he shot himself two weeks ago .
he shot himself ?
you know , for a con man , you &apos;re pretty gullible .
all right , tell us how it went down with gabriel .
uh , well , he wired me a half a million dollars ,
uh , to start .
said he was gonna pay me five million when the job was done .
i knew i was gonna spend a little bit of time inside ,
but when i got out ,
i was gonna go back to l.a. a very rich man .
today &apos;s your lucky day .
because we &apos;re not gonna charge you for those murders .
you &apos;re gonna be booked for theft ,
then you &apos;re gonna get in contact with gabriel .
you &apos;re gonna tell him everything went down
just as you planned it .
if you do that , if you do that ,
maybe you won &apos;t spend the rest of your life in prison .
i @-@ i know what you &apos;re thinking , all right ?
but this is our only play .
we arrest this guy for murder ,
gabriel knows we &apos;re on to him .
okay , i understand all that ,
but what about the software that he uploaded onto our mainframe ?
we &apos;re gonna use it .
we &apos;re gonna use it to catch gabriel .
how are we gonna do that ?
we &apos;re gonna bait him .
oh , like , uh , misinformation ?
exactly , right .
when he bites , we hook him .
then we come back and we charge hank with four murders .
i like it-- the long con .
good . it &apos;s the only chance we got .
i &apos;ll reach out to a few cis
and see if they &apos;ve heard anything about a local arms deal .
i have a friend at the fbi who owes me a favor .
i &apos;ll ask him to put together a list of all known buyers .
anyone who has enough cash to make a shipment that big .
mahalo .
a &apos;ole pilkia .
no . a &apos;ole pilikia .
it was a six @-@ hour flight from san fran .
i got through most of the travel guide .
you know , i really appreciate you jumping in
with both feet on this one .
i was hoping this trip was gonna be more than just show @-@ and @-@ tell .
what do you think so far ?
i like what i see .
i &apos;m sorry . that came out sounding weird .
no , no . uh , no worries .
get out of the car , chin .
who is it ?
you can put your gun down .
i &apos;ll handle this .
you can stop looking for the stolen guns .
they &apos;re already off the island .
i should &apos;ve known it was you .
i was really just the middle man .
the chinese were greedy .
so i just took the guns .
i sold them to very motivated buyers .
made so much on the deal
i even paid off your cousin &apos;s debt .
you &apos;re lying .
even you &apos;re not stupid enough
to show your face in front of shioma .
he &apos;s got a price on your head .
not as big as what i paid him .
besides , it &apos;d be bad form for goro
to kill someone he just got into business with .
see , unfortunately for you ,
i now have the yakuza backing my every move .
didn &apos;t have to be this way , chin .
i came to you .
i offered you a chance to be a part of this .
you should &apos;ve taken it .
i should &apos;ve done a lot of things .
i &apos;m going to wipe that grin off your face soon enough .
promises , promises .
i got your message .
thanks for coming .
uh , what &apos;s going on ?
can i help you ?
i &apos;d like to report two murders .
you can find the bodies in the makua kea &apos;au forest reserve .
how do you know this ?
&apos;cause i put them there .
