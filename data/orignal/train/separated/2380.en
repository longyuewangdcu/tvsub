You took everything from me, Klaus.
Let bygones be bygones. Resentment gets old.
No one ever gets old? Revenge.
No.
What's the Matter, Klaus, missing something?
I will kill you and everyone you've ever met.
Do that and you'll never see your family again.
The spirits hate Klaus as much as we do?
They're using their powers to hide in the coffins.
It just won't open. I've tried everything.
And then it's closed with a spell.
He's been sired.
He feels loyal to Klaus because Klaus' blood created him.
I'm not giving Klaus anything.
He's gonna kill Jeremy.
Not really my problem.
Jeremy, move!
I have no idea how you're on your feet right now,
but I need to run some more tests.
Actually, I have someplace I need to be, doctor...
Fell.
Your sister thinks we should have another one of our talks.
You're going to leave Mystic Falls behind
and never think twice about it.
I thought for one second
that I wouldn't have to feel guilty anymore...
Guilty for what?
For wanting what I want.
You're gonna put a hole in that thing.
Wanna talk about it?
Nothing to talk about.
Morning.
You're late. We're supposed to meet Bonnie
at the old witch house in 10 minutes.
Relax, brother. You don't want your hair to fall out.
Would you hurry up? We have work to do.
You know, Klaus isn't going to spontaneously self-destruct.
Why are you all chipper?
No reason. Be with you in a minute.
So, uh, what's got you all worked up?
I didn't really sleep last night.
Yeah, me neither.
Probably something to do with dying.
Are you ok?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine. I think the ring, however,
is running low on batteries.
Yeah, it's another reason why Jeremy has to get out of town.
If those rings have a shelf life, he's not protected.
Neither are you.
Nice. Nice. You're getting stronger.
I'm channeling frustration.
I need coffee.
I guess Damon's compulsion worked.
Jeremy was packing when I left the house.
He was going on about his new schoolin in Denvor.
Have you, uh, talked to Damon today?
No.
Why?
No reason.
Phesmatos sapren emnis labortum fecils quisa exsilum son.
Phesmatos sapren emnis labortum fecils quisa exsilum son.
Uhh! Why won't you open?
Hello?
Is someone there?
You didn't say anything to Elena about the coffins, right?
No. I said I wouldn't.
I know what you said.
Then why are you asking?
Because protecting the location of Klaus' family
is my number one priority right now
and the fewer people who know, the better.
What?
These hybrids are really bringing the neighborhood down.
Hey, sorry I'm late.
I, uh...I got held up.
It's ok. I just got here, too.
Will you pass me the balloons?
Thanks.
What got you running late?
I, uh, was working on some new spells.
You?
Working out with Alaric.
卡罗琳
So, uh...
I have something I need to tell you...
And you're not going to like it.
What happened?
Jeremy's going to be leaving town for a while.
He'll be staying with some old family friends in Denver
until this whole Klaus thing blows over.
Jeremy wouldn't just leave you to deal with Klaus on your own.
I know.
I asked Damon to compel him.
You what?
I know, Bonnie.
But it's not safe for him here anymore.
Leaving will give him a better life.
The only reason I'm telling you is because I know
that you two haven't really worked out your stuff.
I kinda thought maybe you'd want to say good-bye.
You're wasting your time.
It won't open.
Did you bury the body?
Yeah.
Any sign of our little hybrid buddies?
Nope, just the dead one.
All right, Klaus has 6 siblings.
Rebekah is now with Klaus.
There was one dead kid in the old world,
one dead kid in the new world,
which leaves Elijah and 2 others,
3 sleeping originals, 4 coffins.
So, who was in the lockbox?
No idea. But whatever's in here,
Bonnie seems to think will help us kill Klaus.
So, as soon as you can get this thing open,
the sooner we'll know she's right.
You'd think the spirits of a bunch of dead witches
that can make a coffin invisible,
that they'd figure out how to open one!
Fine, don't help.
You know none of this is going to do us any good
if Klaus' hybrid friends find our hiding spot, right?
They need to go away.
Oh, yeah, that's a great idea, Stefan.
Why don't you just ask him to pack a bag
and take a long vacation while you're at it?
How about you keep the peace?
Don't draw attention to the very things
that we're trying to hide.
No. I'm not going to play defense
when I have what Klaus wants.
He does what I say
or I dump his family to the bottom of the ocean.
Then he kills you and everyone you know,
like, I don't know, me.
No, he's bluffing.
His family means more to him than anything else.
You sure about that?
Oh, I don't know, Damon.
I mean, I guess there's only one way to find out, right?
Call his bluff.
Whoa. The only way to call someone's bluff, Stefan,
is to be willing to lose everything if you're wrong.
Denver, huh?
So, were you going to say good-bye?
I wasn't sure you cared.
Of course I care.
I was hurt by what happened between you and Anna, Jeremy.
I don't want you to leave town.
I think this could be a good thing,
at least until all this Klaus stuff blows over.
I think I can have a better life there.
That's what Elena said.
It's exactly what she said.
What do you mean?
Nothing.
I'm just sorry you have to go, that's all.
I can't talk to you.
I know you're upset with me.
Upset?
But I...
You almost got Jeremy killed.
And before you ask me to understand or to support you,
can you at least tell me what you're planning to do
about your sire bond to Klaus?
There's nothing that I can do about it, Caroline.
That's the point.
I just wanted you to know that...
I understand why you can't be with me.
Even though I want to put you first, before anyone...
I can't.
I'll never be able to.
And I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I just wanted you to know that.
I'm sorry, too.
Happy birthday.
Sweet dreams, Rebekah.
Show her to her room, would you, love?
Sure.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
I gave you your freedom. You could have gone anywhere.
I live here, Klaus.
Well, if we're playing this game,
then, uh... I was here first.
You know, I don't like your hybrid friends.
They're everywhere, kind of like fleas.
I want them gone.
I kind of like having them around.
You know, I'm hurt.
I hoped that, uh, I'd free you
and we'd pick up where we left off,
but here you are,
guzzling vervain like the rest of them, I'm sure.
So much for friendship.
Friends don't strip friends of their free will.
Ok, granted, yeah, that was a little extreme,
but I get a little moody.
Just ask my siblings.
Speaking of whom...isn't it time you handed them over?
Klaus...
Get your hybrids out of Mystic Falls
or I will remove them myself.
You see, if you continue to threaten me,
I'm going to be forced to retaliate.
Kill people.
And it'll get messy again.
Do whatever you want. I don't really care.
Or you know what? Maybe I do.
Yeah, maybe I care so much
that I drop Elijah into the arctic.
Well, maybe I'd be willing
to lose one brother if it meant killing yours.
Try me. Let's find out.
Is everything ok?
Everything's fine, Mindy.
Stefan was just leaving after failing to make his point.
Well...one down.
You may want to, uh,
send the rest of them away before it gets messy...
again.
Surprise!
Surprise!
Happy birthday!
What are you guys doing here?
Well, you blew off school and missed our
work of birthday art, so, uh...
Change into warmer clothes, we're going to the Falls.
S'mores, campfire.
Cake. Like when we were little.
Except with tequila.
Ah, thanks, guys, really.
Um...I'm just not really feeling my birthday this year.
I'm sorry, what?
You've already claimed your birthday
as everyone's favorite day of the year.
Yeah. And now it's just a reminder
that, technically, I'm dead.
Look, I didn't even like 17.
The only point to 17 was to get to 18.
It's a filler year.
I am stuck in a filler year.
You're not stuck, Caroline.
Yeah, I am. But it's ok.
You know, it's all good. I will be fine.
But I just need some time to wallow in it.
Ok.
Well, I think I have another idea.
What do you want me to do with her head?
Just get rid of it. Burn it.
I honesty don't care, Daniel.
You called?
I'm here.
What happened?
What happened is Stefan had 2 paths in front of him
and he chose the one that made me angry.
I need you to help me do something about that.
Can't you just leave me out of it?
What would be the point in that?
Seriously, man, can't you just get
one of your other hybrids to do your bidding?
I lost my friends, my girlfriend.
Right, your, uh, your girlfriend.
Um, about her... I need you to bite her.
What?
Don't make me repeat myself.
A hybrid bite would kill a vampire.
Yeah, yeah. I know exactly what it will do.
Uh, Stefan pushed me too far, so I'm pushing back.
I'm not biting Caroline!
Tyler, I've been supernaturally blessed
with the good fortune of a sire bond to you,
so one could consider this
me putting your undying loyalty to the test.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I'm not hurting Caroline.
All right.
All right.
I'm disappointed, but you know,
it's your choice, free will and all that.
I'll find another way to strike at Stefan.
You can go now.
I thought Stefan saved your life.
He did.
And now he's willing to risk it
just to see how far he can push Klaus?
Seems so.
Well, is his humanity on or off?
Yeah, I'm thinking there's another option here in play,
a bit of a dimmer switch,
which is a huge problem.
Why?
Because I can't predict how far
he's willing to go until somebody gets killed.
Suddenly you care who lives or dies?
I have a small list.
Talk about humanity dimmer switch.
Screw you.
Can't the council meeting ever
just be a council meeting?
There it is.
This is creepy.
Even for us.
No, Caroline was right.
Technically, she's dead.
Sorry. But you don't need a birthday,
you need a funeral.
You need to say good-bye to your old life
so that you can move on with your new one.
Ok.
Here lies Caroline Forbes.
Cheerleader, Miss Mystic Falls,
third grade hopscotch champion.
Friend...daughter...
overachiever.
Mean girl, sometimes, no offense.
None taken.
She was 17 and she had a really good life.
So, rest in peace so that you can move forward.
That's what you really need.
It's what we all really need.
Amen or cheers or whatever.
Uh, Bonnie...
Nice.
Ok, make a wish.
This is the bridge where Elena's
and Jeremy's parents died in a car accident.
Something's up with her.
Elena. Something more than usual.
Do you know what it is?
Well, I'm sure it starts with a "stef" and ends with an "N."
I'm gonna get a drink,
write a check, and then we're out.
Well, Alaric Saltzman... Miracle patient.
Dr. Fell.
I'm glad to see you're still alive.
Half of me thought you'd drop dead in your sleep.
Yeah, well, I guess I have 9 lives.
Not a bad thing to have in a town with a vampire problem.
I'm--I'm sorry.
Are you on the founders' council?
I'm a founder. I come from a long line of founders.
May they rest in peace.
I hate that bridge.
My senior prom date dumped me on this bridge.
Oh, yeah? Did you throw him over it?
No, but I should have.
I've been holding a grudge ever since.
Where did your, um, friend go?
I'm supposed to hit him up for some money for the fundraiser.
Well, you should. He's loaded.
He's in good company.
Some british guy just pledged to match ever dollar we raise.
What do you mean, british guy?
You know, Carol, when I think of them now,
I think of an old fuddy duddy,
but you really have changed my perception.
Thank you.
You are just delightful.
What color are your eyes?
They're blue.
They are.
Look at what the cat dragged in.
Nice vest.
Well, thank you very much. Good to see you, Damon.
Carol and I were just discussing whether
you'd be tonight's other big benefactor.
What do you say, Damon?
Klaus has made a very generous pledge.
You know how we're chomping at the bit to begin the renovation.
Carol, don't take this the wrong way,
but do you realize that you've been kissing the ass
of an immoral hybrid who ruined your son's life?
Oh, come now. Some might say I saved it,
what all that nasty full moon business.
I never had to go through it myself
more than twice to be honest, but still... I'm very sympathetic.
Klaus has promised to protect Tyler, Damon, and our town.
From who? His hybrids are
the ones the town needs protection from.
Well, I'd have no use for them
if your brother would kindly return my family.
Not gonna happen.
That's what I thought, which is why I've come
to an agreement with the mayor.
You and the council stay out of my hair, I'll stay out of yours.
Your town gets protected,
hybrids get left alone and everybody will be happy.
All you have to do is to
get Stefan to stop decapitating my friends.
Please, Damon. Just get your brother under control
or the council will be forced to take action against him.
You've got to be kidding me.
Oh, come on, mate, give peace a chance.
I need it more than you do, trust me.
Caroline, what are you doing?
Hmm? Huh? Nothing.
Ok, you're a bad sober liar.
You're an even worse drunk liar.
I might have texted Tyler.
Caroline.
What? I'm delicate.
Give her a break.
You can't control what everyone does all the time.
Ouch.
I'm sorry. I know it's Caroline's birthday,
funeral or whatever, but...
I just feel it's really
wrong that you compelled Jeremy to leave town.
I'm doing it to protect him, Bonnie.
I want to give him a chance at a half-way normal life.
He should be able to choose how he wants to live it.
You're taking his choices away.
Bonnie, you can't tell him.
Why? Are you gonna compel me not to?
You know, you guys are ruining a perfectly good funeral.
I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna go sleep it off or something.
Happy birthday.
The Mayor's looking out for Tyler.
For now we have to assume Klaus has her in his pocket.
Oh, please don't tell me
you're going to drink the Klaus kool-aid.
I'm not going to let him hold this town hostage.
But I'm also not going to
let innocent people get caught in the crossfire
of a pissing contest between a hybrid and a vampire.
Liz, I'm impressed.
You're all strong and sherriff-y.
I'm not kidding, Damon. Get Stefan to stand down
from this one before someone gets hurt.
What are you doing? You're gonna ruin your career.
Says the guy who got his job from his dad.
Do you have any idea what you're messing with?
I know what I'm doing.
Damn it, Meredith.
Back off, Brian.
Whoa. Hey, is everything all right here?
Everything's fine.
It didn't look fine.
You might want to get to know her
before you become her white knight.
She's kind of a psycho case.
You're that guy, aren't you?
The one begging to have his teeth kicked in.
Take it from me, man, life's too short.
Just go away, Brian.
Behold...My senior prom date.
You definitely should have thrown him over the bridge.
Unfortunately, I have to work with him.
He's on the council, the medical examiner.
The guy who signs his name under cause of death, "Animal attack."
I get it.
Yeah.
Duty calls.
Thanks for the hero moment.
Anytime.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
No dead hybrids at the founder's party.
No. I told Klaus to get his hybrids out of town.
He didn't listen, so now I'm saying it louder.
You don't think there's 10 more where that came from?
And if you kill them, Klaus won't make 20 more?
Have you forgotten about Elena's part in all this
or do you not care if she's a human
blood bag for the rest of her life?
Protecting Elena is your problem now.
See, I'm not compelled by Klaus to do it anymore.
Don't give me that no humanity crap.
You can't just flip your switch.
Your switch is fried, Stefan, just like your brain.
You want to take Klaus, you want to beat the villain,
you got to be smarter.
To beat the villain, Damon, you have to be the better villain.
Sorry. I didn't mean to crash the party.
So don't.
No. It's, uh, it's ok.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
It's kind of important.
Are you ok?
Yeah. I want her to be happy, you know?
That's what I want for all of you guys,
in the middle of this crazy life you got stuck living.
Is that how you see it? That we're stuck?
I'd say its attached itself to all of you pretty tight, yeah.
Bonnie's right.
You know, I have no business messing in Jeremy's head.
I just didn't know what else to do.
He's in danger here.
I can't lose anyone else I love.
I take it all back.
Everything I said this morning.
Klaus can't control me.
Not when it comes to you. I won't let him.
Tyler, it's ok.
Maybe we just weren't meant to be together.
Maybe we just have to accept that and move on.
I'm not moving on from anything.
I love you.
What?
What just happened?
Oh, no.
Did you--did you just bite me?
Oh, my god. I'm sorry.
Oh, my god!
Oh, no. Caroline?
Oh, my god.
Caroline?
Just get away from me!
Get away from me!
Caroline?
Great.
We've been abandoned.
Ok, we're going into search party.
I don't trust that she won't get back together with him.
Caroline?
Come on, Caroline.
We don't have any more drinks.
Matt's being haunted by the fell ghosts.
Hello, Damon.
She's a little busy right now.
Why the hell do you have Elena's phone?
Making my next move.
Let me ask you something,
What's Klaus gonna do
if he can't make any more hybrids?
What?
Stefan, leave her out of this.
What are you doing?
Stefan, let me out of this car!
Do you hear me? Let me out of the car!
What now?
You just pulled me away from a fascinating conversation
about landscaping the town square.
Stefan just grabbed Elena.
What?
He's getting desperate.
He's gonna try to use her against you.
Do what he says. Get rid of your hybrids.
Or what? Stefan would never dream of killing her.
Are you sure about that?
He just tried to behead someone in the middle of a council party.
He's operating on crazy right now.
Well, crazy or not,
that kind of love never dies.
He's bluffing.
Maybe he is, maybe he isn't.
But if you don't want to believe him, believe me.
I know my brother better than anyone
and right now I don't have a clue
how far he's willing to take this.
So, if he says blink, I suggest you blink.
Sheriff Forbes!
What happened?
Tyler bit her.
Oh, my god. Sweetheart.
Be careful.
Oh, honey.
Caroline? Honey, can you hear me?
I'm sorry, mom.
She's been hallucinating or something.
I don't know. No one's picking up their phone.
It's all right, sweetheart.
So, what's the plan, Stefan?
What's the big move you're making?
I took Klaus' family to make him suffer.
I'm not going to let him make himself more.
So, then what are you going to do, huh?
Are you going to lock me in some cave and keep me hostage?
Maybe I'll just turn you into a vampire.
Stop the car, Stefan!
Stop the car, Stefan!
Stefan, how nice to hear your voice.
Tell your hybrids to get out of town, Klaus.
Well, that's not going to happen until I get my coffins back.
Ok. Well, then I'm going to drive
your blood source off Wickery Bridge.
I don't believe you, Stefan.
You won't kill her.
No! No! No!
What are you doing?
What's going on?
I just fed her my blood.
No more hybrids if she's a vampire.
You won't do it.
Really?
Try me because your coffins are next to go.
Say good-bye to your family, Klaus.
Stefan, slow down!
Stefan, slow down! Stefan, stop it!
Fine.
I'll send them away. You win.
Stefan!
Stefan, stop!
Stop the car, Stefan!
Get back in the car.
Stay away from me!
Elena, get in the car.
How could you?!
My parents died going over this bridge.
I almost died.
You knew that.
You're the one who saved me.
Look, he had to believe that I would do it, all right?
Your fear sold it.
Well, what if he hadn't?
He did.
Well, what if he hadn't?
He did, Elena! He backed down!
He has a weakness!
If I know his weakness, I can destroy him!
After everything, that's what mattered,
destroying Klaus?
Destroying Klaus is all I have left.
You had me!
I lost you the minute I left town with him.
You just haven't let yourself admit that.
Is that what you're doing?
Trying to make me hate you?
I don't really care what you think about me anymore, Elena.
Tyler came to see me.
Poor boy, he seemed quite distressed.
He said Caroline had had a terrible accident.
You made him do this to her.
He would have never done something like this.
I'm here to help, Matt.
My blood will heal her.
Please ask the sheriff to invite me inside.
I know how this game works.
You want something in return.
Just your support.
Come in.
Are you going to kill me?
On your birthday?
Do you really think that low of me?
Yes.
Oh, that looks bad.
My apologies.
You're what's known as collateral damage.
It's nothing personal.
I love birthdays.
Aren't you like... a billion or something?
We have to adjust your perception
of time when you become a vampire, Caroline.
Celebrate the fact that
you're no longer bound by trivial human conventions.
You're free.
No.
I'm dying.
And I could let you die...
if that's what you want.
If you really believe your existence has no meaning.
I've thought about it myself
once or twice
over the centuries, truth be told.
But I'll let you in on a little secret.
There's a whole world out there
waiting for you,
great cities and art and music...
Genuine beauty.
And you can have all of it.
You can have a thousand more birthdays.
All you have to do is ask.
I don't want to die.
There you go, sweetheart.
Have at it.
Happy birthday, Caroline.
Thanks for picking me up.
Anytime.
Are you going to be ok?
I'll survive.
Somehow I always do.
You know, Stefan won this round for us today.
He pushed Klaus over the edge.
Klaus blinked.
Well, his methods sucked.
Still, we needed it.
Klaus has been calling all the shots
and Stefan beat him at his own game.
He was the better villain.
Don't sound so impressed.
Well, can't help but feel a little proud.
Really, tell me, are you going to be ok?
You can't kiss me again.
I know.
I can't.
It's not right.
It's right.
Just not right now.
Good night.
Good night, Damon.
You're gonna have to let me go eventually.
Be safe, ok?
Yeah, ok, all right.
Alaric's waiting.
Good, you haven't left yet.
Hey, what are you doing here?
I came to say good-bye.
You're not going to jump, are you?
Thanks for coming.
I was just thinking about what you said,
about us being stuck.
I was buzzed, Elena.
I can't be held responsible for being judgmental.
I do feel stuck, Matt.
I feel like...I've been holding on to the girl
that was supposed to die here with her parents.
The girl that had a normal life
and didn't fall in love with vampires.
You're not that girl anymore.
It's ok if you want to let her go.
Is it?
Because I feel like
I've--I've disappointed her a little, like...
like I've disappointed them, my parents.
My 2 cents...
as a guy who knew that little girl,
you're doing a lot better than you think.
Here lies Elena Gilbert,
a fun girlfriend...
and an amazing friend.
Thank god. Another day-drinker.
I lost a patient.
What's your excuse?
Uh, well, I put a kid on a plane.
Yours?
No, that's a long story.
Then you should probably buy me a beer.
A hiker called it in.
My guys got here first.
Another hybrid?
That's what I thought at first.
Brian Walters, the medical examiner.
What's up with the stake? He's not a vampire.
I know.
