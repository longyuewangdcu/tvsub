i want to , uh ...
taupe .
is that ...
justice thomas .
i knew it .
what can i do for you , louis ?
ah , to the point . of course .
i wanted t ...
i wanted to congratulate you on bringing in pfister insurance
and let you know i &apos;ve taken the liberty
of putting together the initial paperwork .
excellent . leave it there .
i wanted to follow it through .
i would relish the opportunity to ...
nonsense . louis , it &apos;s beneath you .
oh , i think you &apos;ll find nothing &apos;s beneath me .
are you offering something untoward to me ?
i &apos;m simply saying that i &apos;m not oblivious to the fact
that there &apos;s change afoot , firm dynamic @-@ wise .
we used to be--huh .
now , we &apos;re kinda--hmm .
we might need a little .
you know ? louis .
i &apos;d like things to operate with a certain integrity around here .
oh , i admire that philosophy .
i actually try to live by it myself .
good .
now , can you do me a favor ?
anything .
send mike ross to me .
ross ? you want to work with ross ?
he &apos;s actually working for me right now
on the liquid water litigation ,
and he &apos;s been on it for weeks , and i wish i could do it ,
but i cannot . i can &apos;t do it right now .
then forget i said anything .
but i can give you dickinson .
okay .
let me know how that works out .
with ross .
okay .
um , i am taking mike exclusively for the next two weeks .
excuse me ?
i &apos;m calling in my chit .
our wager ? the price sisters ? my triumph ?
does that ring a bell ?
can &apos;t have him .
oh , well , then i guess you &apos;d rather
that i announce to the entire office
that the mighty harvey specter is a welcher .
i didn &apos;t welch . you passed on him .
okay , please . i &apos;m begging you . i need him .
okay , tell you what , louis .
just say out loud that i am the best closer in new york ,
and you can have him .
fine .
to donna .
no .
then we don &apos;t have a deal .
welcher .
that was fun . morning .
if that &apos;s a big check ,
i want another marni bag .
hands off the vinyl , junior .
10 : 00 , nice of you to join us .
i was closing cranston this morning .
oh , yeah ? couldn &apos;t get it done by 9 : 00 , huh ?
you &apos;re a little lippy for a monday .
what the hell ?
what ? what is it ?
&quot; draft of complaint from smith and devane ,
threatening to reopen randall v. cm , &quot;
a case i won 4 years ago .
randall v. cm ?
ah , accident on the merritt parkway .
they claimed it was coastal motors &apos; hood ,
you killed it in court by saying it was the driver .
this can &apos;t be surprising to you anymore .
they &apos;re saying there &apos;s new evidence .
new evidence ? it &apos;s product liability .
the statute of limitations is expired .
which means it &apos;s a shakedown .
you gotta quash that shit .
i do , and i will .
come on . the spinners ? really ?
for your information , the spinners were
one of the defining pop bands of their time .
oh . oh , wow , sorry .
yeah , that &apos;s cool , like , uh , like , the jonas brothers
or hanson or &apos; nsync or selena gomez , yeah .
come here , lippy . i want to show you something .
yeah ? what , you got bieber fever ?
prepare motions to dismiss by end of day thursday ,
and don &apos;t puss out when judge edelstein
tries to stifle my brilliance .
he &apos;s all yours .
what ?
why the sudden change of mind ?
does it matter ?
you &apos;re punishing him , aren &apos;t you ?
yes .
so you &apos;re saying
working for me is punishment ?
as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
this whole conversation &apos;s punishment .
oh , here we go .
duration ?
one case .
jurisdiction ?
exclusive .
what can i do to him ?
what do you want to do to him ?
harvey .
things .
that is not a legitimate answer .
honor the boundaries of labor law ?
i prefer the geneva convention .
then we have a deal .
we ...
i think i need a sick day .
careful there , harv .
that &apos;s high @-@ end brazilian cherry
from the south american rainforest .
tanner . you selling furniture now ?
no , but if we both did ,
i &apos;d sell more than you .
i thought i told you to stay out of my city .
can &apos;t . i &apos;m the newest senior partner
at smith and devane .
don &apos;t get too comfortable .
if all you &apos;re bringing is the boston shakedown ,
you &apos;re not gonna be here long .
oh , i &apos;m bringing more than that , harvey .
randall versus cm is a winner .
that case was litigated .
not by me .
well , let me bring you up to speed .
frank randall had a history of substance abuse .
his family tried to blame coastal motors ,
but his death had nothing to do
with the carmaker or its design .
yeah , well , we &apos;ve got new evidence
that contradicts that assertion .
oh , look at that , you learned some new words .
even if it were true , the statute of limitations ran out .
well , what you call a shakedown ,
i call a sure thing .
this is an internal memo .
showing that cm knew about engineering defects .
you &apos;re on the wrong side of this one , harvey .
i never saw this thing in my life .
sure looks like you did , and that statute of limitations
doesn &apos;t apply to fraudulent concealment .
i didn &apos;t conceal jack shit .
harvey , that &apos;s for your client .
we want $ 46 million and not a penny less .
and this , well , that &apos;s for you
because we &apos;re suing you and your entire firm for fraud .
you really want to come after me again ?
i &apos;m not moving down here for the sushi .
0 @-@ 2 doesn &apos;t look good on a resume .
you know , i &apos;m thinking upper east side .
well , why don &apos;t you check out
the corner of 81st and kiss my ass ?
this looks bad , harvey .
i don &apos;t care how it looks , it &apos;s bullshit .
then tell me what &apos;s bullshit because i &apos;m looking at
a document that undermines your entire defense .
an anonymous memo with names and dates blacked out .
it &apos;s damning , and it implicates you in a cover @-@ up .
never crossed my desk .
i &apos;m not saying it did . i &apos;m saying it looks bad .
i don &apos;t want daniel knowing about this .
i got nothing to hide . i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
i believe you , but you &apos;re not my only concern at the moment .
you know full well what daniel will do
if he finds out you &apos;re being accused of fraud
and it happened on my watch .
he &apos;ll use it against us , but i also know
that he &apos;s familiar with the people at cm ,
and he &apos;s bound to find out sooner or later .
then make it go away before it gets to sooner .
durham foods vs. liquid water .
i need motions to dismiss , compel ,
strike , and change venue .
why are they not finished yet ?
okay , louis , i might be a quick study ,
but i &apos;m gonna need a tad more information than that .
have you heard of liquid water ?
yeah , sure . liquid water . &quot; we put the i.q. in liquid . &quot;
you see ? you already know the client .
what did they do ?
they didn &apos;t do anything .
they &apos;re being accused
of coming up with a deceptive slogan .
by durham foods .
exactly .
they have their own line of bottled water , which ,
by the way , tastes like a stagnant pond .
so how do we defend against their claim ?
who said anything about &quot; we , &quot; white man ?
my defense is puffery .
oh , you &apos;re gonna stick out your chest ?
no , mike , &quot; puffery &quot; is ...
a big , bold , empty statement
not meant to be taken as fact , therefore
not subject to deceptive advertising litigation .
touche .
see ? it &apos;s a solid case .
i agree . no one would actually believe
that drinking liquid water would raise your i.q.
i mean , who would be that stupid ?
i mean , other than people who actually drink ...
liquid water .
you know what ? whatever .
just don &apos;t mention that last part in the deposition ,
okay ?
yeah , okay .
wait , louis ?
um , if we &apos;re claiming puffery ,
why do i need to waste all my time with these motions ?
all right , let me explain something to you .
we &apos;re at war , and in times of war ,
a private does not question his commanding officer .
if i ask you to wipe out a village ,
you say , &quot; how high ? &quot;
that ...
which brings me to my next point .
you report to me and me only .
you don &apos;t talk about our business with anyone else .
you &apos;re in by 7 : 00 , you &apos;re out no sooner than 10 : 00,
and here &apos;s the most important thing ,
no sex of any kind .
weakens legs , clouds your judgment . got it ?
i &apos;m not sure i do .
good .
okay .
no sex .
no sex .
got it .
oh , my god .
well ?
oh , my god .
donna , i need to know if you ever saw this .
yes , harvey , i saw the smoking gun
in a multimillion @-@ dollar liability claim ,
and i hid it from you .
i also know where amelia earhart &apos;s living , and i have
the missing 18 minutes from the watergate tapes .
all right , take it easy .
i don &apos;t like having my competence questioned .
yeah , and i don &apos;t like being sued for fraud .
that document never came into this office ,
or you would have seen it .
donna , two dozen people worked on this case ,
and any one of them could have seen it and missed it .
i need to know that didn &apos;t happen ,
or i need to know who to fire .
give me an order .
go through every file in the original case
and make sure that document isn &apos;t in them ,
and do it without anyone knowing .
done .
okay , ha ha , joke &apos;s on me .
aren &apos;t you louis &apos;s boy ?
yes , i get it . no more fondling the vinyl .
or besmirching the good name of the spinners .
yes , i totally deserve to be handed over
to the poor man &apos;s lex luthor for that .
please , harvey , you have to get me back .
have to ?
will you ?
he thinks we &apos;re going to war .
he give you the &quot; burn down the village &quot; speech ?
yes . what is it with him ?
it &apos;s like the pony thing all over again .
he &apos;s , like , the captain of mixed metaphors .
look , i can &apos;t take you back now .
i have to honor my bet ,
especially since my honor &apos;s in question .
okay , why are you strangely emphasizing the word &quot; honor &quot; ?
this letter of complaint .
i &apos;m being accused of fraud by travis tanner .
isn &apos;t that like the pot accusing the kettle of ... fraud ?
i &apos;m going to the airport to talk to cm right now .
i want to reassure lawrence kemp
that we &apos;re all over this .
please , harvey , come on . take me with you .
i can do this . i can work for both of you .
it &apos;s too risky . i &apos;m solo on this .
besides , i &apos;ve got a relationship with kemp .
i should talk to him alone .
not a word to louis . understand ?
yeah . hey , he said that i can &apos;t have sex
while i &apos;m working with him . is that really his call ?
well , he is your commanding officer .
you looking for civil torts , volume three ?
people put that in criminal law . i hate that .
yeah , i know . me too .
oh , i knew we had something in common .
you need my help ?
ah ... no , i &apos;ve actually got it right ... there .
i &apos;m sorry . i was just trying to help you .
harold , you &apos;re the associate ,
and i &apos;m the paralegal .
it &apos;s my job to help you , not the other way around .
i don &apos;t see us that way .
okay , um , you want to help me ? my ... my stapler is broken .
could you get me a new one ?
i &apos;ll get you three .
harold .
thank you .
good to see you , lawrence .
harvey , good to see you .
sorry this had to be on the fly .
it &apos;s not a problem .
i want to start by giving you my word
that we crushed this suit once ,
we &apos;re gonna to crush it again .
i should hope so .
i was hoping to have this discussion privately .
well , this is our new general counsel , matt lasker .
he insisted on being part of the discussion .
forgive me , i &apos;m just getting up to speed .
then you should know that ...
out of curiosity ,
why did you receive a draft of the complaint
before we did , mr. specter ?
travis tanner gave me an advanced copy .
must like you .
we have a special relationship .
which i &apos;ve looked into .
harvey ,
he really seems to have a bone to pick with you .
that &apos;s not gonna be a problem .
it may be for us .
tanner came to see you , didn &apos;t he ?
at our request .
lawrence , i &apos;m telling you ,
we can handle this .
we just need to stick together .
look , if i &apos;m going to defend us against this suit--
&quot; if &quot; being the operative word .
am i being fired ?
we &apos;re keeping you on retainer
while we evaluate our options .
don &apos;t you see , tanner &apos;s trying to put a wedge between us ?
what lawrence is reluctant to tell you is ,
your relationship with this man
has put us directly in his crosshairs .
there is a wedge between us .
maybe lawrence &apos;s reluctance stems from the fact
that i also have a relationship with him .
harvey , i have a corporate responsibility here .
well , while you &apos;re evaluating your options ,
why don &apos;t you think about
who was there for your company four years ago
and what happened to your stock price after i won .
oh , you got paid very well for that .
as were you .
you had a huge bonus that year ,
and i don &apos;t actually recall it ever going back down .
there &apos;s no need to get personal .
you ... our asses are on the line ,
and you &apos;re trying to cut me loose , it &apos;s personal .
harvey .
save the &quot; it &apos;s not you , it &apos;s me &quot; speech , okay ?
be a man and make a clean break .
fine .
no .
you &apos;re fired .
he &apos;s on record .
remember i told you it was too risky
to work with me and louis at the same time ?
yes .
we have to take that risk .
i need you to go through every file in this case .
you mean you want me to find what you missed ?
i didn &apos;t miss anything .
i need you to go through those files
and tell me what &apos;s not in there . shit , i gotta go .
what happened ?
well , i got good news and bad news .
what &apos;s the bad news ?
i got us fired .
what &apos;s the good news ?
anything we find from here on out
is no longer covered by attorney client privilege .
did you find what you &apos;re not looking for ?
no , did you find what you &apos;re not looking for ?
nope . oh , my god , it is so stuffy in here .
what are the symptoms of carbon dioxide poisoning ?
headaches , dizziness , mental confusion ,
mental confusion .
kevin , trusts and estates ?
no , it &apos;s too meek . it &apos;s gotta be a woman .
who is it ?
harold . i need a stapler .
i was right .
okay , there are files everywhere .
he &apos;s gonna be suspicious . what do we do ?
don &apos;t worry , i got it .
i got this .
what are you ...
come here .
what &apos;s going on ?
come in .
hi , harold , honey .
is this why it says , &quot; do not enter ? &quot;
we &apos;re kind of busy in here . do you mind if , um ...
you know ...
you just don &apos;t bother us anymore ?
sure . no problem .
yeah , he didn &apos;t notice the files .
oh , shit , i &apos;m late for louis &apos;s settlement conference .
uh , and ... thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
and then i take the shuttle to grand central ,
and then i take the local from there .
i think you &apos;ll find that ... pleasurable , actually .
sorry , restroom .
no , that &apos;s okay . this is my associate , mike ross .
he was busy , uh , drafting some pertinent documents .
motion to dismiss , motion to compel ,
motion to strike , motion to change venue ,
and we have another half dozen in the pipeline .
no , they &apos;re here .
what is this ?
this was supposed to be a settlement conference .
oh , we &apos;re not here to settle . we &apos;re proceeding to trial .
you want to take this case to trial ?
unless i can &apos;t hear the sound of my own voice ,
i believe that &apos;s what i just frickin &apos; said .
we &apos;re the little guy .
your parent company &apos;s a behemoth .
a jury &apos;s gonna hate you .
well , thanks to your disgusting smears in the media ,
that might be true ,
which is why we &apos;re also filing a countersuit
for libel , slander , and anything else
that might be appropriate in this case .
tortious interference ?
this is ... you got ... this is not good faith , mr. litt .
sir , you have besmirched the good name of liquid water ,
and if you think that we &apos;re here for a settlement conference ,
well , let me just correct that one for you right now .
we are not settling . we will not be settling .
in fact , the only thing that &apos;s settling here
is the sediment at the bottom of your putrid water . get me ?
now be sure to take that grand central shuttle
like i told you , okay ? i think you &apos;re gonna love it .
uh , that was ...
amazing ? i know .
i &apos;m sorry , louis , that i , uh
questioned my orders ? i know .
i thought it was just busy work .
well , it wasn &apos;t . for every hour you spent drafting them ,
they &apos;re gonna spend ten hours
figuring out how to argue it back in court .
you &apos;re gonna bury them in paperwork .
look at you .
you catch on quick . what happens next ?
they squirm for a day or two , reevaluate ,
and come back to us on our terms .
like ... tomorrow , maybe ?
tomo ...
mike . sweet , impressionable , young mike .
you see , unlike what harvey believes ,
going to trial is a good thing ,
especially when the other side can &apos;t afford it .
durham foods , their financials are soft ,
but it &apos;s gonna take a trial to put &apos; em down ,
so you better lace up your bootstraps
&apos;cause this battle could take months .
uh , where you going ?
uh , i just have to go back ...
to , uh , the bathroom .
you just went .
are you keeping track ?
i may start .
i don &apos;t mean to intrude , but donna &apos;s not at her desk .
do you have a minute ?
i overstepped last week . i want to make up for it .
it &apos;s not necessary , daniel .
pfister insurance , i thought ,
maybe we could handle them together .
i &apos;m gonna to have to take a rain check .
it &apos;s a peace offering , harvey . take it .
you know , i &apos;m sorry ,
but my plate &apos;s just a little full at the moment .
do you mind if i ask with what ?
uh , the usual . i have six situations ,
all in need of immediate attention .
which begs the question , why not add one more ?
i &apos;ll see if i can free up some time next week , okay ?
um ... i think i didn &apos;t find something .
who let me not have it then .
during the two years before our car was manufactured , there was
this mid @-@ level quality control manager named sarah layton ,
who wrote several reports
on other cm car models
but never on ours .
so she &apos;s not relevant to our case .
it would appear that way ,
but after may 5th , 2006,
she never wrote another report ever again .
that &apos;s kind of a coincidence , isn &apos;t it ?
that on the exact date that our car went into production ,
she disappeared from cm &apos;s records ?
she could &apos;ve just been fired .
never filed for unemployment .
could &apos;ve quit .
no exit interview .
permanent unpaid leave .
gets out of any records .
and nothing to tie her to our car .
she wrote that memo .
very smart .
thank you .
i meant them , not you .
but i found it . that makes me even smarter .
don &apos;t be cocky . it &apos;s unbecoming
on you . i can pull it off .
you better be nice to me because i know where she lives .
where who lives ?
my high school sweetheart .
we connected on facebook .
oh . bullshit , you &apos;re not that sentimental .
yes , i am .
she was his first .
deposition tomorrow . be ready .
first ?
i had to sell it .
give me the address and tell donna to hurry up .
i &apos;m naked to the world down here .
harvey , there is one problem .
if this woman wasn &apos;t involved in the original cover @-@ up ,
she &apos;s not gonna want to talk to
a lawyer who isn &apos;t on her side anymore .
well , i better think of something on my way down there .
i went to the file room to get you the good stapler ,
but there was a bit of a snafu .
in the file room ?
i don &apos;t want to get into it .
in the meantime , i brought you my own personal stapler ,
a two @-@ hole punch , three @-@ hole punch , old @-@ school wite @-@ out ,
and enough highlighters to last you till kingdom come .
look , harold , i @-@ i know
that you don &apos;t see us as paralegal and associate ,
but i think it &apos;s best from now on
that i just help you .
because the truth ... the truth is ,
you are far too valuable to be wasting your time on this .
i am ?
you &apos;re right .
yeah .
and besides , you probably don &apos;t want all this stuff , anyway .
well , there &apos;s that .
except for the stapler , of course .
you got it . of course . thank you .
sarah layton ?
you recognize me .
i do .
then you know who i work for .
coastal motors .
i &apos;m not gonna deny that .
what do you want ?
we have a problem .
i need you to tell me everyone you &apos;ve ever shown this to .
i never showed it to anyone .
ms. layton , i don &apos;t care that you wrote it .
you made a deal to keep your mouth shut ,
and i believe you kept it .
all i care about is who else read it .
i don &apos;t know who else read it ...
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t write it .
ms. layton ...
i brought my concerns to mr. kemp .
he told me not to put anything in writing , and i never did .
good .
i need you to swear to me
that you never told anyone
other than lawrence kemp about the flaws in his hood .
you listen to me .
he promised he &apos;d fix the problems on the line
if i kept quiet . he did ,
but he never went back and fixed the ones we already made ,
and that man died .
i have been living with that ever since .
now get off my property , and leave me the hell alone .
furniture salesman to limo driver .
you &apos;re stepping up in the world .
well , it &apos;s nice to know you still have a sense of humor , harvey ,
considering you just learned you defended a murderer .
i should &apos;ve known you &apos;d have me followed .
follow you ? i &apos;ve been waiting for you .
i told you , you &apos;re on the wrong side .
i don &apos;t defend murderers .
that &apos;s not what that woman just told you .
you wanted me to find her .
you have the document . no proof of fraud .
can &apos;t admit it without fraud .
now that you know kemp lied on the stand .
i &apos;m obligated to come forward and tell the court . otherwise--
even if you weren &apos;t guilty of fraud then ,
you &apos;ll be guilty of fraud now .
of course , when you do come forward ,
it &apos;s going to be awfully hard for people to believe
you didn &apos;t know about it at the time .
you know i didn &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know anything of the kind .
what i do know is , you &apos;re in a bind .
i wouldn &apos;t wait too long now .
i &apos;d hate to have to report you to the bar .
lawrence goddamn kemp .
harvey , i need this suit quashed , and i need it done now ,
so channel your anger and find a way out .
i mean , i knew i had an enemy in tanner , but--
did you ever think that the person you should be mad at
is yourself ?
excuse me ?
law 101 .
don &apos;t ask your client if he committed murder ,
but sure as hell find out if there &apos;s a smoking gun .
jessica , i &apos;m sorry , i wasn &apos;t born yesterday ,
but he swore to me there was nothing wrong with that car ,
and i believed him .
well , he lied to you .
it &apos;s not the first time , and it won &apos;t be the last ,
but now tanner knows it .
i guess it &apos;s time to tell daniel .
what ? now ? no .
i just had the chance to tell him , and i didn &apos;t .
why not ?
because you told me not to .
the one time you listen to me .
no , no , no , no . you can &apos;t lay into me
every time i go against you and then flip it around now .
we &apos;re not telling . i &apos;m gonna fix it .
well , the one way to fix it is to negotiate a settlement .
oh , wait , we can &apos;t because you got us fired .
i did , which means there &apos;s nothing stopping us
from strong @-@ arming them .
i gotta go .
just admit it . your research suggests
that consumers believe your water tastes like shit .
do i have to answer that ?
what exactly are you getting at , mr. litt ?
what i &apos;m getting at is , mr. kessler is aware of the fact
that his company &apos;s product can &apos;t compete with ours
&apos;cause it tastes like shit ,
and they resorted to filing a bogus lawsuit
against us in a desperate attempt to hide that fact .
no , you don &apos;t have to answer that .
hey , mike--
yeah .
thanks .
kevin , right ?
how long have you worked at durham foods ?
22 years . i started right out of college .
that &apos;s dedication .
i admire that .
what &apos;s your current title ?
vice @-@ president of market research .
it says here , three years ago ,
you applied for senior vice president ,
but they gave the job to an alan stansby instead ,
a man who had been at the company far shorter than you .
correct .
well , how &apos;d that make you feel ?
yes or no questions .
my client &apos;s not here to discuss feelings .
okay , truthfully , you were hoping to be
further up the corporate ladder by now , weren &apos;t you ?
maybe .
ok , thank you , mike .
and once again , recently you applied for a senior vp position
and were turned down . is that correct ?
yes .
you do know that management
is going outside the company to fill the job , right ?
objection . lack of foundation .
you know what ? i am so sorry . that was--
that &apos;s off the record .
that &apos;s just because of a headhunter friend of mine--
that &apos;s not--no , we object to that too .
i &apos;m warning you , mr. litt .
i &apos;m sorry . statement withdrawn .
you know , you can tow the party line , kevin ...
but i know exactly
what it &apos;s like to bust your ass every day at a company
and be overlooked for a promotion time and time again .
it just ...
hurts .
just physically hurts .
right here .
give 110 % every day , and for what ?
so they can just ... chip away at your dignity ?
you can be the , uh , loyal soldier today ,
be the cannon fodder for your bosses .
or you can turn the guns on &apos; em right now ,
and you can just tell me the truth .
we &apos;re done here .
it &apos;s true .
kevin .
our product sucks .
no , objection .
you can &apos;t object to your own witness .
we &apos;re suing &apos; cause we &apos;re losing market share .
kevin .
there &apos;s nothing wrong
with your ad campaign , and that &apos;s the truth .
thank you , kevin .
louis , that was awesome .
that was pretty spectacular , wasn &apos;t it ?
his testimony is gonna be amazing .
i got him to admit some damning things , didn &apos;t i ?
you know , we should subpoena the outside company
that put together the focus groups .
yes .
we should get all their records ...
like it .
and the names and addresses of the people who took part .
they &apos;re protected in civil actions
under the privacy statute of &apos; 74 .
no , that was overturned by kressler v. symtech .
not if they &apos;d been compensated ,
as is this case right here .
we &apos;re gonna win this thing .
&quot; if i can &apos;t win , i won &apos;t run . &quot;
what ?
&quot; if i can &apos;t win ,
i won &apos;t ru-- &quot; that &apos;s chariots of fire .
come on . do you--don &apos;t tell me you don &apos;t know that film .
you know , like what you and harvey do ,
the--the movie quotes .
i forgot . it &apos;s--yeah .
well , it &apos;s been a long time since i saw it .
you know , it &apos;s a great , great flick though .
yeah .
anyway , all right . so ...
make sure the subpoenas are on my desk in the morning .
oh , mike ...
make it the afternoon &apos; cause you &apos;ve earned it .
good night , tommy .
good night
lawrence , what a coincidence ,
me running into you in your own building .
i certainly wasn &apos;t waiting for you .
harvey .
ah , it &apos;s better this way .
your new lawyer won &apos;t hear what i have to say
and be put in a position to commit fraud ,
like you did to me .
i don &apos;t know what you think you know , but it &apos;s wrong .
i know about sarah layton .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
but whatever you know , harvey , is privileged information .
not if i found out yesterday ,
and definitely not if you conspired for me to commit fraud .
there &apos;s no fraud .
she found a problem , and you tried to--
and i fixed it , and there &apos;s no record !
that &apos;s what a solid front end feels like ,
but you didn &apos;t make one ,
so when frank randall &apos;s car hit the divider
at 50 times the force that you just felt ,
it crumpled and split him in half .
then i savaged his reputation ,
all because you looked me in the eye
and told me that your hood was rock solid .
what do you want , harvey ?
what you should have done in the first place .
pay these people and make this thing go away .
if you don &apos;t , i &apos;m coming forward
and telling the court what i know .
even if i didn &apos;t want to ,
i &apos;d have to , but i want to ,
and when i do ,
coastal motors is gonna cut you loose
exactly the same way you did to me .
so either you make it right on your own , or i will .
hi , i got subpoenas .
i said the afternoon .
it &apos;s the first thing in the morning .
war doesn &apos;t wait for the afternoon .
sweeter words have never been spoken .
gentlemen , before you do any more work ,
durham foods is declaring bankruptcy .
yes .
damn .
damn ? we win .
no , now if there &apos;s a judgment on the countersuit ,
we &apos;re gonna be in the back of the line behind a dozen lenders .
sorry . i know you &apos;ve been working on this for weeks .
uh , yeah . yeah , well , what are you gonna do ?
we can still get a win @-@ win out of this whole thing .
how ?
well , you said that
their other products are worth real money , right ?
so why don &apos;t we just advise liquid water
to buy the whole company and then just give up the suit ?
we kill the competition and get their other products
at a discount to market value .
win .
win .
why &apos;d you cover for me ?
what do you mean ?
with hardman out there .
you let him think that we were working together .
in the deposition yesterday when you were--
you know , when you were talking about not--
i &apos;ve just really enjoyed working with you , louis .
you have ?
yeah , sure .
well , i thought harvey might have poisoned the well
in regards to any relationship between the two of us .
louis , can i be honest with you ?
yeah , i can keep it real .
as far as poisoning the well goes ,
harvey didn &apos;t really have anything to do with it .
that &apos;s pretty much all been you .
what are you talking about ?
among other things ,
you tried to sabotage my relationship with jenny .
after you laughed at that video of me .
you stuck me in housing court .
&apos;cause you stole a client from me .
you tried to blackmail me with a fake drug test .
yeah , but it didn &apos;t work .
you defeated me .
so ?
so it &apos;s water under the bridge .
no , no , no . not water under the bridge .
louis , you can &apos;t do that to people
and expect them to forget about it and move on . don &apos;t you get that ?
they should .
would you ?
okay .
mike , i will take your thoughts ...
on my behavior under advisement .
wait , mike ?
yeah ?
something &apos;s in the air still like a pall of
secrecy or a layer of unease .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
mm , my spider parts are tingling .
please don &apos;t ever say things like that .
harvey &apos;s up to something . i know it .
what is he up to ?
i don &apos;t know .
you sure ?
yes .
um , louis &apos;s parts are tingling .
i don &apos;t want to know what that means
or how you know that .
it means he knows you &apos;re hiding something .
well , if everything goes like i expect ,
there won &apos;t be anything to hide .
good , because it just doesn &apos;t feel right lying .
you know , i actually kind of like working with him .
he &apos;s not a bad lawyer .
i mean , you know , we have fun .
you guys thinking about moving in together ?
jealous ?
where &apos;s your gatekeeper ?
any tom , dick , or harry can just waltz right in .
well , i don &apos;t see any toms or harrys here , but--
okay , can we just please cut the small talk
and you let me know what i &apos;m not privy to ?
i don &apos;t know what imaginary world
you &apos;re skipping through right now , louis ,
but you &apos;re there all by yourself .
right .
so first you hand me ross on a silver platter ,
then donna &apos;s not at her desk for days .
you think that i don &apos;t know that there &apos;s a power struggle going on
between jessica and hardman ?
harvey , look ,
i admit i haven &apos;t always been , um ...
well @-@ behaved .
but i can help you on this . you just gotta trust me .
louis , go away .
that was harsh .
you kidding me ?
he came hat in hand , harvey .
have you met him ? this guy gets one whiff
of what we &apos;ve been hiding from hardman ,
i guarantee you it &apos;s his office he &apos;s in , not ours .
i know , we can &apos;t trust him .
still , you should have seen him in this deposition .
i mean , all he wants is to be you .
isn &apos;t that what everybody wants ?
i &apos;m serious , harvey .
well , i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s just pathetic .
i know , but what i &apos;m--
harvey specter .
harvey , it &apos;s lawrence kemp .
give &apos; em what they want .
good .
is that it ?
you want a medal ?
for what it &apos;s worth , i never meant
to put your reputation on the line ,
and that memo never crossed my desk .
good @-@ bye , lawrence .
they &apos;re settling ? you wanted that ?
wanted it ? i goddamn orchestrated it .
cm pays what they should have in the first place .
and the suit against us goes away .
and daniel hardman &apos;s none the wiser .
where the hell &apos;s donna ?
she &apos;s in the file room .
hasn &apos;t found that document yet .
there is no document .
so you believe him ?
not really . i just remember
who we &apos;re dealing with .
harvey .
what are you doing here ?
nothing .
just delivered cm &apos;s settlement offer to smith .
or devane .
i can &apos;t remember , i can &apos;t tell those guys apart .
it &apos;s not their case .
no , but it is their firm ,
and i don &apos;t trust you .
our offer was take it or leave it .
well , we took it .
and now we &apos;re done .
hmm , well , i &apos;m afraid there &apos;s still the little matter
of our fraud claim against you .
tanner , i &apos;m glad you did what you did .
the randall family deserved that money ,
but let &apos;s not pretend you &apos;ve got shit @-@ on me .
excuse me ?
you used that memo to get what you wanted .
but it never would have held up in court
because you wrote it .
that &apos;s a scintillating argument .
too bad not a word of it &apos;s true .
well , let &apos;s take a look at your resume .
witness tampering , extortion , bribery .
forgery fits right in .
that document &apos;s the real deal , harv .
and as far as reputations go ,
i know all about your dirty dealings in the d.a. &apos; s office .
unlike your theories about me , you were actually investigated
for the very thing you &apos;re being accused of , burying evidence--
a point i can &apos;t wait to bring up in court .
you &apos;re the one with the problem , harv .
you know i didn &apos;t do this .
hey , thanks for settling the case for me , buddy .
but i said i wanted a pound of flesh from cm and you ,
and i meant it .
that was harsh .
you kidding me ?
he came hat in hand , harvey .
have you met him ? this guy gets one whiff
of what we &apos;ve been hiding from hardman .
i guarantee you it &apos;s his office he &apos;s in , not ours .
i know , we can &apos;t trust him .
still , you should have seen him in this deposition .
i mean , all he wants is to be you .
isn &apos;t that what everybody wants ?
i &apos;m serious , harvey .
i &apos;m sorry . that &apos;s just pathetic .
i know , but what i &apos;m--
bothering you ?
no . no , not at all .
i heard about your proposal to buy durham foods out of bankruptcy .
impressive .
well , the way i see it is a win @-@ win .
way to think outside the box .
it was actually mike ross &apos;s idea .
i &apos;m glad to see it all worked out .
louis ...
you seem upset about something .
is there anything you want to tell me ?
jessica pearson , leading by example .
spare me the charm , harvey . give it to me straight .
cm settled . $ 46 million .
1 / 3 to frank randall &apos;s widow ,
the rest into a blind trust for his children .
you &apos;re pleased with that ?
damn straight i am .
when &apos;s the other shoe gonna drop ?
what makes you think there &apos;s another shoe ?
it &apos;s tanner . there &apos;s always another shoe .
they &apos;re still coming after us for fraud .
it &apos;s time to pay the piper .
you want to tell him , or shall i ?
well , we &apos;ll worry about that tomorrow .
what the hell gives you two the right
to hide a lawsuit against my firm from me ?
daniel--
i am not done yet .
when were you planning on telling me this ?
when the case went to court ?
when our malpractice insurance ran out ?
are the two of you so shortsighted
that you would allow your distaste of me
to impair your ability to run this firm ?
when you came five years ago to blackmail me , i was furious .
you told me that i was blaming you for my own actions .
i wasn &apos;t just embezzling , but i also tried to cover it up .
well , that &apos;s what you were so busy doing the other morning ,
covering it up .
you had the chance to tell me , and you didn &apos;t .
no , i didn &apos;t .
why ?
i don &apos;t trust you .
that &apos;s not true .
he didn &apos;t tell you because i don &apos;t trust you .
tell me you &apos;re not gonna use this as some power play .
that &apos;s exactly what i should do .
but i am gonna give you the chance
i have been asking you to give me ,
the chance to redeem yourself .
how ?
they &apos;re not just coming after you .
they &apos;re coming after all of us .
pearson . hardman .
what are you proposing ?
we fight them together .
okay .
you trust him ?
at the moment , we don &apos;t really have a choice .
looking good , louis .
you &apos;re supposed to say , &quot; feeling good , billy ray . &quot;
you know , trading places . movie quotes , it &apos;s what we do .
you want something ?
uh , well , i just heard
that you ran with my idea about buying out durham foods .
and hardman told me you gave me the credit ,
so ... team litt @-@ ross .
i told him because i don &apos;t like to owe anyone anything .
you covered for me with him earlier , so i threw you a bone .
now we &apos;re even .
where &apos;s this coming from ?
i &apos;ll tell you where it &apos;s coming from .
you were right . actions have impact .
so you want to remember the marijuana and tennis thing ?
well , i &apos;m gonna remember things too .
how &apos;s your budding bro @-@ mance with louis ?
evidently , it &apos;s over .
so fickle is the heart .
what &apos;s going on with you ? why are you being so ... weird ?
tanner took the deal .
so it &apos;s done .
no . he &apos;s still coming after me for fraud .
and a lot of people are gonna think i buried that document .
how can you bury what doesn &apos;t exist ?
doesn &apos;t matter .
they &apos;ll think it happened once ,
it could happen again .
so why are you smiling ?
because i know what they don &apos;t .
you &apos;re gonna beat tanner .
i &apos;m not just gonna beat him . when i &apos;m done with him ,
his own mother won &apos;t even recognize him .
ah , that &apos;s where you are . i &apos;ve been looking for you .
you okay ? you look like you &apos;re gonna be sick .
oh , god , you know , actually , i do ,
i feel like i &apos;m coming down with something .
do you think that maybe you could grab me a water ?
