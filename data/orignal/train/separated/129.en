第七季 第九集
Nice to see you again.
Let me know if I'm not in frame.
I can move down.
I'm not wearing a camera.
Oh, how considerate.
Let's skip the hostility, please.
She went out of her way to make us look like bigots.
I think I'm being pretty friendly, considering.
I can see you went with diversity in hiring.
How are Biff and Skippy?
Mike and Brian.
What can we do for you, Monica?
I can't imagine that you're here to apologize.
A friend of mine was recently run out of business
by a giant tech company.
I'm bringing suit.
And you don't have the resources to pursue the case on your own?
You said to call if I needed help.
You've complicated our relationship
since I made that offer.
True.
But at least we know we can be direct with each other.
Besides, it could be good for your image.
How?
The company I'm suing is even
more lacking in diversity than yours.
And what company is that?
Chumhum.
And you want us to help?
Well, actually, I need Lucca to help, but I know you two
have this Bert and Ernie thing going.
Well, why me?
Alicia's the one that's worked with Chumhum.
Well, it's a racism case.
And, uh, my firm's a little pale at the moment.
What an honor. My parents would be so proud.
Who's suing?
We used to booked up weeks in advance.
Our venison pot pie was written up in the Trib.
We were Zagat rated.
Then people just stopped coming.
It's hard not to take it personally when it's your baby.
And why is Chumhum responsible?
Their maps program-- Chummy Maps--
it's supposed to help users stay safe
by giving them directions
to avoid the dangerous parts of the city.
Green's safe, yellow's so-so,
and red means "Stay away."
When the filter's on,
driving directions avoid the red areas.
The filter is always on by default.
You have to manually turn it off.
So you lost your foot traffic?
And this-- watch when I toggle the filter on and off.
It doesn't show businesses in the red parts of the map.
When this came out, it was like I didn't exist.
It says this is an unsafe area?
Yes, a red zone.
It doesn't feel unsafe.
Yes, except for one thing.
Too many people of color.
Our maps are not racist.
It's run by an algorithm.
And math is not racist.
Chumhum is very proud of its diversity and openness.
And yet their Safe Filter
deters people from patronizing businesses
in African-American neighborhoods.
Chumhum is not responsible
for the actions of those who respond to its software.
It was Ms. Feldman's choice to open a four-star restaurant
in a marginal neighborhood, not ours.
It isn't a marginal neighborhood,
It's a black neighborhood.
Well, it's both, which really
isn't that uncommon.
Wait, what?!
Well, he's not saying anything that unusual.
Look at crime rates. Look at home values.
And look at the biracial lawyer pimping for a racist system.
Excuse me?! Are you actually saying--?
Let's not make this personal, guys. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hey, wait.
Chumhum will admit no wrongdoing.
But in the spirit of making this world a better place,
Mr. Harman is willing to offer Ms. Feldman $50,000
to open a new restaurant anywhere she wants.
Consider it a gesture.
What gesture is that?
The finger?
Chumhum is worth 300 billion.
I know how much my company is worth, thank you.
Is that because your stock's dropped 22%
since you became COO?
Wow, seriously?
Okay, Cary, you don't need to go there.
Want to fight dirty now?
You know what? You know what?
No, we're done!
Your guy's a piece of work.
Unfortunately for you, the law's on his side.
We'll see.
You're kind of in love with her,
aren't you?
Who?
Alicia.
No.
You just talked about her for the last 30 minutes.
Occupational hazard.
You have to be obsessed with your candidate,
or you're not doing your job.
"Candidate"?
Well, the question is will the voters think
she's still tainted by her scandal?
You're staring at me. I can feel it.
I can't help it.
You are very sexy when you're writing a check.
$50,000?
Convene a focus group.
See if you've resurrected St. Alicia.
But above all else,
I am a mother, and it's as a mother
I am asking for your support, Webster City.
I know ethanol can make a difference for our children.
So please remember, a vote for Florrick
is a vote for family.
Really?
I feel like I'm pandering to housewives.
Anyone who knows me will smell
the bullcrap a mile away.
Yes, but it's Iowa.
All they smell is bullcrap.
Look, these e-mail blasts
aren't meant to be subtle.
They're a sledgehammer.
So don't pull back.
Okay, what's the next city?
Three, two...
Hello, voters
of Sioux Center.
I'm Alicia Florrick.
As the mother of two incredible--
kids... I, um,
love and adore...
Do you need a minute?
Yeah, it just... thanks.
Hey.
What's wrong?
Uh, nothing.
All right, so I have something to say.
Okay.
Now, we agreed that I would stay freelance, right?
Yes.
That's how I keep my fee low.
And part of that
freelance work has taken me
to Lockhart/Agos.
I know.
Well, clearly you have some
hard feelings toward them,
but, Alicia,
I would never use
information gleaned from here--
Oh, no I never thought you would.
But if you have some sort of issue with this arrangement,
then we should talk, because I need to know
whether I can continue working here.
I want you to work here.
Even if freelancing takes me to Lockhart/Agos?
Yes.
Good.
I have something for your motion to dismiss.
Oh, I thought you were gonna say
you were going to Lockhart/Agos for this case.
No.
Unless you want me to.
No. Shut up.
Uh, here.
Thank you.
You're suing Chumhum
for tortious interference
with prospective economic advantage?
Yes, Your Honor, Chumhum's Safe Filter
creates a racist geofencing effect that disadvantages
business owners in African- American neighborhoods.
Your Honor, tortious interference requires
proof of either purposeful or knowing interference.
And there is none here.
We believe there is, Your Honor.
I'd like to call a witness to show
that the intent requirement is not met.
Mr. Harman, is it possible for Chumhum's Safe Filter
to have a racist intent?
No, the filter is powered by two things, and two things only:
objective third party statistics--
uh, crime rates, for example--
and user-generated feedback data.
Like comments and reviews?
Yes, exactly.
Which is entirely in the users' hands.
I mean, there's no way that anyone at Chumhum
could use a Safe Filter
to purposefully interfere with plaintiff's business?
No, not even if we wanted to.
Thank you. Mr. Harman, is it true that Chummy Maps
is only available on cOS-- Chumhum's own operating system?
Yes. This is a recent study done
by the Internet Research Foundation.
Could you read what it says right there?
Uh, "cOS users are 71%...
Caucasian."
And what percentage of cOS users are African-American?
Does it say?
Eleven percent.
And do these numbers match your own market research?
Chumhum is not to blame for socioeconomic disparity.
Our products cost more because they are better products.
So you knew about the disparity between white and black users?
Again, our products are not intentionally
targeted toward Caucasians.
Yes, but if your user-generated feedback data
is being generated predominately by white users,
doesn't it follow that the results will be skewed?
Objection, speculation.
Perhaps.
And yet I'm still curious.
Would the results be skewed?
No.
Really? If you allow
one racial group to dominate a discussion
about what neighborhood is safe, you don't think
the results will be skewed?
Objection!
Asked and answered.
You're right.
I'm just giving him a chance to rethink.
But it seems he doesn't want to.
Withdrawn.
Purposeful or knowing interference
doesn't just mean the defendant knew
his product could have a disparately
racist effect.
It also means...
he should've known.
We lost.
Mr. Harman admits he knew
their data was being generated
primarily by Caucasians,
so an argument can be made
that he should have known
what would result.
Ms. Quinn, Mrs. Florrick,
your motion to dismiss is denied.
Request full discovery, Your Honor.
Your Honor!
Plaintiff is only asking for full discovery
in order to force us to settle.
Poking around all of Chumhum's products
would compromise trade secrets.
But you can't shut them out entirely.
I'm granting the discovery motion
and limiting it to items
related to racist references
and Chummy Maps.
What do you think?
Small.
You don't get claustrophobic in here?
I'm actually starting to like it.
Yeah, Stockholm syndrome.
I meant what do you think about the focus group?
You want to run her for a senate seat?
To start.
Alicia Florrick.
Wife of the Illinois governor?
A woman who stood by her husband during his worst moments.
Housewives-- Republican and Democratic.
And independents.
How large a sampling?
Whatever I can get for $50,000. But we have to have
ironclad waivers. Nobody can know we're doing this.
Especially not Alicia.
Why not Alicia?
Because I'm using it to convince her.
Yup, good old Eli.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
Gina, could you come in here?
Do we need the Cone of Silence?
Alicia and Jason Crouse.
I have no idea what that means.
Jason Crouse. Alicia's investigator.
I know who he is--
Are they having an affair?
No, of course not.
No.
He came by the apartment
while I was filming Alicia's Internet ads
and she touched him.
Touched him where?
His arm.
Like a massage?
No, not like a massage.
Then let it go.
She touched his arm.
People touch each other's arms.
She was smiling at him like a schoolgirl, Eli.
And not just in front of me--
in front of the whole crew.
Eli, I want to be clear here.
They were touching
in front of strangers with cameras.
Okay, let me look into it.
Now, we both know
Peter's campaign wouldn't withstand
the fallout of something like this.
And Alicia's rehabilitation would certainly
become a wasted effort.
Okay, let me handle it.
Oh, Eli, you didn't even know!
I said I'd handle it!
Oh, damn.
Judge Marx has ordered limited discovery,
confined to "Racist references" and "Chummy Maps."
We'll split up Chumhum hard drives
and review all e-mails,
software specs and memorandums.
Mark them as either responsive or nonresponsive.
Uh, how narrowly are we interpreting "responsive"?
Well, don't want to do the opposition any favors.
Well, any disagreements, we'll discuss.
Good. Call me here. And good luck.
What?
March 5 of this year: "Why do we include home ownership rates?"
In reference to...?
There's no subject line,
but it's in a thread about the Safe Filter.
Who to who?
Chummy Map coder Kip O'Neill to his super,
Larry Melanie.
Damn. I think this one's responsive.
But did they include home ownership rates into the algorithm?
No.
So...?
They were considering it.
So? They didn't do it. Mark it as non-responsive.
Come on.
They discussed including home ownership rates
in the design of Safe Filter.
I mean, that would automatically disadvantage poorer neighborhoods.
It's a proxy for race.
Yes, but, again, they didn't,
and so it wasn't.
Well... let's let the judge rule on its relevance.
Anyway, you sure you're not misinterpreting this e-mail?
It says,
"Why do we include home ownership rates?"
H-How else do we interpret that?
Maybe the emphasis is on "We."
"Why do we have to be the ones who have to do this?
Why can't somebody else to do it?"
There's an easy way to find out what he meant.
Apricot thyme granola or rose pistachio pepita?
We rotate every day.
Almond milk? We make our own.
No, thanks. We're good.
So about those home ownership statistics?
Yeah, that was just in beta.
Uh, what was in beta?
Our use of home ownership stats.
To determine which neighborhoods were unsafe?
Yeah,
but only in beta.
See, we had to show users something on day one,
before there was any user feedback,
so we used other data just to start it off.
So what percentage of the results is currently shaped by user feedback?
100%. We realized that
if we kept it completely in the users' hands,
we would avoid another "Animal" incident.
Okay, a what incident?
Just something that happened last year in the imaging department.
We were this close to causing a major you-know-what storm. I'll show you.
Uh, no, no. No, no, no.
I've got my computer...
No, just stop. It's okay. Stop.
Well, we just can't pretend he didn't say something.
No, but he didn't say Chummy Maps.
Um, does this thing that you were about to show us...
The "Animal" incident?
Right.
Does it have to do with Chummy Maps?
No, but we were all worried we were gonna...
Uh-uh, uh-uh. No, no... Don't say anything else, okay?
If it doesn't have to do with the maps,
then we don't have to look at it.
And we really shouldn't look at it.
在这片儿感觉不安全 有人跟踪了我三个
What?
Something in the discovery?
No. The reader comments on Safe Filter.
"Super shady street!" Exclamation point.
"Heard gunshots, never going back!"
Sad face.
You think it's racist? Do you?
He heard gunshots. It's not racist.
My guess is he thought he heard gunshots.
More discovery from Chumhum. We'll take half.
Oh, good. Thank you.
So...
Biff and, um, Skippy are working out well for you?
Yes, they are.
And how is that not reverse racism?
How is what not-- making fun of their names?
Yeah, calling them white stereotyped names.
Is that what Biff and Skippy are?
Country club names from some bad skit somewhere--
polo outfits and tennis racquets-- don't pretend
like you don't know what I'm talking about.
We don't want to be having this conversation.
We already are.
Yes, reverse racism
that dangerous contagion that's taking hold of society.
It doesn't have to be a contagion to be true.
So how is is that not reverse racism?
Because harm is necessary for racism to be... harmful.
But you think they're idiots because they're big white guys?
No, I think they're idiots because you hired them instead of me.
Can I see your laptop?
Why?
Because I want to steal it.
What?
Banner ads.
This one's my Chumhum account.
And this one's yours.
I get...
soul food
and you get...
skiing.
Meaning?
Maybe we can expand the discovery.
Alicia's out.
That's fine.
I'll wait for her.
You doing some work?
Yup.
Mind if I ask you a few questions?
That depends.
On what?
The questions.
Married?
I am not.
Girlfriend? Kids?
I've had girlfriends.
Not had kids.
I have a daughter.
Divorced.
Me, not my daughter.
Sorry for my nosiness.
I just like to know about Alicia
and her life.
No problem.
You know, they're actually paying me now,
so I'm gonna get back to work.
She's getting close to you.
Isn't she?
I think these are questions for Alicia, not for me.
You understand why I ask?
Her husband is running for president.
There's a lot more attention being paid.
I think these are questions for Alicia,
not for me.
Good talking to you.
The ads you're seeing are for things you might like, right?
Things you search for or shop for online.
That's right.
And the ads you see
are different from the ads that I see?
Yes, they are.
Your Honor, the ads are just targeted.
Advertisers tell Chumhum they want to reach people
of a certain age, gender, ethnic background,
and Chumhum obliges.
That's nothing more than retailers wanting to reach their customer base.
Opposing counsel's missing the point, Your Honor.
Am I? Tell me.
The point isn't that white people get white ads
and black people get black ads.
Because you haven't made that point.
The point is the ads that appear on Chummy Maps
extract user data from the entire chumhum product suite--
search engine, e-mails, chat sites,
news feeds, shopping-- all of it.
Chumhum is a fully integrated platform.
Therefore our discovery shouldn't be limited to Chummy Maps alone.
It should include all of Chumhum.
Your Honor, that's a hysterical escalation.
It would be a ridiculous amount of material.
Good thing we can handle it.
To honor your discovery ruling, judge,
we must see everything.
They're right, Mrs. Florrick.
Full discovery of Chumhum is granted.
Who's side is the law on again?
Eli, I just had my ass handed to me in court.
I do not have the bandwidth for any campaign talk.
This is not about campaign talk.
Okay.
I know you want me to ask you
why you are here, then.
But I'm not going to.
Jason is in your office, working.
Seems like a nice guy.
He reminds me of...
Actually, he doesn't remind me of anyone.
Very strong.
Man of few words.
Which is odd because most of the people I deal with who you know...
use a lot of words.
Yes.
I've gotten over words.
How'd you find Jason?
Eli, what?
What?
What are you after? What are you trying to say?
I know your private life is none of my business...
but when it begins to... spill into your public life...
You're telling me,
when I sleep with Jason you'd rather I kept it private?
You're joking... right?
You're making fun of me?
Okay, I think you are making fun of me,
but I still need to be clear.
This is the speech I normally give to the candidate,
but I will adapt it for you.
Lucky me.
Rule number one-- no touching in public.
Ever.
If Jason is on fire, let him burn.
Touching in private-- no such thing.
Nowhere is private anymore.
Clearly.
Rule number two-- if you have to go out together,
make sure there's always a third party present,
preferably female.
Rule number three-- even if you go out in a bigger group,
never, under any circumstances, let it be in a hotel, a bar...
...or a hotel bar.
Eli...
you didn't talk about any of this with Jason, did you?
What?! No.
Okay.
This is the first and last time
we discuss this.
I'm not sleeping with my investigator, but if I were,
this conversation between us could never take place.
I would never let it take place.
Please just tell me you heard me.
No, Eli, I didn't hear you.
I won't hear you.
You can show yourself out.
I'm not sleeping with my investigator, but if I were,
this conversation between us could never take place.
I would never let it take place.
Please just tell me you heard me.
Bad news-- they got full discovery.
Okay.
New ball game.
Yeah, a lot tougher one.
You want a drink?
I'm getting better at it.
No.
But thanks.
Everything okay?
No.
Full discovery.
Oh, right.
Well, maybe we're just on the wrong side of this one.
Maybe.
I'll see you.
The judge has granted full discovery.
Now, this complicates our job, but it doesn't alter it.
We still split up the materials.
We still decide what is responsive and what is not.
Okay, so, go to it.
We have a problem.
Already?
An e-mail to Chumhum customer service.
"Dear Chumhum, your search results suck.
When I type in my name,
It auto-completes to some seriously racist crap."
What seriously racist crap?
When he typed in his name-- Jamal--
the auto-complete offered to finish the sentence
with "Jamal stole my car," or
"Jamal arrest record."
Okay, that's not good.
But it's non-responsive.
Really?
How do you figure?
It's customer based. I mean,
the auto-complete is based on most used search requests,
so, obviously, more people who typed in "Jamal"
were interested in arrest reports than anything else.
So, Chumhum's not racist... its users are?
Well, one could argue that it's racist to override the results.
Okay, we need to deal with the "Animal" incident.
I don't like the sound of that.
Chumhum has photo-identifying software.
It sorts your photos into categories.
Camping trip, Disneyland, graduation.
One of the customers pointed out that it had tagged photos of her friends.
Alicia Florrick was was willing to forgive her husband when he stumbled.
She deserves at least that much understanding.
And they put her on that election board, right?
They wouldn't have done that if she hadn't turned herself around.
The election board, sure.
Is there anything Mrs. Florrick has said
or done that influences your view of her?
Her episode of Mama's Homespun Cooking.
It was so... raw.
Like she's a real person, with crap to deal with.
Oh, this is good.
Yeah.
Eli?
I'll be right back.
Real people who have to overcome real issues in their life.
Show of hands: How many of you would value those qualities
in a political candidate?
I have a mission for you.
A mission? Really?
Sounds very... mission-like.
Actually, it is.
Mr. Agos?
Cary's fine.
Cary. I was checking up on the background
of the coders over at the Chicago Chumhum office.
Which coders?
Kip O'Neill.
The guy who created the Safe Filter.
I went through his on-line postings.
In 2013,
a year before he created the Filter, he got mugged.
He didn't say where, but he said it was a "Sketchy neighborhood."
If he were mugged by...
You can say it.
If he were mugged by African-American people,
it's evidence he was racially motivated in the creation of the filter.
Good. Do we know if he was mugged by African-Americans?
No. I checked for news reports. Nothing.
Okay... that's good work, Brian.
That is pretty good work by Biff,
don't you think?
It's really not my team--
imaging and tagging.
I'll bring Josh over.
Where's Jason? I thought he was meeting us here.
Oh, yeah, he called.
He thought you might want to limit his hours on this?
This is Josh.
He can speak a little more specifically as to, uh... yeah.
Yeah. So... the photo wasn't tagged by a person,
it was tagged by an algorithm.
And the algorithm can't tell the difference
between an African-American woman and an animal?
Well, it can now, but, uh,
three years ago, we hadn't given it enough examples.
It had real trouble with light and shadow.
It got a lot of other stuff wrong, too.
Just nothing else that looked so...
Racist?
Right.
It's gotten better. Google had this problem, too.
Did the algorithm
ever mistake a white person for an animal?
Why would it do that?
Because it mistakes white people for
polar bears or white seals.
No. Not so far.
Why not?
Why does it have trouble
identifying African-Americans,
but not Caucasians?
I guess because we hadn't given it enough examples.
We're not racists.
I'm not saying you are.
I'm just looking around your workplace.
It's clearly responsive.
I disagree.
It's not racist. It's a technical shortcoming.
It's implicit bias.
Look, no one at Chumhum is actually racist.
They just code what they know.
That's why the tagging software
never misidentifies white people as animals.
The software has been corrected.
You yourself said no one there is actually racist.
This is non-responsive. Click it.
He's wrong.
He's also paying our bills,
so, I think we have to click it.
Nora, hi. Eli's not here.
I know. The campaign sent me.
They sent you? Why?
In case you need anything.
Oh. Well, I don't. I'm fine.
Back to the grindstone?
Yeah.
Tough boss.
Cary Agos called. He wants to meet.
Why?
I don't know. Maybe he wants to make a deal.
Okay, give me second.
No, he just asked for me.
I'll call you.
I'll just wait in a corner, in case you need anything.
Nora, I'm fine.
It's okay.
I have a book.
Thanks for coming in, Lucca.
Anything to settle this.
We just found out one of your coders, Kip O'Neill--
he was mugged in 2013.
I wanted to see if you knew about this.
This is why I'm here?
Yes.
He was mugged the year before he created Safe Filter
in what he called "a sketchy neighborhood."
Why call me?
Why not Alicia?
I thought you'd be more helpful.
You're implying the assailants were black?
I'm not implying anything.
I thought you could ask your client.
Next time,
call Alicia, too.
It just seems like something both our sides would need to address
if it turns out to be race-related.
Good-bye.
It wasn't a negotiation.
We might have a problem with Kip O'Neill.
Okay, I got it. Jason's here.
I'll ask him.
Kip O'Neill was mugged in 2013.
It's on his profile page.
We need to find out the race of the culprits.
All right. I'll see what I can do.
Jason, did Eli talk to you
before, when you were here?
Yup.
About us?
What do you mean, "us?"
Us working together.
Yes.
I don't want...
things to be uncomfortable between us.
Me, neither.
Well, then, don't let Eli
make them uncomfortable.
Here's the thing:
I used to have a very different life.
A very...
uncomfortable life.
I didn't like it.
So now, there is nothing I do
that makes me uncomfortable.
Nothing.
Even if I want something...
Is everything all right in here?
Do you need anything?
We're fine, Nora. Thank you.
You said, "Even if you want something..."?
Yeah, you know, that's...
It's okay.
Jason...
Look, I just, I like things simple.
All right? Work simple, home simple, life simple.
And isn't it?
It was.
I have to get back to work.
I'll call you.
How did we go from mugging victim to possible racist?
If the guys who mugged him were black or Latino,
Cary and Diane will say racial bias
was motivation for the Safe Filter.
So cynical.
Here he is.
So?
Good news.
The attackers were white, one was a redhead,
so as long as that hasn't been categorized as a new race...
We dodged a bullet.
What do you get when you cross a black and two Mexicans?
Excuse me?
It's a joke.
Kip e-mailed it to his teammates
four weeks before they launched Chummy Maps.
Which I'm guessing gives Diane
and Cary their bias.
Damn.
I'm not a racist.
And I'm sure some
of your best friends are blacks and Mexicans.
The joke was just me breaking up the drudge work.
Apparently, work around here gets pretty drudgy.
There are dozens of these jokes here.
Then you've seen the white jokes, too.
That... really doesn't help, Kip.
Look... we work a hundred hours a week.
We sleep on the floor here half the nights.
It was a meta joke-- a joke about joking.
Like dead baby jokes.
So they were just a bunch
of immature frat boys blowing off steam.
Pretty much.
But it's gonna be hard
denying any knowledge of racism to Judge Marx.
You're right.
Y... You're finally agreeing with me.
It's been known to happen, Alicia.
Okay...
then I will tag every Chumhum e-mail
with racist jokes "Responsive."
Not just e-mail.
Tag every racist joke on the Internet.
I'm sure a Chumhum search will turn up a billion Web pages.
Just mark all "Responsive."
You're gonna bury the e-mails.
Of course not.
I'm just following the judge's directives.
This is their discovery?
50-terabyte hard drive.
Picture all the contents in the Library of Congress,
and then multiply that by five.
Congratulations-- we've just been hit
with what may be the largest document dump
in American legal history.
Go away. What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be with Alicia!
No, i'm supposed to be working.
That was work.
No, that was
the most embarrassing thing I've ever done, Eli.
And I've done your laundry.
Where are they now?
Eli, they're not shtupping at 11:00 in the morning.
Courtney can't know.
You are a horrible employee.
And you're a monster.
Yeah, uh... okay, yes,
I'll-I'll see what I can do.
Thank you so much.
Everything all right?
Yes.
Can I call you later?
About the PAC?
About the PAC.
Eli.
You rang?
What's this?
A file on Jason.
Skeletons and such.
Show it to Alicia.
No.
It won't work.
You haven't read it.
Alicia doesn't scare.
Not when it comes to men.
All women scare.
Use it.
Here he is again.
What'd you find, Brian?
I've been going through the algorithms.
I thought you were digging through the discovery.
Sometimes it's best to look in the math.
What'd you find?
A patch-- pretty crude, hastily done.
I don't know what that means.
It's embedded in the photo-tagging software
it was altered so the word "Animal"
could never appear in a photo tag.
Why would they do that?
To hide something?
Plaintiff has a motion to compel?
We do.
This, uh, photo shows an African-American woman
who was mistaken by Chumhum's photo-tagging software
and tagged as an "Animal."
Yes, it does.
We discovered this photo when we noticed a patch
in Chumhum's photo-tagging algorithm.
A patch in the software?
So it wouldn't happen again?
Yes, but rather than...
fix the underlying problem,
they simply... patched it to prevent one instance
of the problem from recurring.
Was this included in discovery?
We don't know, Your Honor.
Chumhum's counsel sent us 50 terabytes of discovery,
it will take my firm
six years to work through it.
I see.
Mrs. Florrick...
did you include this photo in discovery?
No, Your Honor.
Were you aware of the photo?
We were, Your Honor,
but we found it nonresponsive.
Really? So you found
50 terabytes of data responsive...
but an African-American woman being mistaken for an animal
didn't make the cut?
We believed it did not.
No, you will provide
all responsive documents to plaintiff's attorneys today,
and you have been found in contempt, ma'am.
Your Honor, this was not my...
You will pay $5,000
to the Clerk of the Circuit Court
by end of day Friday,
as well as any plaintiff's costs and attorney's fees
incurred in pursuing this violation.
And if there are any more games like this,
the sanctions will be doubled. You understand?
I do, Your Honor.
All right, look...
you have any more questions, you ask Alicia, all right?
I'm a guest here.
I don't have a question.
Good.
What's that?
A file on you, from the campaign.
You serious?
I'm not, but the campaign is.
She knows all about my criminal record.
I don't pretend like it doesn't exist.
Take a look at the back page.
Does she know about that?
Why are you investigating Alicia?
It's none of your business.
Actually, that part is.
I was going into business with her.
I wanted to know more about my prospective employer.
I don't believe you.
And I seriously don't give a damn.
This stuff...
this is your life, it's not mine.
Eli...
do not make it mine.
Now, get off my car.
Okay, we're listening.
One, effective 9:00 A.M. this morning,
Josh Shelby's employment at Chumhum was terminated.
The Photo Coder?
Yes.
Two, the Safe Filter has been changed from a default setting
to an opt-in-- users will have to activate it
if they want to know areas to avoid.
And the business icons should not be switched off.
We agree.
Fine.
And how much you offer?
Zero.
We were under the impression
this was a settlement offer.
These are Little Dokebi's
financial records.
The restaurant was struggling.
Ms. Feldman was slashing costs
almost as much as 35%
because business was going soft.
She started doing this two months...
before the Safe Filter went live.
Restaurant business 101, Ms. Feldman--
your business tanked because you skimped on quality.
Mr. Canning...
That's not true.
How did you even get these documents?
Ms. Feldman stored them
on Chumhum's cloud-based spreadsheet service.
Which is private...
Actually,
users authorize Chumhum total access
when they agree to the terms of service.
It was a free service.
Divya probably wanted to save some money.
Mr. Canning...
I have never skimped in my life.
Sorry, but I'm not sure what we can do.
So your client isn't racist-- they're just omnipotent.
Keeping us all safe.
You want to celebrate?
In what manner?
In any manner you desire.
So, is this your place?
Let's go dance.
I don't... I don't really dance.
Too bad.
Screw it.
I'm sorry to bother you so late.
No.
We need to talk about Jason.
No, we don't.
He has a file on you.
What does that mean?
He has a personal file on you.
He has looked into your past.
