As soon as I saw you, I knew there was no need for a DNA test.
Dear Callie, I'm your sister.
Her name's Sophia.
You were way better than her.
She only made the team because she's Latin.
It doesn't even matter whether I'm here or not.
Well, congrats. It doesn't anymore.
Hey, girls, change of plans.
Party at Mariana's tonight.
I know it's not true,
but my dad won't let me sleep over at your house
because he thinks you're gay.
He was brilliant.
Even got into the junior symphony. He got beaten up.
His hand was shattered.
OK, you need to get everybody out of the house now.
How am I supposed to do that, Callie?
Play!
OK, that's why they're all here, isn't it?
*...Winter, summer, fall*
*They're all washed up if you're still way over there*
*Maybe slide on in by my side*
It sucks being the responsible one.
It was worth it, though, getting to hear you play again.
That first song, the only reason they played it was...
I knew they'd love it, and they did.
They are obviously still alive, right?
And if they're having a party,
we'll certainly find out about it soon enough.
All right, everybody. No mercy.
If we haven't used it in the last three years, it goes.
Oh. Hey, Mom, remember this?
Oh, my God!
Here, take this.
What is this?
It's trash, trust me.
Wait! Where are you going with that?
I love that vase.
Hey, hey, no mercy, remember?
For the record, it was a pretty ugly vase.
If Brandon wants to use this as a studio,
Brandon should clean it himself.
I am cleaning it, you're just helping me.
It's not gonna be just Brandon's space.
This is gonna be a hangout space for everybody.
Oh, no, no! No heavy lifting, Mama.
Uh-uh-uh. You sort through these.
Ugh! Geez! Thank you. Thank you.
On second thought, I don't want you getting hantavirus.
Why don't you go sit down and... and be pretty.
Go delegate from over there.
What's that?
Oh, I... I put my family tree together when I was in college.
I traced my mom's lineage all the way back to Africa.
Why?
I don't know.
I guess I was just curious, about my history.
I can't believe we kept all this crap.
You guys are lucky to have all this crap from when you were little.
You know, to remember stuff.
Well, hey, I have the best memento of all.
Oh, look who I found!
"Mikey the Bikey!"
I'm sorry, what did you just call that?
Mikey the Bikey. We all learned how to ride on him.
Don't you think we should keep that, for the baby to learn on?
She's gotta start somewhere.
OK, wait. You just said "She."
It's a girl?
We were not supposed to say anything.
But yes, it is a girl.
Outnumbered! Outnumbered! You're outnumbered!
You're outnumbered! You're outnumbered!
You are outnumbered!
So have you, uh, you talked to Jude yet?
No, I will. I just haven't had a chance.
Ok.
Wow. She looks just like you.
Yeah.
You know, at first, I didn't think I wanted to meet her.
But then I couldn't stop thinking about her.
You know, it's not her fault that her dad...
...my dad... left mom, you know?
It's weird when you say, "your dad."
I know, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
Donald is our dad. OK?
Robert's just some guy I got some DNA from.
What about Sophia?
Well, she is just...
...my half-sister, I guess.
Like I'm your half-brother?
Jude, you are my brother. Period. OK?
If you don't want me to meet Sophia, I won't.
If you want to...
...I think you should.
And you're OK with that?
Hey. I'm sorry about the party.
I shouldn't have said I stood up to my dad when I just snuck out.
I just didn't wanna hurt your feelings.
But, you know,
it wouldn't even matter if I did stand up to my dad,
'cause it's not like I have a say. In anything.
So, uh, when do you think we'll have an answer?
About the new principal, I mean?
Well, the final interviews with the search committee are tomorrow,
so soon, I hope.
Well, you got my vote.
You've been doing a great job since Karina left.
Thank you.
What's up?
Um, I just wanted to let you know that I've hired an attorney
to represent my interests regarding the baby.
I didn't want you to be surprised when he gets in touch.
You're kidding, right?
I think it's best if we let them do the talking from now on.
Let's go!
Hey. What's going on? Did I just see April crying outside?
Oh, probably, yeah.
She's off the team.
She is?
Yeah, it's kinda your fault.
It's what?
I'm kidding.
I mean, mostly. She got completely faded at your party, and...
She wasn't the only one.
She's the only one whose pics are up online,
looking completely trashed.
She broke the code, so she's out.
But Kaitlyn was...
Mariana, don't poke the beast. Seriously.
OK, so listen up. April's out, so we need to fill her spot, ASAP.
Yes?
Um, are we sure we wanna let April go?
I mean, she's one of our best dancers, and honestly,
everyone had a pretty good time the other night.
April's behavior reflected badly on all of us, so she's out.
So we're having an emergency
audition session tomorrow after school,
so spread the word, OK?
Nice crossface.
Thanks.
Relax, Foster, it's cool.
We don't need to make things weird.
So it didn't work out. We can be friends, right?
Teammates?
Right.
Jesus, let's go.
So has your brother said anything about me?
Who, Brandon?
No.
Jesus? Um, no, why?
Well, we... we kinda hooked up at your party,
and he said he was gonna call me and he, like, hasn't.
You hooked up with Hayley?
No! Who said that?
She did. I can't believe
you hooked up with another one of my friends!
What the hell is wrong with you?
I mean, why can't you just date some girl
in Science Club or something. God, Jesus!
Science Club? Really?
Relax. It was a one-time thing.
Oh, it better not be. Hayley really likes you.
She's upset you haven't called.
So you want me to call?
Yeah!
I'm not gonna let you be some douche who, like,
mows through girls faster than Mom's WeedWacker. Call her.
Sisters, right? What a pain.
I really wanna be with you.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pressure you.
No, it's not that. It's just, um...
Having sex is a violation of my parole.
Seriously?
They can do that?
Yeah, they can do a lot of things.
So how long you gonna be on probation again?
Um... you don't have to wait, or anything.
Like, if you wanna...
No, no, I was making a joke.
It's good. I can wait.
I'd wait forever for you.
You know the reason I came back from Indiana
wasn't 'cause I hated it there, right?
I mean, them Hoosiers are some very nice people.
What I hated was being somewhere you weren't.
Because I love you.
It's nice.
Is that a new song?
Uh, no.
I'm just finding an ending to an old one.
So I decided I'm gonna meet my sister.
Uh, half-sister.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you tell Jude?
Mm-hm. He's cool with it.
It's kinda just how he is, though.
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
You're not late.
Hell, I should leave then, come back in an hour.
Hey, Lou.
Hey.
OK. Well, um, I should leave you guys to it. Have fun.
So, what's up there?
What do you mean?
It's pretty obvious you two have a history.
Or maybe a "Present."
Uh, she's my sister.
But you're not related.
You know what?
I hate when people say that.
Adopted siblings are related, OK?
Sorry. She's not adopted.
Callie.
Yet. Right?
Not legally, but we are a family.
I mean, she's just as much my sister as Mariana is.
Ok.
So, what do you want to work on?
How about the song that we did at the party?
What was it called, "Outlaws"?
Uh, it's pretty great.
I thought if we dirtied it up a little bit,
we could add it to the setlist.
Actually, that song isn't really for the band.
Why not?
It's just personal.
You don't think "Ape Man Love Machine" is personal?
Did you, uh, write it for someone special?
No. I... I... I just had other plans for it.
Yeah? Well, I had other plans for the band,
which didn't involve you. But things change.
Wow. Have you heard of this, the "Word Gap?"
So babies who aren't talked to enough
are headed for trouble in school from the get-go.
Like basically your entire ability to learn is wrapped up
in how many words you hear in your first years of life.
Yeah. Makes sense.
But with the two of us for moms,
I don't think our child is gonna have anything to worry about.
What? You talk a lot.
Oh, I do?
Yes, you do.
Although...
you really don't have a lot to say about this Timothy situation.
Honey, I love you, and I hear you,
but I have a really big day tomorrow.
I have to go in front of the school board, which Timothy is on,
and nail my interview, and I just...
I really don't wanna get worked up about
how much his timing just sucks.
And to top of it,
I have to deal with this visit to the Quinns tomorrow.
Well, just use it as an opportunity to suss him out.
Oh, I'm planning to.
I mean, besides stalking her at work,
don't you think giving Callie that letter from Sophia
was a little manipulative?
And why hasn't he signed the abandonment papers?
What's that about?
Lawyers slow everything down,
you know that.
I'm so sick of lawyers.
And Timothy's timing is impeccable, and strategic.
You have something he wants, and he has something you want.
You think he deliberately sicked his attorney on us
the day before my interview?
Look, respectfully, I think we've gotten off track
under Karina's leadership.
If you look in the folders in front of you,
you'll find my academic and financial plan
to re-focus Anchor Beach on our original mission statement:
to educate, cultivate, and motivate well-rounded kids
who are engaged in their community
with a focus on protecting the environment.
That's why we chose this location,
with the most extraordinary laboratory in our backyard:
the Pacific Ocean.
I think it's time to return to our roots,
and to bring Anchor Beach back to greatness.
And I believe that I can provide the leadership to do that.
Thank you, Lena. Nice job.
But how exactly are you planning on
returning the school to greatness
when you've been cutting programs
ever since you took over as interim principal?
I inherited a deficit.
So as vice-principal,
you were unaware of the financial status of the school?
No. I was fully aware that things were tight.
The government cut a few programs last year,
but when we lost the Cerars,
we lost our biggest donors.
Which is why Karina was reluctant to expel their son,
and why she lost her job.
Well, I think you've done a terrific job.
You've made some tough calls,
but I can't find fault with any of your decisions.
Just one last thing. As you've disclosed, you're pregnant?
Yes.
And what's your due date?
And how long are you expecting to be on maternity leave?
Well, I'm fairly certain you didn't ask
any of the male applicants that question, but, um...
OK, Jude.
What's the study of how living things are classified?
Come on, you know this one.
Say the first thing that comes to mind.
OK, who else can answer?
Taxonomy.
That's correct. What makes up the human genome?
Five, six, seven, eight.
Wow. Jenna's really good.
Yeah.
She's Kaitlyn's friend?
Why'd we even have auditions?
I mean, why didn't she make the team last time?
'Cause you were better, duh.
Really?
Good job, Jenna.
Just make sure you punctuate that kick at the end.
So it's really... here.
OK, next group. Let's see what you've got so far.
Is this some sort of quid-pro-quo?
I get your vote as long as we agree to share custody with you?
'Cause that's not gonna happen.
Honestly, Lena, it's nothing like that.
Well, your timing would suggest otherwise.
I'm not bartering with my child.
I'm sorry you think I'm such a horrible person,
but I can tell you I will be 100 percent objective...
Forgive me if I have a hard time taking you at your word.
You volunteered to be our donor.
You said that people like us should have kids,
and you wanted to help, anonymously. And then you...
I read the contract.
Yes.
And you knew what it was going to say.
You agreed that Stef and I should be the parents.
I thought we were friends.
I trusted you because I thought you had integrity.
I do.
No.
People with integrity, they honor their word,
even when it's not convenient,
even when they change their minds.
You can't just say that you have integrity,
you have to act like it.
OK, that's five for Tia,
and one for Jenna?
It wasn't me. I voted for Tia.
You voted for Jenna?
Oh, yeah.
I mean, Tia's totally the best dancer,
but do you really think she's the best dancer for the team?
What do you mean?
I mean, do you think she's really gonna blend in?
That's all I was thinking.
Why wouldn't she? Because she's black?
Oh, my God, no! No, not that. No. I...
I just... maybe she's too good?
And what? She's gonna make the rest of us look bad?
No!
No, I just... I thought 'cause Jenna was Kaitlyn's friend...
We don't vote for our friends,
we vote for the best dancer.
Right.
Well, then I vote for Tia, too.
Great. It unanimous then.
Unanimous.
What?
Nothing.
OK, well, let's all take Tia to coffee.
Get her to know her a little better.
We can't. Mariana and I have plans after school.
Right.
You doing all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. Good.
A little nervous, maybe.
Honestly, I'm not even sure why I agreed to do this.
Curiosity. We all wanna know
what makes us who we are, biologically, you know?
I think that's gotta be one of the hardest things
when you're adopted.
The rest of us, we wanna know something like
why are my knees bad,
or how come I can't sing, we just ask our parents.
And they tell us, "yeah, well,
that's what happens to your knees, and it's only gonna get worse."
Or "none of us Coopers can sing."
And "you really can't do that."
So it's OK. It's OK to wanna know.
What if they don't wanna know me?
Well, they asked you here, didn't they?
You ready? Let's do this.
Hey! So how'd your interview go?
Oh! You know what? There was a tricky moment or two,
but I kinda think I killed it.
Nice! You're totally gonna get it.
What about you?
How was your dance auditions? Did you guys find your girl?
Oh, yeah. We did. You know Tia Stephens?
She's a junior, I think.
Oh, yeah, she seems like a sweet girl.
Yeah, yeah, she is. And, you know, she's black, so that's good.
Why is that good?
Oh, well, just 'cause, you know, diversity and all that.
What do you mean?
Well, don't you, like, have rules about clubs and teams
having to pick some brown kids, too?
You mean like quotas? No.
No, we certainly encourage diversity.
Because when kids from different ethnic and religious
and cultural backgrounds come together
it's been proven that it enriches learning and creativity.
OK, relax, Mom, I'm not part of the search committee.
You don't have to give me the principal speech.
What's going on?
I don't know.
I guess just for the diverse person it just makes them feel
like they got a hand-out or a leg up or something.
Are you feeling that way?
No. No, no.
I just... I don't want Tia to feel that way.
You know, because she's a really good dancer.
OK. Well, you just do your best to make sure she doesn't.
Yeah, I will.
So Hayley's coming over, if that's cool?
Yeah, sure. You guys have fun.
Great.
So you're 16?
Mm-hm.
What sign are you?
Cancer.
What? Me, too!
Wait, when's your birthday? June or July?
It's July 11th.
July 15th!
Oh, my God, that's crazy.
Sophia.
Oh, my gosh. Sorry.
Your mom was a Gemini, right?
Yeah.
More iced tea?
Uh, no, thank you.
Any more caffeine and I'm gonna shake apart.
So how long has Callie been with you and your partner?
Wife, they're married.
That's great.
We had a little marriage equality fundraiser here a couple of years ago.
Oh, that's nice. Thank you.
Um, well, Callie and Jude came to us about...
Um, it was over six months ago.
Little over six months.
That's terrific. You have, what, two, three other kids?
Three other kids.
Were you looking for more kids? Was that the plan?
Uh, no, actually. We weren't.
But, uh, but we fell in love with them.
How did they get placed with you? I'm not...
Well, my...
I was in juvie,
and my case worker thought
that I would do better in a house with no male authority figures.
Why?
Oh, no, Sophia, that's not...
It's OK.
My brother Jude and I were in a foster home with...
With an unfit foster father.
Well, I think it's terrific
that you've taken them in and are adopting them.
Well, Jude and Callie have been an incredible gift to us, all of us.
Um, hey, can I take Callie upstairs?
I wanna show her my room.
Yeah, of course. Sure, honey.
I mean, if she wants to.
Yeah, great.
OK.
So when are you planning on adopting her?
Uh, well, as soon as your husband signs the paperwork.
We're just waiting on him.
You won all these?
Yeah.
I was kinda one of those horse girls for a while.
Not anymore?
No. Not so much.
I mean, I still have my horse,
but I don't get to ride that often.
Why not?
You know, school, activities,
SAT prep, all that stuff.
You're taking SAT prep?
Aren't you a freshman?
Oh, yeah.
But my school, and my family,
think all that stuff is super important. So...
You like horses?
Um... I've never been on one.
Really? Well, let me take you riding sometime.
I mean, it's super fun,
when you're not like competing and trying to win and all that.
But you always were? Competing, I mean?
Yeah.
So, what do you do for fun?
School's fun, I guess.
What about you?
I play guitar,
and I hang out with my boyfriend.
Wait, you have a boyfriend?
What's his name?
Uh, Wyatt.
Is it serious? Do you, like, love him?
I do, actually.
Yeah. Just haven't told him yet.
Why not?
There was someone else that I loved,
not all that long ago.
And just saying those words to Wyatt
makes me feel like I'm, I don't know, betraying him.
I know it's over, so...
Yeah, we should, um...
Yeah, yeah, you should go.
But can we hang out again? Like, soon?
We could go riding, or to a movie, or shopping.
I really love what you have on.
Oh, um, yeah, you, too. That's a cool jacket.
Thanks.
Great. So let's go shopping.
Yeah, I'd like that.
Hey, I want you to meet my dog.
He's seriously, like, the cutest thing ever.
Ok.
I was just so shocked when I found out about Callie.
I guess I needed to see her for myself.
I know it was inappropriate, and I am sorry.
I just couldn't believe Colleen had a baby and never told me.
But then I thought about it, and...
...she was probably afraid of what my family might do.
Like what?
Like try and take the baby from her,
get some kind of custody rights.
They would have done that?
You know, I met Colleen when...
...when I was home from grad school.
And she worked at the beach club that my family belonged to.
And we... we fell in love.
But my family just assumes
anyone who isn't from some money is a gold-digger.
Which, by the way,
are why these abandonment papers are taking so long.
Anyway, we eloped,
thinking we could make a go of it,
but once my parents found out, I...
It got ugly.
I'm ashamed to admit that I...
I couldn't stand up to the pressure from my dad.
I was young, and, uh...
Anyway, I eventually gave in,
and let him have the marriage dissolved.
It is without a doubt the single greatest regret of my life.
I loved Colleen very much,
and if I had any idea that she was pregnant,
I never would've left.
Um, I found them, they were playing with the dog.
But Sophia has a ton of homework, so...
Yeah. Of course. We should get home.
I'll go tell the girls.
I'm sorry. This hasn't been easy on my wife.
I understand.
There's something else I've been thinking about. I, um...
I'd like to set up a college fund for Callie, if that's OK?
Um... well, that's very nice.
I would need to discuss it with my wife,
but that's very generous, thank you.
It's nothing. I'd be honored, really.
I feel like I owe her something.
After all, she is my daughter.
I hope it's OK I told the girls we had plans.
I just, I don't want them all up in my business.
Oh. Yeah, totally.
Jesus should be here soon. I'm glad he called you.
Can I borrow your toothbrush?
Um, sure? It's the purple one right there.
Hey, so, um, something's been bugging me.
Since I got on the team, I overheard Kaitlyn tell Jenna
that it was just because I'm, you know, diverse.
But I was talking to my mom,
and she told me there aren't quotas or anything.
And I know I'm not a better dancer than Jenna.
Truth?
Yes, please.
You maybe had a little advantage because your mom's principal.
Well, she's not yet.
Well, she's gonna be.
And with all the programs and clubs they've been cutting,
we just thought that...
She'd never cut the dance team
if her daughter was on it.
So I'm like an insurance policy.
Great, I'm the Geico Lizard of the dance team.
No, it's not like that.
OK, but so what?
I mean, everyone uses whatever advantages they've got, right?
And you're so much better now,
you could almost make the team anyway.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure you are.
I voted for you.
After all but sabotaging me with those questions?
Especially about my pregnancy.
So that you could address it.
It was on people's minds, and you handled it perfectly.
Everyone was very impressed with your presentation.
If I didn't get this because I'm pregnant, that's illegal.
That's not why. They want new blood.
And the worst part,
the woman who got it isn't even really an educator.
She's corporate.
If it's any consolation, all the teachers fought for you.
And, uh... this is for you.
I'm glad you called.
Me, too.
I mean, I don't hook up with just anybody.
Me neither.
I had my eye on you at the gym.
And I saw you looking at me.
All the guys look at you. You know that, right?
Yeah.
You could have any guy you want.
Well, I want you.
But, um, maybe it's best
if we don't tell anyone about this.
At least not right now. You're great. I...
I just don't wanna deal with a
bunch of gossip and teasing from the dance girls.
And honestly, I'd kinda rather my ex not find out about us yet.
Are you still into him?
No.
What about you? Are you over Emma?
Yeah. Of course.
Hey. I thought Hayley was coming over.
Oh, uh, she's upstairs.
I was just getting us a little Snackeroo.
OK, nothing with too much sugar, OK?
Hey, so you're not gonna be making any more budget cuts, are you?
Like, to dance? 'Cause I'm really into it.
It's really not up to me anymore.
Wait, what? Why not?
I didn't get the principal job.
What? No, I thought you killed it.
I did kill it. But they just decided to go with someone else.
They can't!
Honey, I appreciate you being upset for me,
but it's what it is.
It's not fair.
Well, look on the bright side.
Now the other kids can't get mad at you
because your mom's the one making budget cuts.
Do you think the new principal is gonna be making cuts?
I have no idea.
Oh, could you get that, please?
Sure.
Hey.
Is Jesus home?
Um... no, he isn't. I'm sorry.
Will you tell him I stopped by?
Sure.
The kids told me.
I'm so sorry. They're idiots.
Not the kids, the... the search committee.
I really wanted this.
I know you did, baby. I know.
Did they say why?
New blood.
They think I'm tainted by Karina.
Oh, please.
I know they could never admit this, but
I have to wonder if me being pregnant has something to do with it.
Timothy even asked me about my maternity leave during the interview.
Of course he did, ass that he is.
Maybe not as big an ass as we thought.
He signed the donor agreement.
What? You're kidding! Are you kidding me?
No.
Why? Did he say why?
I don't know. Turns out he has some integrity after all?
I didn't get a chance to ask him.
Well, at least some good news after all, huh?
Yeah.
Maybe it's...
Maybe it's for the best.
You know, I won't be under so much stress
and I can take a longer maternity leave.
The one consolation...
...to losing this job is...
we get to have this beautiful baby.
Which is so much better.
Yes.
So how were the, uh...
how were the Quinns?
Oh! They were, uh, nice enough.
Although I think, uh, Mrs. Quinn is a little freaked out about all of this.
What'd she say?
Nothing.
But why wouldn't she be?
Robert, uh...
Robert wants to set up a college fund for Callie.
Wow! Really?
I just...
I don't know, something about it
makes me feel a little uncomfortable.
You know, would it be a bad thing?
A college fund? No.
No, sorry. Timothy.
Letting him be a part of the baby's life.
Not as a father, but as,
a donor, and a friend.
I just, I saw how Callie was
so taken with Robert and Sophia, and I get it.
Everyone wants to know their history.
And are we really gonna keep that a secret from our child?
As long as he's not asking to be the dad,
isn't a little more love and support a good thing?
Maybe we could find even little room...
...for that. I don't...
I don't know.
What's she like?
She's cool.
Yeah?
Kinda young, maturity wise.
But, um, I like her.
You gonna see her again?
I am, yeah.
We have plans to go horseback riding, I think.
So listen, um, is it cool if the band starts playing "Outlaws?"
It's just, Lou really digs the song,
and so do the guys...
Brandon, it's not up to me.
You wrote it.
Yeah, I know.
But I wrote it for you.
I know it sounds stupid, but...
I don't know, I felt like I was...
Betraying something?
Yeah.
Let Lou have the song.
You called?
Yeah, thanks for coming.
I didn't...
I didn't wanna say this over the phone.
I love you, too.
Callie, come here a second.
Uh, yeah?
Um, when's the last time you spoke to Jude?
Um, I don't know, this morning, I think.
More specifically, when was the last time he spoke to you?
So I, um, I got a call from Barbara, your science teacher.
She said that you refused to speak in class today.
Did something happen?
Is everything OK?
Jude, what's going on?
Jude, talk to me.
