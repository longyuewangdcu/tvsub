"Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right"
Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
Emergency rooms are kept in business
by people who've learned that lesson the hard way...
You made waffles in our kitchen.
No, not me --
Your sister, in between weepy phone calls with the fiancé.
Skydivers, bull riders --
people whose bold ideas can often result
in broken bones and smushed spleens.
Well, being away from home is hard.
I've been in D.C. for so long. I know how she feels.
You're the one who brought her here.
She doesn't need your sympathy.
She needs you to send her home.
Now, did she say that?
I'm sure she's telling James all about
how we're holding her hostage.
Well, we can negotiate the terms of her release
when I get home later tonight.
Tonight?
You and I have a surgery scheduled this afternoon together.
Another meeting popped up.
I'm gonna have Amy cover for me.
MM!
Sorry.
No. Not you. The waffles are amazing.
I'm gonna miss having a hostage.
Surgeons are trained to deal with the fallout of bold ideas.
We pick up the pieces
and do our best to fit them back together.
Guys, Jo's dying.
They're stress hives.
I've been a mess since I heard Hunt and Webber
talk about firing one of us.
You're a mess? I've gained eight pounds this week.
You could stop eating.
Where do you even get these at 7:00 a.m.?
Drop it before I drop you.
You know who's not getting fired? Me.
I'm gonna keep my head down and stay out of trouble.
No, we should be impressing them,
showing them they need us.
Wait. I'm confused.
Should I keep my head down, or should I put on a show?
You just need to go one week
without having a nervous breakdown.
Why does everything keep coming back to that?
It happened once!
Relax. Hey, I'm the one who's in trouble.
Last one in, first one out.
Oh, please.
Even if you weren't Dr. Bailey's husband,
you're still Webber's favorite.
Okay, I need two of you for rounds.
Warren, Murphy, let's go.
Nice knowing you.
Braden Morris' alc and t-cell counts are fantastic.
Do you think it might actually be time
for the boy to come out of the bubble?
It would appear so.
So why do you look like I just punched a kitten?
We can't send him home until I tell his parents
the truth about how I treated him.
And before I do that, I need to inform the board.
Yang.
MM?
I gave a patient a stem-cell transplant
using deactivated H.I.V. as a viral vector
in order to cure his SCID.
I did so against his parents' wishes.
Whoa.
Did it work?
Damn right, it did.
Up top! Hey!
I've just informed the board.
Now, let's go see his folks.
Ooh, look at this cute, little fetus.
I want to send this to my mom.
Of course, right after the first trimester --
Two more weeks.
Come on, that's far.
Look, if we start telling people, we got to tell my mom.
She already tried to torpedo our relationship once
over a hypothetical child.
What do you think she's gonna do with a real one?
Oh. Hey, guys.
Hey. Hi! Hey!
Just, uh, having a checkup with old ob-gyn,
making sure all the parts are...in order.
Yeah.
Both of you?
Callie Torres?
Hi. Yes. That's me.
Uh, I think I can handle this on my own.
Okay.
That was terrible!
And what's up with this?
I don't know!
The, uh, first candidate's here
and waiting in the conference room.
Mm. I'm on my way now.
So, I still can't believe
he's making you pick your replacement.
I'm interviewing Dr. Russell's replacement, not mine --
Which I volunteered to do, by the way.
It's a punishment.
It's like making you clean the apartment you're vacating.
No, Owen knows this is the right move for me.
He's been nothing but supportive.
Mnh-mnh.
Something's coming. I can feel it in my bones.
Ew.
I hate his face.
Okay, now look me in the eye
and tell me this isn't a punishment.
Thank you for this waffle.
All right, Ms. Campbell.
I'm just gonna grab you some gauze and --
Non-adherent gauze, Dr. Kepner.
Do you prefer tape or coban?
Where did you come from?
Oh, just trying to be useful, proactive.
Finding needs and filling them --
That's my business.
30-year-old male, motorcycle versus S.U.V.
Complex scalp lac and bilateral hip dislocations.
Vitals are stable.
Wilson, you want to be useful?
Yeah.
Take him to trauma one.
Start the ABCs, get him off the board,
and get him his trauma x-rays.
And I will join you as soon as I finish up
with Ms. Campbell over there.
Absolutely. Of course, Dr. Kepner.
Thank you for the opportunity.
You're welcome!
I don't believe it.
We can take him home?
Absolutely.
Oh!
This is just -- this is just wonderful.
Thank you, Dr. Bailey.
Thank you so much for hearing us
and just letting him get better on his own.
Uh, Mr. Morris...
Braden did not get better on his own.
What do you mean?
I gave him the treatment.
They did not react as I had hoped they would.
Legal action never crossed your mind?
I had hoped that they would see the bigger picture.
Uh, Dr. Edwards should be excused.
She wasn't involved.
Did she know what you were doing
and fail to report it?
She was involved.
Okay, um...
I'm gonna get someone on the phone from legal,
and till I come back, don't go anywhere.
Don't speak to anyone. Don't move.
Okay.
Parents authorized your treatment with signed consent.
Yes.
Then they told Dr. Edwards that they changed their mind.
Yes.
Dr. Edwards informed you, Dr. Bailey,
of the parents' withdrawal of consent.
Yes.
Yes.
And then you gave the patient
the stem-cell transplant anyway.
Have you told anyone else about this?
I informed Dr. Yang this morning
as a representative of the board.
What did she say?
She gave me a high-five.
And did you apologize?
To Dr. Yang?
To the parents.
An apology could go a long way in circumstances like this.
An apology is only effective
when a mistake's been made.
I chose not to honor their wishes.
It wasn't a mistake.
All right, Dr. Ross.
Tell us what's so special about little Jacob here.
Jacob has an omphalocele.
He was born with his abdominal organs outside of his body.
We've been managing him with
daily application of silver-sulfadiazine ointment
as a bridge to delayed closure.
And that's your job.
And to keep an eye on the other tiny humans.
It should be a quiet and adorable day.
Look at you, all grown up.
How's the private sector?
Oh, couldn't be better.
I, uh, just came by to check on my inguinal-hernia kid.
Oh. Oh, great. Well, don't be a stranger.
Yeah, you too.
Hey, Ross, hold up.
I'm not gonna hit you.
I just, uh, want you to check up on an old patient of mine --
Kevin Platt, short-gut kid.
Did he get his S.T.E.P. procedure yet?
Robbins has it scheduled for wednesday.
He's here for TPN till then.
Cool. Got it.
That's my tablet.
Monica Zarr, 27, in remission from rectal cancer.
Okay.
Uh, Monica now suffers from poor sphincter control
due to her low anterior resection.
She's here today for the implantation
of the permanent rectal pacemaker.
Gosh, when you say it, it sounds so sexy.
Sorry.
Honey, there's no need to apologize.
They're doctors.
Um, Monica, I asked you to keep records
of your movements after your last surgery.
Right. The log log.
Paul, give him the poop diary.
Sure.
Every 4 hours and 26 minutes.
The sacral-nerve-stimulator lead we implanted
should have cut your frequencies down far below this.
I'm sorry. I'm gonna recommend
that we not implant the permanent pacemaker.
In fact, I think we should use the O.R. time
to remove the lead wire.
But I'm pooping way less.
But it's not enough to consider the device effective.
We should explore some other options.
Such as?
Antidiarrheals, high-fiber diet, smaller meals.
I'm a professional dancer.
My diet's pretty much leaves and twigs already.
There has to be something else.
Sweetie, we made it through your cancer.
We'll make it through this.
I am so sorry. I couldn't help it.
But also, she farted like 80 times, and I did not laugh once.
No, you just belched to rattle the windows.
And Dr. Warren did neither,
So he's gonna take the lead on the lap chole.
You prep Monica for surgery.
Yes, sir.
And take an antacid before you go back in there.
No, you need to bend the knee first.
Did you get those x-rays, Wilson?
Think I'd be in here if she hadn't?
Well, somebody's sure a grumpus today.
Wilson, fill me in.
Hey, what the hell?
I'll be with you in two shakes of a lamb's tail, Dr. Torres.
Vitals have been stable. Trauma lab's done.
Primary survey revealed a large, briskly bleeding scalp lac.
I put a pressure dressing on for you to assess.
C.T. negative for abdominal or intracranial hemorrhage,
but did show bilateral hip dislocations,
one anterior and one posterior,
with an etabular wall fracture, but both have been reduced.
Wilson, this traction pin's not gonna place itself. Let's go.
Oh, yes. Sure. Of course.
Such a grumpus!
Do you see this pin, Kepner?
You call me that nonsense word one more time,
you won't like where I stick it.
So, you'll access the spine through the retroperitoneum,
and I will perform the fusion with bone graft between l5 and s1.
Do you need to take that?
Nope.
So, Derek usually does the --
You can take the call. It's okay. It's fine.
I'm sorry.
Just because Derek and I
are having a hard time juggling our lives,
that doesn't mean that we should keep you from yours.
You know what? I liked you a lot better
when you were the sister-in-law who didn't give a crap.
Could we just go back to that? That would be great.
Am I qualified to run the department?
Yikes. You know, not my call.
What I do know is that for some strange reason,
since I was a resident, I keep getting thrown the riskiest,
high-profile cardiothoracic surgeries.
I mean, why me, you know?
So, you did your fellowship
in Philadelphia under Jack Alexander?
Oh, do you know Dr. Alexander?
Oh, such a great guy. Really, sweet as pie.
Which is why it was always a little embarrassing
when our chief of surgery would come to me for consults
instead of Dr. Alexander.
I took it as a compliment, but still, awkward.
Knock, knock.
Who's there?
Interrupting jellyfish.
Interrupting je--
Ohh! That's my favorite one!
Hey, Dr. Ross.
Kevin doesn't need the T.P.N. this afternoon.
Dr. Karev said he could do his surgery today.
Oh, that's -- but Dr. Robbins.
Ross, let me explain short-bowel syndrome to you.
Kevin here is missing a big chunk of his small bowel,
which means he needs surgery to lengthen it.
The sooner we operate, the sooner he goes home.
Sound good to you? - Yeah.
We just need to transfer you onto my service.
Dr. Ross will pick up the paperwork for you.
Hey, I should let Dr. Robbins know.
He's my patient.
Or he will be, as soon as they sign the transfer papers.
I don't feel good about this.
You got two choices.
You can feel good about it and scrub in with me,
or you can rat me out to Robbins
and I tell her you didn't check placement
of some kid's feeding tube
and he nearly died from aspiration pneumonia.
But that's not true.
Yeah, but I worked with her for years.
You went nuts and killed my dad.
Who's she gonna believe?
You've already been the head of your own department
for two years.
You think I look too young.
I finished high school early.
Also med school.
It's pretty annoying, right?
Yeah, it's pretty annoying.
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.
Can I borrow Dr. Yang for a moment?
Excuse me.
Hope you saved the big guns for last.
They're all solid candidates on paper,
but between the humble-bragger
and the girl who rode in on the big wheel --
Cristina, I need to know
exactly what Bailey said to you this morning.
About?
Her patient -- the deactivated H.I.V.
Drawing a blank.
Really?
Well, I've been interviewing all day.
I'm surprised I remember my own name.
You know what? It's probably for the best.
Oh, and... go easy on these guys.
You know, they can't all be you.
Dr. Avery, I haven't held my son in months,
and I want him to come out, but for all we know,
she could be making up numbers to cover her own ass.
Yeah, we can't trust that it's safe.
I mean, what if we get him home and something happens?
You know what? I understand your concerns.
What I'm saying is if the labs show --
Are you a parent, Dr. Avery?
My, um -- my wife and I are, uh, expecting.
Well, if someone did this to you, your child,
how would you react?
I'll go ahead and run some new labs for you myself.
All right, that might be enough weight.
All right. Ready for that X-ray?
Right away.
Whoops! Looks like I need more irrigation.
Uh, Wilson, can you take over?
Yes, absolutely, Dr. Kepner.
"Absolutely Dr. Kepner."
Who are you? I thought you had grit.
I do! I do have grit!
Okay, well, all I see is some "Yes, ma'am, no, ma'am" sissy girl,
and there's no place in ortho for sissy girls.
Do you hear me?
Check yourself before you wreck yourself.
Sweetie, look.
This says yoga might help. You love yoga.
Are you crazy? I can't do downward dog.
In a hot room?
A bunch of yoga won't get me my job back.
You lost your job over this?
They can't fire you over something you can't control.
After the cancer,
I was supposed to have my big return to the stage.
I was able to make it through rehearsals,
running back and forth to the bathroom,
But then, the first full run-through,
no breaks...
Oh, no.
...blastoff, in the middle of a pirouette.
The fact that it didn't happen in front of an audience
is the only thing that kept me from shooting myself in the face.
She's exaggerating.
Paul, it was like frickin' spin art.
Hey, where's Kevin Platt?
Dr. Karev took him up to surgery.
Hey, what, are you poaching patients now?
I didn't poach anything.
You stole my short-gut kid.
All right.
Up until a few weeks ago, he was our short-gut kid.
Look, his parents know me. They're fine with this.
Consents are signed, and he's just about...prepped.
Ross?
Really?
The kid's on the operating table.
What do you want me to do?
This was a jerk-ass move, Karev,
and you know it.
So, no one's qualified?
No, I mean, they're all qualified...
But Owen's right.
I need to accept that none of them are gonna be me.
That's his plan.
What's his plan?
Owen. Didn't make sense before.
A fellow interviewing potential department heads,
showing you a bunch of people you won't like
to get you to stay. He wants to offer you the job.
Mer, you -- you're thinking about this way too hard.
You don't offer a first-year attending
head of cardiothoracic surgery. It's just not done.
You just got hired to run an entire research facility.
You're perfect for the job.
Wait, two seconds ago,
I wasn't qualified to interview the candidates,
and now you're saying that I'm perfect for the job?
Yeah, because you're you.
Okay, I'm lost.
Is Owen the one plotting to keep me here, or are you?
Now you're the one thinking about it too hard.
She's a dancer. This isn't just a job.
This is who she is.
And we're just gonna send her home
farting and pooping uncontrollably
for the rest of her life?
And we're done with the chili.
Webber told you to take an antacid.
I did!
I drank half a bottle, and it didn't do anything,
and then I got all anxious about that,
and the next thing you know, I'm on the train to pizza town.
You know what you need? A magnetic esophageal sphincter.
Bailey put one in an old lady last week --
A ring of little magnets
at the end of the esophagus, just above the stomach.
Lets food in, stays closed so you don't keep...
...doing that.
Yes. Yes.
P-please get that thing.
It's a magnetic sphincter?
Yeah.
So, if it closes the opening for the food on the way in,
wouldn't it work on the way out?
What, for our cancer dancer?
It's actually pretty good.
Yeah. You should pitch it to Webber.
Hey, Edwards, um, you've been working with bailey, right?
She was supposed to meet me for lunch,
but she hasn't returned any of my calls. Something up?
What the hell's the matter with you?
How could you be so reckless? - Whoa, how did you --
I had to hear it from Edwards!
I sure as hell didn't hear it from you!
I couldn't tell you.
I didn't want you to have to lie for me.
Dr. Warren, I'd appreciate it if you stepped outside.
Look, she is my wife.
Okay, um...
The lawyers are meeting now.
We're discharging Braden soon,
but it does not look like the Morrises are gonna let this go.
So it looks like a malpractice suit?
Worse.
Assault and battery charges.
Tuck's soccer practice is gonna be over soon.
I was supposed to pick him up. Can you?
There's nothing you can do for me here.
Braden's coming out of the bubble?
Yeah.
I wish I could have seen that.
Suction, please.
You can go, Ross. I've got it from here.
Come on. We're in the middle of a surgery here.
I know. You stole my patient, but you can't steal Ross.
He works for us. He's my resource,
and I need him in the NICU doing what he was told to do.
You need an assist? You've got one.
How can I be of help to you?
Sorry, I'm having a little bit of trouble
dividing these branching vessels.
I can retract the iliac vein medially
to help with exposure.
Thanks.
Derek's coming home tonight.
Yep.
Which means you can go home.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
You were just trying to be nice, and I bit your head off.
I will be out of your hair first thing tomorrow.
Oh, that? No. This is not about that.
I've already forgotten you said that.
So, this isn't you kicking me out for being a bitch?
No. No, we love having you here,
but we don't want to keep you from your life
any more than we have to, so...
What's so funny?
N-- I'm sorry. It's just...
If I had spoken to anyone at Seaside Wellness
the way I spoke to you, I-I would have to have
a conversation for six hours about it.
I love it here.
James and I have not been fighting
about the fact that I'm still here.
We have been fighting
about the fact that I never want to leave.
So, you want to give me a bionic butthole?
It's magnetic.
Yeah, it was Dr. Murphy's idea.
Well, it's commonly used as the esophageal sphincter
to reduce reflux and prevent food from coming back up the throat,
but we think, with a bit of modification,
that it might work just as well for your stool.
Have you done this before?
No, but, uh, it wouldn't be the first time
that a medical device was adapted to something
other than its original intention.
But, uh, we're willing to give it a shot if you are.
W-what do you think, honey?
Yes. Please.
Thank you.
Oh, my god. Thank you.
Paul, you okay?
I am ecstatic.
My heart broke when Dr. Webber said the pacemaker wouldn't work,
but now you can have a normal life.
I mean, you can be comfortable.
This can all end here.
Baby, I love you so much,
and, I mean, that cancer was one thing,
but I don't know how much more of this I could take.
I-I-I -- the smell -- - Okay, yeah.
We'll take one magnetic butthole, please.
20 pounds. Let's see if it's fully reduced this time.
All right, you ready to shoot?
Uh, wait. I'm almost finished.
Okay, well, I need to make sure that his hip
isn't grinding on broken bone pieces.
Yeah. Hold o-- just give me a second.
Just put on a lead apron!
Please give me a second!
Kepner. Dr. Kepner, put on the damn apron!
Torres, I can't be in here
while you do the x-ray.
Um...Wilson, take over for Dr. Kepner.
God, you're so weird today.
I'm sorry. I -- - Shut it.
Just shut it.
I'm telling you, kid, this is the place to be.
It's quiet.
The company's great.
You and me, we got a lot in common.
My intestines are on the inside, but still,
I know what it's like to feel exposed.
If we stick together,
I think we'll be okay.
In fact...
What the hell, man! I thought we were friends!
His omphalocele's ruptured!
Get me saline, sterile dressings,
and Vicryl Mesh, now!
Reload stapler.
You're not gonna oversew the staple lines?
Staples alone should do it.
Hmm. You don't want to take the time?
I mean, I would, but, you know, I don't like leaks, so...
This isn't my first S.T.E.P. procedure.
Oh, I know. I taught you how to do your first S.T.E.P. procedure,
which is why it blows my mind that you would try and poach my patient.
Why are you making such a big deal?
Because it's freaking rude, Alex,
and I don't deserve to be treated like that.
I taught you better than this. You're out in the world now...
...but what you do reflects on me,
And I do not approve of this, and neither will Lebackes.
So, what, you're gonna tattle on me?
Dr. Robbins, you're needed in NICU. 911.
And I spearheaded a hybrid O.R. that offered more flexibility
between non-invasive and invasive techniques --
Gamma cameras, the whole works.
I definitely want to bring that here.
Wow, impressive.
Uh, well, do you have any questions for me?
One.
There's a rumor that working here
means giving up hope of ever winning the Harper Avery.
Oh. That's...
That would make a difference for you?
Of course it would.
I mean, it's the goal, right?
I assume it's why you're leaving.
No.
You'll probably never win a Harper Avery.
I've known people who have deserved Harper Averys,
and people who have won them,
and the thing they all have in common was
the work.
They are focused on the work and the patient,
on making someone better or someone whole
or someone live.
That's their goal.
So...no.
I mean, you, specifically,
will never win a Harper Avery.
Not if that's what you're after.
Uh... so, that's --
You know, I wouldn't give this
place another thought. You'd be a terrible fit.
I don't know what happened.
It burst, Ross. That's what happened. Move.
Fran, get me a larger Vicryl Mesh. I need to protect his organs.
Can I do anything?
You can step outside.
Go.
We ran the labs twice,
and his immune-system values are within the normal range.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Okay.
Come on.
Oh, baby!
She went about it the wrong way,
but Bailey's treatment did work.
A-a-are you looking for a "Thank you," Dr. Hunt?
She's lucky he's alive,
because we're only gonna take her license.
When we're done, she won't practice medicine ever again.
And if we lost him,
I wouldn't stop until she was behind bars. I --
It wasn't Dr. Bailey's fault.
She didn't do anything wrong.
It's my fault he got the treatment.
It's mine.
I-I forgot to tell her you wanted to
withdraw consent, so she just went ahead,
And when I told her the truth, she covered for me.
It was a mistake.
You forgot?!
You just...forgot?!
Hold on. David, please.
Look, Dr. Edwards is a resident, a trainee...
And if you want to yell at someone, then --
In what world does that make it okay?
My son could have died,
and you're just gonna stand there and tell me that
It's okay because it would have been a mistake?!
David.
Wha--
Honey.
David, come here.
Come here.
Sit down.
David, he's alive,
And he's healthy, and we can take him home.
Maybe -- maybe we should just go home, hm?
Can we, dad? Can we go home?
Okay.
You're gonna want to position the ring in apposition
at the level of the anorectal junction.
Good. Uh, careful.
Okay, once it's aligned,
We'll use the attached sutures to tie the ends together.
Like this?
N-no.
Now, you need to provide passive reinforcement to the canal.
That's better.
Now, don't add tension when you throw your knots.
When it's connected,
we will confirm placement with the fluoro.
How far along are you?
10 weeks, today.
I know it's still early.
We're not really supposed to be telling anyone, but...
But we're happy about it?
Yeah.
Yeah, we are. We're really...
Really happy.
Oh, hey.
Thanks.
Oh, those -- those tears aren't --
aren't for me, are they?
There's a reason you were such a grumpus today?
That is not a word!
Sorry. I know.
My mom says it.
It sounds so stupid that once you hear it,
it's hard to stay angry.
Note to self -- does not work on Callie.
We're trying to have another baby...
And, uh, I had an appointment this morning,
You know, just to get the lay of the land.
But, uh, I guess since the car accident,
I've developed all these adhesions,
and so I can't carry another baby.
Callie, I'm so sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
Wilson, we need to put a bell on you.
I owe you both an apology for snapping.
We overed that one of the residents
isn't coming back next year,
and I've just been so afraid that it might be me.
Could be.
Totally possible.
It's not that James isn't amazing. He is.
I mean, he really helped me through something.
But I'm through it now, you know?
I mean, I'm on the other side, you know?
And now, when I stop and look around, I just --
I don't think I need him anymore,
which is terrible, right?
I-I-I don't know.
When we're done here,
I am gonna go and meet with our patient's family,
and then I'm gonna go home and bake a cake with your kids
and read them a really long bedtime story.
And then, when I have absolutely no more ways of avoiding
breaking the heart of this man who deserves better,
I'm gonna call James,
and I'm gonna tell him that I love him...
But I can't do this anymore.
She's lying!
Bailey, that is enough.
I understand you wanting to protect our residents,
but you should not have let it go this far.
Well, you're taking her word over mine!
It is over, Bailey.
The Morrises have agreed to drop the charges
in exchange for Edwards receiving
one week's disciplinary suspension.
They have gone home.
You should both do the same.
What the hell is wrong with you?!
If you got fired over this,
no one would benefit from this treatment
the way Braden did.
You were gonna go down for this, Dr. Bailey.
You knew it could happen, but you were willing
to risk everything to save that little boy.
What kind of surgeon would
I be if I wasn't willing to do the same?
Plus, there's a chance I won't even be here next year,
so I was just rolling the dice.
I was looking at the bigger picture.
You're not going anywhere without a fight from me.
If it's all right with you, sir,
I'd like to stay on Monica's case.
I want to be there when she comes back for a follow-up.
Come over here.
Let's... let's have a seat.
That was a good move today, Murphy.
You're very bright, and you have what it takes
to be a very good doctor.
But you're not a surgeon.
What?
Standing next to you in surgery today only confirmed it.
You make five moves
where a second-year resident should make two.
Your knots aren't square.
You can't see the planes of dissection.
Next year, you'd only fall farther behind.
N-- I-I can work harder.
I can -- I can do better.
A surgical residency
just isn't the right fit for you.
Is...
Is this because I filed that harassment complaint?
No, Murphy. No.
Letting you go isn't a punishment.
It's a kindness.
And you deserve every opportunity
to figure out what your next steps might be.
In the meantime, Dr. Miller
at the University of Washington runs a research lab,
and I think you would do very well there.
She owes me a favor.
I'd be more than happy to make a phone call.
Thank you, sir.
So, observe him carefully overnight,
and in a few weeks, we'll do a double-thickness skin graft.
Okay.
What, did you come to steal more babies?
Don't tell Lebackes.
Oh, god. That makes it worse.
You-- get out.
Look, I'm sorry.
I screwed up.
Kind of...
I'm drowning over there.
Here, cases come in all the time.
I can prove myself.
Over there, if you're not bringing in the cases,
you're not bringing in the money, and you're a nobody.
I don't want to lose this gig.
I didn't know what else to do.
I'm in trouble, and I need help.
What do you mean?
When something like this happens,
you call me, and you say,
"Arizona, I'm in trouble, and I need help."
And I help you.
Do you understand?
Right.
I couldn't tell you.
So you said.
I -- I need to know.
This risk, w-was it absolutely necessary?
He was dying.
And I created something out of thin air.
I took a virus that kills
into something that heals,
and I saved his life.
I saved his life.
*For I toss and turn*
*I can't sleep at night*
*Once I ran to you*
*I ran*
*Now I run from you*
*This tainted love...*
You know, I've thought about it,
And if you want to send the ultrasound to your mom,
that wouldn't be the worst thing.
You've told! I d-- - I-I kind of --
Who did you tell?
Stephanie?
So, after all the crap you gave me this morning,
you went and told your ex-girlfriend?
It was an accident, okay? I'm sorry.
I forgive you.
Thanks.
Still don't know how we're gonna tell my mom.
What do you mean, "We"?
That is all you, Talkie Tina.
第五季第六集中一个会说怪话并且杀死男主人公的洋娃娃
How are your hives?
Oh, my back looks like
a political map of the United States --
big mess of red down the middle, plus Alaska.
Bad day?
Bad day.
Did you pop a baby? I popped a baby.
I don't even know what that could mean.
And do not elaborate.
You guys are gonna be fine.
That's easy for you to say.
Your big victory in the O.R. -- you're fine.
One of us is definitely going down.
Come on, let's go drink about it.
You really think I'm gonna be okay?
I really do.
Go, go, go. I'll meet you there.
Well, I -- I could do it.
No.
I could.
I could carry the baby.
I won't ask you to.
But I'm offering.
Because we want this.
I want this.
And I can do it.
We just got good again.
Now we're too fragile.
And something like this --
if it goes badly, we won't make it.
I'm not gonna put us in that position.
Okay.
Okay.
We have a beautiful life.
We have a beautiful daughter.
And that can be enough, right?
Yes.
That can be enough.
I love you, Calliope.
I love you, too.
How'd it go? Do we have a new head of cardio?
Ugh, I don't know.
I did screen all these applicants before they came to you.
They couldn't have been all that bad.
No, they're mostly fine.
No, not fine. Good.
Any one of them could do the job.
Except humble-bragger.
What?
The Harper Avery Foundation's been looking for ways
to mend fences with us
after what happened to you.
A large cash infusion into our cardio department
could allow us to attract a higher-caliber of talent,
and then -- - Owen, don't.
The worst they can do could allow us say no to
Please don't -- - higher-caliber of talent,
Please don't offer me this job.
I wanted to...
for a week.
But I know you have to go.
And I know nothing good
can come of me asking you to stay.
So I'm not.
And I won't.
Thank you.
But I will ask you something else.
What?
Owen...
Just until you go.
Don't leave me until you're leaving me.
Just until you go.
Hey, stranger!
What are you drinking?
You know what? Doesn't matter. You can dump it out.
This is better.
Champagne is perfect, because...
I was wrong about the Amelia situation.
She doesn't want to leave. She wants to stay.
She can take over your service.
She can help out with the kids.
You can brain map to your heart's content.
I don't have to pull my hair out.
It is the answer we've been looking for.
This is great!
It is, right?
Amy can move to Seattle, and we can move to D.C.
That wasn't the point of my story.
I met him, Meredith.
I met the president.
He came to us.
We walked him through everything we've been working on.
And then, at the end of it, he said that
he wanted to make this a weekly thing.
They offered me a position at the N.I.H.
It's the job.
I'll be right there, on the ground,
doing the actual brain-mapping work myself.
They've given me everything.
Well, we can't just... pack up
and move across the country.
They have promised to have an attending position
waiting for you at James Madison Hospital.
The thing about the bold moves...
they're terrifying.
Could end in nothing but tears and broken bones.
If Amy wants to move to Seattle,
she can take over my practice
without me hovering over her, and she will thrive.
Alex is leaving, Cristina's moving on.
They're -- they all have their next step.
This could be our next step.
This should be our next step.
