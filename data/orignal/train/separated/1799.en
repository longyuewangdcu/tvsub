I had a bad night and I cried like a girl.
I'm over it. You need to get over it, too.
I'm retaking my intern test.
You and I are more than just roommates.
Yeah, we're friends. I mean, right now, you're probably
one of my best friends.
Best friends.
You're the only woman I've ever kissed.
So you're freaking out, too?
A lot of therapy time.
Well, Derek's moved in. And we've taken it to the next level.
I am happy.
In 6500 B.C.,
some guy looked at his sick friend and said,
"I have an idea. Why don't I drill a hole in your skull?
It'll make you feel better."
And thus, surgery was born.
Uh, where's Mer?
She's not here.
So you're just in there by yourself?
I'm not... I'm...I'm waiting for her.
Oh. Love the outfit.
What do you want?
I need cash.
I ordered a pizza, and Alex owes me 20 bucks,
but he's not speaking to me because I saw him crying
over his crazy girlfriend.
And there was a minute a week ago
that I actually thought he was gonna be a human being,
And now he won't open the door.
Run into the bathroom. Just go. Go!
Karev.
Give me a $20.
That was so awesome. You're pretty cool.
Not that I didn't think you were cool before,
But, you know, I did not.
I kinda just thought you were all hair and, you know. Ah.
Now, cool. You want to share some pizza?
It takes a certain brand of crazy
to come up with an idea like drilling into somebody's skull.
But surgeons have always been a confident bunch.
Unh-Unh-Unh. Your clothes, your room.
The living room will not be a dumping ground
like the old place was.
Did you not hear her?
Okay. She kinda scares me.
'Cause she's scary.
Callie needs a new best friend.
Not bad, right?
It's great.
We usually know what we're doing,
And when we don't, we still act like we do.
We walk boldly into undiscovered country,
Plant a flag and start ordering people around.
Do you want to go on a date with me?
It's invigorating and terrifying.
Like a "date" date?
Yeah, you know, a restaurant candlelight, bottle of wine--
At the end of the night, I try to take your clothes off?
Ooh. Okay, that's... that would be a date.
Hey. You're...
Naked and waiting for you.
You keep a diary?
Have I not known that all this time,
that you keep a diary?
No, I-I-I don't.
I, uh--
Aw, don't be shy. I think it's cute.
It's not mine.
I won't read it. Whose is it?
Your mother's.
It was in a big box full of old issues
of "The New England Journal of Medicine."
Did you read it?
No.
I brought it up here for you.
Why were you going through her things?
I was trying to find space for my clothes.
Your closet is full.
I have to, um, shower.
I've been hauling Cristina's boxes.
You haven't read any of it?
No, what if I'm in it?
I don't want to hear what she thought of me.
I've heard enough of that already.
What's worse, if you're in it or you're not in it?
I don't know. But I mean, see, why is he in the study
rooting around in closets...
trying to dig up my mother's ghost?
I think 'cause you invited him.
Apparently some people thought I was kidding last week
when I announced that nobody was going to get to hang out
on their favorite specialty anymore.
I wasn't. Junior residents don't specialize.
So all the requests to send you back
to that place where your true heart lives can end now.
Dr. Bailey makes the assignments.
Do not, and I repeat, do not harangue her.
Look, O'malley, I made a call.
They don't have your score yet. If I knew, I would tell you.
You passed.
We're gonna go to Joe's tonight and we're gonna celebrate.
I'm gonna buy you a beer and all the peanuts you can eat.
What if I didn't pass?
Well, then I'm still buying you a beer.
Beer for losers.
Grey, you're on cardio with Hahn today.
Oh, but...
Stevens and Karev, pit.
Oh, come on.
That's not... The chief wants us to have a change.
That's not a change.
I'm always stuck in the pit with Alex.
When the chief said don't harangue Dr. Bailey,
What do you think he meant? Yang, clinic.
What? What? No.
No. No, no, wait, wait.
The clinic is mine. I say how it's staffed.
Yeah, yeah.
She'll just ruin it.
Yeah, I will. I'll-I'll ruin it.
Just let me do it.
No, you will not. You will do what I say.
And since Yang couldn't be bothered to show up
at the clinic since it opened,
Think of it as a new frontier in her training.
Sorry.
Oh, oh, oh, my god. You're totally not sorry.
You're psyched. You got Hahn. If you're not, you should be.
Well, she's terrifying. And you have given her
unrealistic expectations as to what a resident should know.
Just stay on top of the material, and don't get
all warm and fuzzy with the patients. She hates that.
Okay.
If you have any questions, just come and ask me.
I'll be in the clinic putting band-aids on stupid whiners
who don't have the balls to get real injuries.
One through four, let's go. Come on.
I didn't read the diary.
I just found it and put it on the table.
I would've read it.
Every time I actually do something
to move into the house, she freaks out.
What are you gonna do with the trailer?
No.
Come on.
This is a very real possibility she kickes me out in a week.
I'm not letting go of the trailer..
Sutures, fecal impaction and more sutures.
She'll do it.
What do you mean, she'll do it?
You're good at boring, stupid crap.
You're like a specialist.
Hi, I'm Dr. Stevens.
Looks like you need some stitches. What happened?
I have a cut.
How'd you get it?
I threw a remote at him, okay? It's no big secret.
I threw it at him because all he can do is watch television
or fall asleep like a dead person.
Honey
Don't "honey" me. I'm divorcing you.
As soon as you stop bleeding from your head,
We're going to a lawyer.
You ever been to Europe?
Nope. Someday.
Don't wait until you're retired
And you can't be bothered to look out the window.
6-month trip across the world...
I've been waiting for it for 15 years...
He slept through the whole thing.
Marianne...
Six continents.
I worked for 30 years. I was very tired.
Well, I'm tired, too,
of being married to somebody with no interest in the world,
So everybody's tired. I'm gonna go get some coffee.
I assume this is going to take forever.
Probably.
Does your mouth always do that, move to the side like that?
Like what? Huh.
Mind if I run some tests?
Whatever you want.
Great.
I may be wrong about this, but I think Mr. Grandy
has a major neuro thing going on.
So get him stitched up and then get him up for a C.T., okay?
Okay.
Oh, give me that.
Give it.
Mr. Grandy, uh, I'm Dr. Karev,
and I will be taking you up for your C.T. today.
Duncan Paley, age 8, recently diagnosed
with aortic valve disease from an infectious endocarditis.
He's scheduled for a ross procedure today.
There's a note from his pediatrician...
Duncan!
Duncan, get back here.
Duncan!
Stop him. Grab him.
Go.
Sorry.
Duncan.
Duncan. Duncan, come back here.
Duncan, you get down from there right now. Duncan, get off the chair.
No, do not. Don't touch the fire alarm.
Do not pull that. That would be very, very bad.
I'm not having surgery.
Munchkin...
No!
Come on, kiddo, get down.
I'm not doing it.
One, two...
Counting doesn't work.
No!
Three.
I think this is all gonna be okay if we just-- Promise me no surgery.
Promise me no surgery.
O--I--We--
We can't really do that.
Evacuate. Evacuate.
Evacuate.
This is an emergency.
Evacuate.
Do we have this kid under control,
or do I have to call social services?
He won't do anything like that again.
He'd better not. The damn ceiling fell last week.
I don't need a series of false alarms.
This place looks ridiculous enough already.
Keep the ankle biter under control.
I'll sedate him if I have to.
Good, and bone up on your pulmonary autografts.
I don't want to spend the day bathed in your ignorance
as well as your incompetence.
Oh, she hates me.
What do you mean, we'll sedate him if we have to?
I was just trying not to be warm and fuzzy.
I don't mean sedate him, I just mean babysit him.
It's your last day as an intern.
Just think of how happy you'll be to move on.
I'm gonna be in the O.R. till 7:00.
Is 8:00 too late for dinner?
No, but if you need to reschedule or cancel--
Come on. Are you kidding?
I made a reservation at canto.
I even gamed out an outfit.
We are doing this.
So Hahn is doing a ross procedure,
And she thinks I'm a moron. Well,
First of all, it's called a pulmonary autograft
She likes the technical names. Okay, tell her you're excited
To watch her harvest the pulmonary valve
Using her septal-sparing technique.
If you cut too much of the septal muscle,
The patient won't be able to come off pump. None of that is in the book.
It's the key to the case. It'll make you sound like
You've been around the block once or twice. Perfect.
I can't believe I am giving you all my best stuff
You totally don't deserve it. Uh, dr. Yang.
Mrs. Borsokowski needs your loving attention.
Redness, itching, inflammation--a rash.
You're giving me a rash?
No, she's the mean one. I don't want her.
O-okay.
All right. What do we got?
Take a look. The thing's bigger than a baseball.
It's right behind his eyes.
This should be fun. Page Stevens.
She left the guy with me.
She gave you the case?
Yeah, well, Izzie felt bad for me.
You know, figured this would cheer me up.
In that case, you're gonna help me pull this thing out.
Hey, Duncan.
We're gonna put an i.V. in your arm real quick,
And then you can go back to your playing, okay? What is it?
Oh, it's a little tube we put in your arm. No.
Duncan-- no, it's gonna hurt.
Come on, kiddo. It's not gonna hurt. No, it's gonna hurt.
It's a needle. It's gonna hurt.
But it's only for, what, three seconds?
I don't believe you.
You don't believe me?
Do you want me to prove it to you?
I'll prove it. I'll have dr. Grey put one in me.
This is a tourniquet,
And, uh, you wrap it around your arm
So that your vein pops out.
See? Like that?
So now the needle--
That's the part that's gonna hurt.
That goes in,
And that's--yeah.
Hurting. That hurts.
It hurts and...
It doesn't hurt any more.
And now that stuff goes into here.
Doesn't hurt at all.
Okay, I'll do it.
Okay. Then I'll go get another i.V. Kit.
Okay. Okay.
You're really good at this.
Oh, I was an airplane guy, too, when I was his age.
Us airplane guys,
I think we just like to know how things work.
I'm sorry about the alarm.
I know.
Move!
They have the nerve to be indignant
About how they're not allowed
To be on their specialties anymore.
They don't have specialties.
They should be grateful they're even allowed in the--
Are you listening to me?
I'm going on a date with Erica Hahn.
And, uh, that's awkward
'cause, uh...
She's a colleague and because she's an attending
And because she's a she.
And, uh, there's been kissing,
But, uh, no touching.
And what if I'm not into it?
What if I'm horrible
At all that's tough... South...
Of the border?
'cause I've never been south of the border
With a female.
I mean, i--i've never even been over the, uh,
Northern mountains, you know what I'm saying?
We're gonna pretend this didn't happen.
Mr. Grandy? What are you doing in here?
They admitted me.
My new doctor, dr. Karev,
Said I have a huge tumor in my head.
Have you seen my wife?
Your new doctor?
Somebody paged me?
Oh, I have a patient with tenderness and erythema
Extending from her upper chest to her left arm.
I'm thinking she needs irrigation and debridement.
She said you may have to amputate my arm.
No. That's a simple rash.
(以前有个病人得食肉菌 杨总想截肢)
It's probably dermatitis. No, no, no, but look how the skin is denuded.
It could be surgical, right? It's possible-- it's
A rash. If it's dry, wet it. If it's wet, dry it
Go to derm, get a tube of cerave cream,
And don't ever page me to hustle a surgery again.
It was supposed to be done yesterday, done.
So exactly why did I walk into my O.R.
And still see a massive, gaping hole
In where the ceiling was supposed to be?
If you see Karev, get an 18-gauge needle
And shove it in his throat. I have cultivated a look
That says I'm not interested in your personal problems.
Can you morons not read that look,
Or have I lost the hang of it? Because people are telling me
A lot of personal problems today.
I don't give a crap about your crushing workload
Or your baffling love life or your carpal tunnel syndrome.
All I care about is mrs. Carrucci,
A 92-year-old woman who no one can seem to find.
I'm dr. Pepman. Can I help you?
Where can I get some cerave cream?
Our nurses look like they're tied up,
But if you don't mind waiting, I can get it for you myself.
Would you like some water with raspberries while you wait?
yeah, sure.
Chris.
don't mind Chris.
He's our massage therapist.
Your... Uh, what?
Our Hands do such delicate work,
It's important that they stay healthy.
So we have Chris on staff to work on us
When we have a spare moment.
Every attending gets their Hands massaged at work?
no.
The dermatology attendings have another therapist.
Chris just works on the residents.
You're a resent?
First year,
And loving it.
So I'll make an incision ear to ear
Then peel down the face. And I'll crack open his forehead,
Pull the tumour right out.
Close to his optic nerve.
Somebody twitches, and this guy's blind.
Which one of your roommates will be assisting? Karev.
great.
Dr. Shepherd, I want back on this case. Mm-hmm.
This is my patient. Alex stole him from me.
Remember when I was telling you that-- dr. Stevens, let's be clear.
In this hospital, I am not your roommate.
I don't give a crap about your personal problems.
I have a resident. I don't need another one. Dr. Shepherd.
Yes? Patient's in his room
If you want to go over the procedure with him. Great.
You son of a bitch.
Go cry to somebody who cares.
This is my case. It isn't fair.
Surgery's like the wild West.
You didn't get your claim in montana from the bank.
You got it 'cause you put a fence around it
And shot the ass off anyone who walked by.
Karev's a cowboy. You're not.
We're gonna transect the great arteries
At the sinotubular ridge,
Use the autograft to replace the aortic root,
And then attach a pulmonary homograft.
Are you going to use the septal-sparing technique
For the pulmonary autograft? Yes, why do you ask?
Well, because if we cut too much of the septal muscle,
We won't be able to take the patient off pump, right?
Right.
Great. I've always wanted to see a septal-sparing technique.
Do you know how to reanastomose the coronary arteries
Back on to the aorta? I do.
Well, I'll let you sew part of it in.
Gonna be in there. Might as well get your Hands dirty.
Great. Thanks, dr. Hahn.
You're going to hell 'cause you're a liar.
Was it obvious?
Unfortunately, no.
What?
What happened? Look.
You paged me 9-1-1.
I'm in the middle of studying for Hahn's pulmonary autograft,
And I don't see an emergency. No, no, no.
They're residents.
That one... Baked a 7-layer cake
For that one's birthday, from scratch.
Oh,and that one, that one's, uh, girlfriend...
Is taking him skiing this weekend.
Oh, but this one's the best.
Okay, this one gets to leave to go get a facial.
And she told her attending, and her attending was happy
'cause they have to have facials.
They're dermatologists.
I mean... Oh, my god.
The hospital has hired someone to rub them...
Full-time.
I bet their boyfriends don't go digging around
In their closets without asking. Never.
Ooh. I told Hahn I knew how to do
A coronary artery reanastomosis.
You don't.
I know. I looked it up, but the kid's 8.
He's got tiny little arteries. Okay, you know what?
Um, snag me some of those grapes there,
And I'll teach you.
Oh, and then find dr. Daisy Pepman.
Ask her for a suture kit and a 7-0 polypropylene. Dr. Daisy Pepman?
She's a resident. She pours fruity drinks.
'cause she has time for that kind of thing.
And I like saying her name.
So is that hyphenated, or did her parents
Name her Daisy-- no, no. Hey, no--no mocking
There is no mocking in derm...
only warmth and light.
You all right Mrs Paley?
You want to know what duncan's doing?
Packing to leave
And I can't stop him
I suck at this
I'm tired and I'm fried
Because I lie awake at night listening to him breathe
because I'm afraid his heart's gonna stop and
And he's gonna die and I'll have been sleeping
I don't know how to do this
Well no one knows
How to be the mom of a kid with heart failure
Nobody teaches that
And you have a really smart kid You know that
We just need to up our game a little bit Can I try?
Oh go for it
A base ball?
Which is why you were so lethargic.
Why slept through most of our trip breath?
Not because I am boring,not interested in cultures of the world.
How was I supposed to know?
You were supposed to give me the benefit of the doubt,not throw electronics at me.
Mrs Grandy, this is a massive tumour
And the area is hard to reach.And we want to talk about this to your wife.
Oh I am sure she is fine with the rest.
Honey
I'm going through it, then nothing left lose.
See you in the OR.
Dr. Shepherd,that is my patient.,that is my patient.I'm sure you can use the resident even if you cannot.
Stevens,I am not the traffic cop on the playground.
No,it's not the playground. It's the wild,wild west.
Can't you be the sheriff? I'll think of you when we crack his forehead open
I'm not letting you do this to me Alex
Do not walk away from me Karev
Give me back my surgery or I'll shoot your ass off!
He stole a very big surgery
I'll pick it up
What'd you do with the diary? It's in my locker
Hey do you want me to screen it for you?
Magic Marker Out all the scary parts
No No one's reading it
Okay now don't here
Don't pull too hard You're stretching the skin
Alex stole my patient
With a grapefruit growing behind his eyes
And your boyfriend couldn't give a crap
And just in case I wasn't sure
He actually said the words i don't give a crap Okay see that guy there Okay?
He's a resident
He's dragging 'cause he got too much sleep last night
Uh-Huh Too much
What?
It's like watching a living freak show
I don't talk about sex
Please let's just pretend I never said even a single word
I don't talk about sex with anyone ever
Not any kind of sex Bailey I am begging you
The vah-Jay-Jay
Is undiscovered country.
It is the motherland
You've never traveled there
You don't know its customs and ways
Now me I've always wanted to go to africa
Uh but if I go
I'm going to have to learn a few things first
I'm going to have to prepare I'll need shots
Um bring my own syringes in case something goes wrong
And And I'll want to know how to get to the embassy
Just Okay now you've lost me
Just talk about it
Not with me With the other one
Just talk about the rules uh the expectations
Figure out how to gracefully demure
If you find that you don't like the The local cuisine
In ethiopia
They eat stew off of spongy sour bread
That's not for everyone
Mer I need you
Shh Harshing the vibe
What are you doing?
Cristina found this magical world
Where doctors are happy and patients are pleasant
And no one is screaming or stealing surgeries
Everyone just rubs each other
All day long You all want to be dermatologists?
Dermatologists apply lotion for a living
Yeah that's the point Come here
Come here
They're empty inside
Completely devoid of blood lust
They don't need to fight for anything
They don't want to cut anyone open
They just love lotion
Do you know how much easier our life would be
If we could just love lotion?
How do you think they got that way?
Their mothers didn't leave diaries around
For them to read
Sloan told me today to stake my claim
In the wild wild west
So I went all cowboy on Alex's ass
And I still don't have my surgery
These women
they do not have to stake a claim
Okay You all need to snap out of it
Izzie... in the wild, wild west
There is always a woman in the saloon
And nody messes with her even though they all have guns
She's a prostitute
The woman in the saloon is a whore George
No She just has other skills she uses
To make her way in the world
So just uh use what you got
Mer I'm gonna take this and I need you
To help me sell an idea to Hahn and the chief
Cristina
You're coming too
Cristina
How you doing Mr Grandy?
Well um I've got a tumor
That's been compared to a baseball
A grapefruit and an alien living inside my head
And my wife
who was ready to divorce me
Even before she knew that I was damaged goods
She won't even look at me
No, I'm sure she's just freaked out about the tumor
It happens a lot. What if it isn't just the tumor?
I mean what if she's figured out
That she just doesn't like me?
No
You're a really likable guy I can tell
You're a nice girl
is your new doctor as nice as me Dr Karev
He's all right
That's good
Yeah
He was having some personal problems
Depression

Off his game?
Well it sounds like he's bouncing back
You'll be fine Wait a minute
I don't want someone who's off his game
Can I get uh you back?
well you could talk to Dr Shepherd
Tell him you don't want Dr Karev on your case
And then I'm all yours
What happened? She said she was feeling faint,
And I thought she was just pissed
About waiting for her cream Her pulse ox is 90?
Yeah and the oxygen's not helping
Get her to the e.R.
Why didn't you move her to the e.R.? Well I didn't know what to do
So you are just standing?-I have paged you, What the hell have you been?
Supportive care steroids Give her 16 of dexamethasone
My way
Hurry Come on!
B.P.'S going back up
Okay um call Dr Bailey
And tell her the patient needs a plasmapheresis
And a skin biopsy stat.
You stole my surgery. It's my surgery.
Using me as a doormat is one thing.
Screwing with my career is another.
I have been wiping your snot
And covering your ass for weeks now,
And all you've done is abuse me.
And for a little while you get to do that
Because you're heartbroken and pathetic
And I'm a good friend but it ends now
Get your own surgeries and wipe your own snot Dr Shepherd that's my surgery
The patient made the request Karev
Nothing I can do
60% of her skin sloughed off I'm surprised she didn't crash
When she got out of bed this morning Dr Sloan didn't catch it
When he was down here for a consult?
Oh he may have been distracted by the fact
I told him it was necrotizing fasciitis
That would do it
Uh can I do the biopsy?
Well sure
I didn't know you had a big interest in dermatology.
No I don't just the surgical part
That's all right. It's good. Branch out.
No Dr Bailey I'm not interested in derm
atology
We're doing a bicoronal incision
Expect a lot of bleeding
Once I get going, it'll all happen fast,
So stay with me.
Stevens grab a bovie
All right Here we go
You are not bringing an 8-Year-Old child
Into the o.R. He's scared and he doesn't know what's gonna happen
And there is no way for him to imagine it Letting the boy see a bloody o.R.
Isn't gonna help matters O'malley
Dr Hahn has a thorascopic lung resection in an hour
Three tiny incisions no blood nothing scary And what's that gonna do?
It's gonna show him the room the people the instruments
Someone under anesthesia who's still alive.
Pinning him down and doping him up is
it's gonna be traumatic for him and it's
showing him how it works is such an easy fix
You can't see can you?
Nope
I don't want to go in there
Scared?
Well there's not gonna be any blood
Nothing gross nothing scary
It's just three tiny cuts
That are so small you can barely see them
The first time that I went in there
In that room I was scared
But that room
Is the most magical room in the world
Only the finest doctors get to go in there
And a lot of the great ones
They're not even allowed to touch anything
They can just watch
I'm pretty good so I'm still a watcher
The people that work in there, they're just
They're the best the very best
It's the safest place you'll ever be in
In your entire life
Where'd that guy's face go?
You lost O'malley?
Sorry.
No, wait! I want to see! I want to see the guy with no face!
Stop! Stop!
Never mention this happened to anyone,
I'll give you whatever you want for the rest of your life.
Okay?
Okay.
Good afternoon, duncan. Come on in and take a look.
I want to go back to the other one.
We're not talking about the other one.
This one's boring.
Yeah, we are here be boring, too
Do I get the big lights?
Yeah, you get all the big lights.
Where's the suctioner?
It's right over there.
Can I feel it? I just want to feel it once.
Move over first.
Can I touch the scalpel?
You just need to lie down.
I just want to see everything.
Look here. See this?
Yeah.
That's a video camera.
You'll be able to watch the whole thing when it's over.
Start shooting right now.
What?
Lie down.
See you after surgery.
Don't squeeze too hard.
The teeth on the forceps can leave holes.
That's good.
Very good. Keep going with that plane.
Great. Okay, let me take a look.
Cowboys don't have friends.
Dr. Grey, you ready?
Okay, good visualization, and start suturing right here.
All right. Keep going.
Very nice.
All right. Give her a little room, O'malley.
Okay.
Beautiful.
You can tell Dr. Yang
She's a better teacher than I would've thought.
Sorry.
Save it.
If your colleagues know more than you do,
Milk 'em for all they're worth.
But you lie to me again about your experience,
And the next heart you see will be your own
As I cut it out of your chest with a steak knife.
Mrs. Grandy?
your husband is in recovery.
It was a tough procedure,
But overall, it went really well.
He's gonna be okay, Mrs. Grandy.

He was sick, and I told him he was lazy and boring.
He was sick. You didn't know.
Well, I'm his wife. I should've known.
He was...
People are terrible to the people they love sometimes.
They're mean.
You were both going through a really hard time,
And you took it out on one another.
It isn't fun, but it is what people do.
That doesn't make you the worst wife in the world.
It just makes you... a person who made a mistake.
I miss anything good?
You're gonna love is.
The redhead just gave the short one a case
Because she thought he'd find it interesting--
We could transfer Maybe we'd be happier
We'd die of boredom
We'd die with great skin Hmm
I had the biggest derm emergency
That exists today,
And it was fun for about a minute,
'Cause a woman almost died, but then we saved her.
And all she needed was a stupid biopsy I tore a guy's face off
I reattached a coronary artery

I can't help it.
I'm pissed off all the time, so much, I can't even breathe.
But you can't be pissed at a crazy chick
For losing her mind,
So there's nobody else to be pissed at except you.
Nobody else
We need to have rules
What?
Rules We--We need rules
About how we're gonna deal with the motherland.
Because it's undiscovered country
And maybe
maybe it'll be the best vacation
Either of us has ever had,
But it's mysterious
and dark
and there should be rules
oh and And an embassy
and a safe word.
I'm sorry.
What the hell are you talking about?
Below the
below the mason-Dixon line
Of your pants
I'm not sure I'm ready to go there
Me neither
There's lots of undiscovered territory
above the belt.
Uh, we can take it slow.
Maybe... just...
first base?
Okay.
Whew. Okay. Thank you.
Sorry.
Here, finish my wine.
I'm gonna look at the menu
while you let your blood pressure drop back down to normal.
Erica.
Maybe second base, too.
I could always move back to the trailer.
No, I want you here.
I mean, I may not always be so graceful about it,
But... I want you here.
You need a place for your things.
It's not an unreasonable request.
You can use this as your den or your office or whatever.
It's your mom's den.
But she isn't here.
You are.
What about you?
You need someplace,
Someplace you can get away to.
Well, I can always go to Cristina's or whatever.
I think I have a better idea.
We like to think we're fearless,
eager to explore unknown lands and soak up new experiences,
But the fact is, we're always terrified.
Maybe the terror is part of the attraction.
Some people go to horror movies.
We cut things open, dive into dark waters.
"October 13, 1977.
I haven't slept in three days."
And at the end of the day,
isn't that what you'd rather hear about
if you've got one drink and one friend and 45 minutes?
Smooth rides make for boring stories.
A little calamity... That's worth talking about.
