There he is.
Black Jack Massarone.
I saw this and I thought of you.
Ho, look at that!
Guy's local.
He makes them as part of a program for disabled vets.
A little gift to show my gratitude for all our work together.
Thanks.
Look at those guys, huh?
They had some times, huh?
You know we're finally gonna cut the ribbon for the museum on the 22nd.
They're gonna ask me to make a little speech
on the challenges of contemporary urban development.
Thank you.
Somethin' for you?
I'll have what he's having.
Listen, my buddy in city plan check says he just pulled a permit
to turn the old bus station into a mixed use.
The thing is, Zellman still hasn't given me a number.
Has he said anything to you about another bid?
Oh, we don't talk much.
Take your hat off. Relax.
Yeah, I just started on the Rogaine.
Listen, you think maybe you could ask Ron
if this falls under the same arrangement?
Kinda soggy, you wanna know the truth.
Tony, this is federal redevelopment.
I'll look into it.
So, a speech, huh?
Yeah.
The Museum of Science and Truckin'.
I just wish my mother could've seen it.
Well, wherever she is, I'm sure she's proud.
Actually, I think I know exactly where she is and it's pretty fuckin' hot.
You had one of those, too, huh?
Gentlemen.
Is everything okay here?
Yeah, sure. Just talkin'.
Okay then. Have a good night.
So they go through labor. Big deal. Try a prostate exam.
This is great.
And I usually don't like modern art.
The Rat Pack.
Do you know a Joseph "Joey" Cogo?
Not much, I mean, I met him...
last week.
Me and Chrissy were havin' dinner with Tony and his friend, Valentina.
Joey Cogo sent over a bottle of Veuve.
Wanna show her those?
Was this man with him?
Yeah. I saw him.
You're sure?
Tuesday night.
Jesus, 'cause of what I said?
You're supposed to be earners. That's why you got the top tier positions.
So each one of ya go out to your people on the street, crack some fuckin'...
Create some fuckin' earners out there!
So, what's he sayin'?
The way I remember he said,
"That's why you got the top tier positions."
This other inaudible is "Crack fuckin' heads," not legs.
I need a signature.
Now that's it. That's all I gotta say.
Frankly, I'm depressed and...
Depressed and what?
"Depressed and ashamed."
So what about my Alan Stewart shirt from that meeting?
Ralph Cifaretto spilt my coffee and ruined it.
I can petty cash it. Resubmit, okay?
This Crazy Horse pole camera's working out really good.
Paulie Gualtieri's car again. She's still lying.
Listen, any chance you could ask Ron if this falls under the same arrangement?
It's kinda soggy, you wanna know the truth.
Pie. He was eating.
Tony, this is federal redevelopment.
I'll look into it.
So a speech, huh?
The sound quality is amazing.
New hats. Mic's right in the button.
Museum of Science and Truckin'.
I just wish my mother could've seen it.
Give it to Angela and shut the door.
Wherever she is, I'm sure she's proud.
What happened to the jury tampering investigation on Junior Soprano's trial?
Actually, l...
You guys just drop the ball on that?
Massarone's a huge asset.
Couple him with...
What? Three-year-old airline tickets?
Some ties to the Bevelaqua murder?
Even if Massarone and 1,000 other snitches pan out,
we've still gotta put Tony on trial.
That's useless until we find out how
they penetrated the anonymous jury system.
And what? Jury duty's not tough enough?
You know we don't like to dig into some citizen.
Tough shit. One of those citizens is a felon.
Get on it.
You know what's goin' on here, right?
He fucked up his six-figure future with O'Melveny & Meyers
when he blew the Junior Soprano trial.
Of course he'll keep tryin' him until he fixes that.
There he is, John Barrymore.
How are ya?
All right.
I thought nobody ever comes to see you.
I was droppin' off some dandelions.
Saw a beautiful patch in a vacant lot over by 15th Street.
Nice salad.
Any word about Tony B?
Yeah, yeah, should be any day now.
Aunt Quintina's gonna call the moment she hears.
He's a good kid, your cousin, huh? Smart.
Fuckin' weirdo, you ask me.
All right, the vacant lot over on 15th Street?
That's where all the neighborhood dogs go to piss.
You goddamn clown.
You got anything lined up for the kid?
Yeah, yeah, air-bags. We pull 'em from boosted cars.
People buy 'em like you wouldn't fuckin' believe.
Hey, legit dealers, body shops...they reinstall undeployed bags as new.
Top dollar.
Brave new world.
Jesus Christ, they didn't even have shoulder belts when I went away.
So you'll let me know when the kid gets out, huh?
Yeah, we'll have a party for him.
I love you, okay.
All right. Come on, eat. Don't be so sensitive.
I was bein' polite. It's like... it's like eatin' red fescue.
I'll take an egg. You want an egg? Bobby, make my nephew an egg.
I don't want an egg.
Tony B.
Like a welcome home present.
What's that, a Motorola?
Yeah.
Supposed to be the best.
You know, I figured he could use one. Call me when he needs me.
All the fellas are gettin' out, huh?
The class of 2004. Old rats on a new ship.
I think I'll take an egg. Make us a couple eggs.
I'm doin' it. You told me. He don't want one.
You and Tony Egg again.
Tony Egg? Tony B.
Like the time you two, you took that camera in the bathroom
at your sister Barbara's confirmation.
Oh, that's terrible.
Where is he gonna be laid out?
Who now? God damn it!
Well, let us know.
Carmine Lupertazzi.
He passed during the night.
What a fuckin' blow.
He was a great man.
My cousin told me it was Carmine who invented point shaving
C.C.N.Y. versus Kentucky, 1951.
Nobody beat the spread. I bought a black Fleetwood.
Anthony. Anthony, did I ever tell you I want to be cremated?
About four times.
And don't throw my ashes in somebody's yard or off some fuckin' bridge.
I wanna be on the mantelpiece surrounded by family.
Yeah, under the moose head, I know.
Keep jokin'. Let me tell ya somethin'.
It's like that game we used to play as kids...
crack the whip.
You run around like an idiot holdin' hands as tight as you can
and then the line snaps, somebody lets go...
and you're next.
Your father meant a lot to all of us. And not just financially either.
How are ya?
What's up, buddy?
Nicole...
you remember Mr. Petrille?
What, honey?
He meant a lot to us.
Ginny. Phil, how ya doin'?
Hey, kid.
Angelo.
I'm heartbroken.
Nicole, you remember Mr. Garepe.
Of course.
That was my aunt. My cousin's out.
Aw, that's great news.
Start him off small, T.
You hear that? Your cousin's out.
Oh, look who's comin'.
What?
Hey there, handsome.
Hey, baby.
How are ya?
Good.
Lorraine, you're lookin' good.
Yeah, keepin' it together with pilates and gin.
Sil, Paulie, how's it hangin'?
Still got the nice manners, huh?
this is my nephew Christopher.
Lady Shylock, you got some reputation.
Yeah, my mother said that might happen.
I'd like to introduce you to the love of my life.
This is my partner Jason Evanina.
Honor to meet ya.
Hey, how are ya?
So Jesus leans off the cross and whispers to Peter,
"I can see your house from here."
I'm so sorry. This was such a shock.
This is a very hard day.
I just saw Ginny. The flowers are beautiful.
John, got a minute?
Yeah.
Nicole, I'm sorry.
What's goin' on here?
What are you talkin' about?
My father.
Look at his hands.
He looks peaceful.
I'm talkin' about his rosary. The medal?
You think I don't know what that is? It's for Opus Dei.
The fuck is that about?
In his later years, your father was very
sensitive about what's been goin' on in the church.
Bullshit! Your wife is into Opus Dei.
You told Colombino to put it there.
You sure about that?
Yes, John, I'm sure.
Body's not even cold.
No respect for anything anymore.
And New Jersey housewife fundamentalist shit? I doubt it, John.
You yourself said I was like another son to him.
I was bein' polite. It was his deathbed.
I should've written those words down.
Maybe you should have, 'cause they don't mean anything anymore.
You understand what I'm sayin'?
I saw a huge mushroom cloud
from the shell.
Jim Campbell might be alive today
if he hadn't said to me,
"Heffron, you stay here with your gun.
I'm going up."
All your life,
you gotta remember what one guy did because he thought it was his job to do
and he took a shot for you.
This shit's not supposed to run and here I look like a raccoon.
You are irresistible and you know it.
Danny said I was clingy.
Fuck him. He's the one with self-esteem issues.
You don't know what it's like out there,
Ade. You're marrying Christopher.
He's handsome, makes money, he's got great hair.
Okay.
You know I love animals, but this thing is so gorgeous.
Isn't it? My dad almost had a stroke.
But I told him, "Hey, asshole, I'm the one taking all the fucking risk here.
I have to fake the invoices."
Sometimes you gotta just take care of yourself, you know?
Sure you do, honey.
Come here.
Come on. Let's don't keep your date waiting.
He likes you, I can tell.
We got a white wine for Ade.
That's another apple martini for you.
Thank you, my dear.
My Seven-and-7,
and nothing-and-nothing.
Don't listen to him, Chrissy.
I think what you're doing's brave.
It's not for everybody.
Things are different when you don't have that crutch, you know?
We make up for it other ways.
My God, it's hot in here.
What do you expect? You're dancing in a mink coat.
It's fox.
She's my fox in a box.
Let's see her box, or maybe her socks.
Stupid.
Well, I have to wear fur on the outside
on account of being bare everywhere else.
You believe this one?
No shit.
Every place I go, I got substances I can't enjoy shoved in my face.
But I guess asking you for a little support system
in my own home is way the fuck outta line.
You gotta have some more wine.
Seemed to have a good time tonight.
What the fuck you talking about?
What, Tina?
Come on, that cunt's too full of herself, anyway.
Cunt? She's my maid of honor, Christopher.
She's no fucking maid, let me tell you.
Great, now I'm upset. See what I'm talking about?
But I guess it's all my problem.
I'm sorry, baby.
Okay?
Please,
stop.
All right, all right. My handsome nephew.
Auntie Quin, look at you all dolled up, huh?
I never thought I'd live to see this day.
Well, here ya are, still here.
Where's Tony?
Downstairs...
getting into one of his old suits.
I'll buy him some new suits.
He's fine.
I only wish he had more to come back to.
That ex-wife of his...
she uses her answering machine to ignore me,
so forget about his seeing the twins.
How's Kelly? How's she doing?
Well, she's lost to us, Anthony.
But Tony says he's gonna hire a detective.
Look at this.
The two of you were so cute.
Even then, my cannoli was bigger than his.
Ooh, stop.
Aw, man. There he is.
Ah. God, Ton'.
Look at us. 15 fucking years.
The language.
Go ahead say it. I haven't changed a bit, right?
You look good, you look good.
Say "provolone."
Surprise!
Shit.
Very nice, you give me a heart attack.
Ma, it's enough, all right?
Stop crying. I'm embarrassed enough.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything. Just eat.
I got peppers been marinating for 15 years!
What?
Where's Tubs?
Artie? What happened here?
Still a ball-breaker, huh?
What the fuck's with him?
Ask him.
You guys have a beef?
I loaned the guy some money
then he tried to kill himself. And guess who got the blame?
Oh my God, Tony.
My God, we have all missed you so much.
I swear, you look exactly the same.
Oh, you're still full of shit, huh?
Is Nancy here yet? The twins?
No, Nancy couldn't make it.
Her aunt in Bayonne, the sciatica.
What are you gonna do?
Cousin!
Jan.
Come, come, I want you to meet my family.
I'm talking to him right now.
Tony, you remember Bobby.
Good to see you.
Now my husband.
And guys, this is your Uncle Tony Blundetto.
Hey, there.
How come we never met you before?
I've been away on business.
I've never even heard of you.
Stop playing with your ice, come on.
They let that kid say anything.
Welcome home, Uncle Tony.
This is Meadow.
God, you turned out beautiful, honey.
And this strapping young man is Anthony Jr.
How's Kelly?
Our regular dinner, out by you Thursday, right?
Yes, Daddy.
See with my family now, you know, the separation,
you gotta make an appointment to see each other.
I should go see Uncle Zio.
Yeah.
All right.
Show him the phone!
Yeah.
Tony.
I'll make this fast 'cause I know you're all hungry.
I remember growing up, I was always asking
why I just used to have sisters.
I said to my mother, I said, "Can't you save up something
and then get me a baby brother?"
And my mother said, "What's wrong with your cousin Tony?"
And she was right, 'cause we were brothers.
Except, you know, we had the same name.
There was like 50 Tonys in the family.
Some of you remember this.
My dad's name was Johnny
and his dad's name was Alfred.
And so whenever we were out running around and we'd hear
"Tony Uncle Johnny," that was for me.
And "Tony Uncle Al," that was for him.
And there was "Tony Uncle Philly!" Remember?
Right, yeah, yeah.
But...
he passed away... buon' anima.
And Uncle Phil...Uncle Phil, he passed away a long time ago, too.
So...anyway.
Tony's being away...
has been hard.
But he's back now,
for good.
So welcome home.
Welcome home.
Thank you.
Come on, let me hear it. Welcome home!
Welcome home!
Tony, Meadow is incredible. She's a fucking lvy Leaguer.
You and Carm hit a home run.
Yeah.
I'm sure Kelly's all right, wherever she is.
Hey, her old man was in prison.
We tried to do everything we could.
I wasn't around. What could I expect?
If things had gone different way back when, who knows?
What do you want from me?
Nothing! I'm just saying it's good it wasn't both of us.
These things happen, right?
You're gonna like this place. This is nice.
This is the kind of place we always talked about having.
Fucking weird.
My cousin in the old man's seat.
It's like Sun Tizzu says...
"A good commander is benevolent and unconcerned with fame."
What?
Sun Tizzu. The Chinese Prince Machiavelli.
Tony turned me on to him.
Tzu, Tzu!
Sun Tzu, you fucking ass-kiss.
Feech!
You know I missed you by two weeks at Allenwood.
This'll help you get started.
Jesus, you're on your feet already?
You hit the ground running and you don't look back, huh?
Thank you.
Come on.
So you in on the bus station project?
Massarone's waiting on a number.
How's he doing?
Good.
We had coffee.
He used to bore me, Jack.
But he ain't a bad guy once you get to know him.
I always liked him.
I was very touched by that funeral the other day.
Real heart-grabber.
That fucking little Carmine.
And after what?
Five years in Florida fixing wet t-shirt contests.
M'boy are you fat.
What did you say?
Reginald Van Gleason III. "M'boy are you fat."
That's good, yeah.
So I got some ideas, you know, for you. Get you on your feet.
Unless, of course, you already know what you wanna do.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Well, yeah. I kinda got an idea.
Yeah?
Like four years in I got moved to Springfield.
You know, where they got the big prison hospital.
It's mostly stab wounds, detox.
Anyway, this guy I knew from Elkton, he was telling me
how I could be an orderly, you know?
And how it's easy time and all.
Well, you know, so then you're the guy that hooks everybody up. That's smart.
Yeah, but it wasn't business for me.
I mean I really got into this shit.
Rehab block had guys with broken limbs, muscle diseases
and we'd help them back.
So, I think this might be a thing I can do.
I got my associate's degree already. Took me five years.
And now it's only like six months more for my massage license.
So you wanna run a massage parlor?
No.
I'm gonna be a licensed massage therapist.
Look, I've been away from all this a long time.
I mean if I got a shot at staying out and putting shit together,
I should take it.
'Cause I was thinking, you know,
I got this air-bag thing going...
Oh, Tony, thanks, but...I mean it's a really nice offer,
but I need regular work until I'm certified.
Just regular work.
Well, I guess I know this guy looking for...
a delivery man for his linen fleet.
Bobby Gociletto?
No, no, no, Koreans.
You know, I don't got my driver's license.
So you'll go to my guy at the DMV.
As far as the union shit, I can take care of that.
Wow, Tony. Thanks. Thank you.
You're the best, you know that?
Yeah, yeah.
Out.
Why?
Because we are watching a movie and you are studying.
And why must we keep having that conversation?
Here it is. On the American Film Institute's Greatest American Movies list.
"Citizen Kane."
Jesus, it's black and white.
That is what film club is all about... trying new things.
Now, to give us some background,
let's see what Leonard Maltin has to say.
"A film that broke all the rules and invented some new ones.
The cinematography, music and Oscar-winning screenplay
by Welles and Herman J-something are all first rate."
So it was a sled, huh? He should've told somebody.
I think it's fascinating the man had all that stuff,
but he died alone with nothing and nobody.
Good. Prick.
I hated it. "You supply the war. I'll supply the headlines." How conceited.
There was the cinematography.
Yeah, that was very good.
What?
I saw Laura Basi in the dressing room at Loehmann's.
Definitely had some work. D-cup at least and a lift.
Well, she said she was remodeling her upstairs. But I had no idea.
So, Carm, how you doing?
I'm okay.
My lawyer, he's a top guy... Robert Greenberg.
He says that New Jersey has this equitable distribution law.
So apparently 20 years entitles me to at least half his money.
Well, it should. You made Tony a home,
you raised his children. Does this guy know how to get it?
Well, it's mostly cash, obviously.
God, all those years and you could get nothing.
This other lawyer, Dan Minditch says that we should play hardball.
You know, go after the real assets.
Marriage is beautiful in the beginning, but two, three years later?
You'd think there'd be some romance at least.
Janice, you're a newlywed.
I know.
Six months and Bobby still hasn't found my rosebud.
Maybe he should hire a reporter.
So the movie's over and they all start talking about their marriages
and how miserable they are.
Bitterness.
So besides the movie night?
You have kids?
No.
So did you attend Carmine Lupertazzi's funeral?
I didn't know him.
Movie night was fun, though.
Who was there at the Tony Blundetto homecoming?
I told you, just family.
God, is that all you think about is your fucking work?
You don't care how I feel about anything.
Okay.
I was married to an agent.
What happened?
Did he cheat on you?
While we were trying to get pregnant he climbed right over me...
to become an assistant supervisor on the Milken task force.
Moved to Los Angeles and jumped a pay grade without me.
My God, that's terrible.
So where were we?
What am I doing? I can't talk to you.
I can't even talk to Christopher and he's my soul mate for God's sake.
I can't talk to my friends.
I am being ripped apart here just snitching on people.
For what? What do I get out of it?
Take some comfort in the fact that you're trying to do the right thing
by helping your government.
No, seriously.
For me, it was when I was in college.
My sister's boyfriend Kyle traded our TV for six handguns.
He sold five to a high school kid then used the last one to open a coconut.
The ricochet left my sister a paraplegic.
I knew I had to do something about guys like him.
And nowhere but the FBI is the
line clearer between the good guys and the bad guys.
And you're with the good guys now.
TB.
I didn't call for no linen delivery.
What do I find at the pork store? A bunch of guys beating the meat.
Wanna deal me in?
Absolutely.
Stakes might be a little high for you.
You know you can't pay us in napkins.
You got to let that dry before you put on a second coat?
Fucking Grandpa Monster over here.
You gonna deal those?
They're not candy bars. You can let some of 'em go.
What the fuck's that for? Drying shirts?
It's a Tao master massage chair.
I had no idea I was so tense.
It's like my back is on vacation.
Well, it could definitely use one.
What the fuck is this?
Hey T, you gotta try this.
He's really fucking good.
Nothing like being in the joint to teach you how to ease another man's tensions.
Jesus Christ, I'm gone for one hour.
All of a sudden it turns into a fucking slumber party.
Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
Could I talk to you a minute?
None of your fucking business which side of the bed I wake up on.
Jesus, it's just an expression.
Bullshit. Don't tell me you don't know what I'm talking about.
All that Reggie Van Gleason, "M'boy are you fat."
Things have changed around here. I'm the boss of this fucking family.
You're crowding me.
You don't make fun of me. Got it?
Got it.
And knock off the massage shit.
It's a place of business, not a Jack LaLanne.
You gotta declare all that?
Most of it, anyway.
Well, if you had a good bookkeeper...
Hey, you got change?
Been fucking sliding this stupid
bill in and out of the cigarette machine for like an hour.
An hour? I bet you can go longer than that.
Listen to you. Why do you always talk like a whore?
Because men like it.
Yeah?
I think you're right about that.
I'm telling you I'm having a fucking time.
Stay out late, come home drunk, fuck anyone I want.
Yeah, so what's the difference?
I don't know. It's a mindset.
Tony, I was hoping you'd be here. I gotta tell you,
you shouldn't eat up there in Fairfield no more.
What the fuck you talking about?
I went to collect from my cop up there and he gave me a heads up.
His buddy on the force saw some
car out by Napoleon's Diner a couple of weeks ago.
And I remembered how your goomah lives up there.
Yeah?
Guy thought maybe they were fags,
but he ran the plate and it bounced back a no-hit.
Feds.
Cop said they were just sitting there in the rain.
They always do that, but I know it wasn't me they tailed that night
'cause my whole life's in the fucking rear view.
Mine, too.
Absolutely.
It's Massarone. Aw, Jesus Christ.
If he flipped I'd be fucked.
We all would.
Well he ain't been to the grand jury,
because we would have heard from our girl up there.
They could be just following him at this point,
see if they could get anything on him.
Yeah, and eventually they'll bring him in.
They've turned a lot fucking tougher guys than Jack Massarone.
You want me to take care of it?
No, we don't know shit yet, right?
He did give me that fucking painting, though.
There was that, Tony.
Can't a guy be fucking nice anymore?
Friendly?
So what do you wanna do?
I wanna be absolutely fucking sure.
That's what I wanna do. We arrange a meet. I'll feel him out a little bit.
I gotta do it. I know the guy. I know the way he thinks.
I know the way he acts.
My old man was very good at vibing people out, too.
If Massarone's up to something I'll pick it up.
You piece of shit. I don't believe this.
Hold on.
Yeah.
I just wanted to thank you for taking the components out of the home theater.
Hey, I bought that for us to watch movies as a family, okay?
Not to entertain your girlfriends.
I talked to my lawyer about filing a separation agreement.
I'm not paying a lawyer.
We should be able to settle this thing like adults!
Then stop taking shit out of the house!
Hey Tony, what's up?
Let's take a walk.
There he is, huh?
Hey, how you doing?
Good, good. How are you doing?
Okay.
Everything all right?
Yeah, watch the curb.
Hey, wait a second. Before you say anything,
have you lost a little weight?
You think, huh? I don't know.
Listen, I talked to our friend. The one that celebrates Hanukkah?
It's in the works.
Oh great, it's good news. Thank you.
Yeah. Yeah.
So I been meaning to ask you
you noticed anything lately?
What are we talking about?
You weren't followed here, were you?
No, l... I don't think so. I'm... I'm pretty careful.
All right.
Everything else okay,
good EKG and shit, huh?
Yeah, I guess.
All right.
But I gotta tell you, I don't like what I'm hearing.
Relax.
It's not worth losing your hair over.
Right?
Okay.
All right.
I couldn't tell shit. What the fuck am I, a mind reader?
So what's the next step here, Ton'?
What?
Said I looked like I lost some weight.
The motherfucker.
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Take it easy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hold on.
That Korean... Kim. Something about your cousin... I don't know.
Yeah?
It's your fucking linen truck. What do you want me to do about it?
Yeah, yeah, it's okay. Fire him. Go ahead.
Put him out in the fucking street for all I care!
If Tony B wants to pick up some scratch...
he could do this Massarone thing... if it goes.
What the fuck is wrong with you?! The man is trying to go straight.
Don't you give a fuck about your cousin?!
I'm sorry, T. You're right.
That was a great party the other night.
Fuck him.
Guy is fucking useless to me.
Was that a yes on Massarone?
Tony's got his own process.
What's to process here?
Honestly, Carm, this is a lot better than watching "Casablanca."
I didn't need to see that movie again anyway.
Even if it kills Tony, I will have that system back for next time.
So what is next on that list?
Number three... "The Godfather."
Look at us. We'll kill ourselves for these cigarettes.
You know they had a bear back here?
So how come Angie Bonpensiero don't come?
Please. She's not welcome here.
I thought everybody liked her.
Don't you know about Pussy?
He went in the program. He turned on everybody...
us, the people he knew his whole life.
Who knows why people do what they do?
But what kind of person does that?
I mean it's like Judas or something,
eating that last supper with Jesus.
And the whole time he knows they're gonna crucify him.
I mean, at least Judas didn't go into any apostle protection program.
He hung himself. He knew what he did.
Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
I didn't know it was that cold, sweetie.
I'll tell you, I don't know how I'd be holding up. It's just...
I guess you all are really important to me.
Aw, Carm, you'd do the same.
We love you so much.
Ade, you okay?
What's the matter?
I'm not what you think.
I don't know what to do.
I need...I wanna tell you all something.
It's driving me crazy.
You know you can tell us anything.
She's been drinking like crazy.
Where are you going?
Honey!
I'm fine, okay? Just leave me alone.
No, you're bleeding. Let me drive you.
Ton'? It's like 3:00 in the morning.
Yeah, yeah. I couldn't sleep so I wanted to see if the phone worked.
Well, yeah, it works great.
I'm in my mother's basement and I can really hear you.
Listen, you should know that...that boss there, Kim,
he's after your ass.
I rub him the wrong way.
Maybe you shouldn't be a masseuse then.
Tony, the reason I called, about the other day...
look, you can kid around with me, okay?
But not when the other guys are there.
I gotta maintain respect.
No, I know. You're the boss.
See you gotta be careful what you say on this phone.
It doesn't affect you, but it affects me.
Right. I'm sorry.
Is everything good over there?
You know, my mom's on my case.
Who'd have thought we'd both be on our own again?
Well, you can get back together with Carm if you want.
'Course she thinks it's up to her and she goes from zero to bitch every time
I try to show any warmth, you know?
That's gotta be tough.
Listen, Tony, I gotta be up in two hours.
So go to sleep.
But you're my cousin and my best friend.
You gotta know we could always talk.
Yeah, well I'll buy a fucking lunch box.
All right, go to sleep, go to sleep.
We gotta talk about my compensation overall.
Interferon for my son's MS? That's 20 a year now.
Right. You said you were gonna get us a making
ceremony which you didn't do.
And here you are asking for a raise.
Can't you talk to the higher-ups?
Okay, we made Vito Spatafore
as running Ralph Cifaretto's construction business.
Has Chris ever confirmed that?
You wanna know something?
What?
This girl, she's totally ripping off her employer.
Probably over 100 grand.
What do you mean?
Tina Francesco's her name.
She's a bookkeeper for this furniture wholesaler.
So she makes up vendors, but she writes them real checks.
Then her father cashes them. Is that a federal crime?
How many checks? I mean, how much?
Like I said, probably over 100 grand.
Tina?
Francesco.
The father's name's Victor.
