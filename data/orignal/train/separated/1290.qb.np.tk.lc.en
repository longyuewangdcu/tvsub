i won &apos;t let you down ! you can count on me !
thank you ! thank you so much !
yes !
yes !
yes ! oh ! yes !
life is good ! oh , yeah !
go , lianne ! uh @-@ huh !
life is good !
this is terrible .
oh , my god , jane .
don &apos;t panic .
too late .
i need to see it again .
wait , no .
too much screen time is bad for you .
take a break . go cut open a body .
okay , they said your apartment burned down
because of faulty wiring .
they did .
but this is arson .
it was .
and you &apos;re not worried ?
somebody picked my very good lock .
look , if -- if they wanted to hurt me ,
they would have broken in when i was home .
and these are the thoughts that give you comfort ?
yeah .
so , what about the hacking ?
or the -- the damage to your credit
or the accounts being closed ?
they are open again , and i have a shiny , new credit card .
maura ...
jane , someone burned down your apartment !
yes . and then they told me about it .
okay , so , what else are they gonna tell you about ?
well , i don &apos;t know , maura , but i &apos;m sure it &apos;s gonna be worse .
isn &apos;t that what you &apos;re thinking ? &apos; cause that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .
that &apos;s what i lay awake thinking about every night !
okay , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry , jane .
i did not -- i did not mean to upset you .
no , i &apos;m already upset .
but i &apos;m not gonna quit my job . then the bad guy wins .
this is just ...
it &apos;s a horrible burden on you .
i ... i &apos;m sure for angela .
no . no , no , no , no , no , no ,
she can &apos;t know anything about this .
well , you have to tell her .
no , i don &apos;t .
and neither do you . and you &apos;re not going to .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m showing you this now so you can get ready .
well , i can &apos;t lie .
yes , you can .
that &apos;s the beauty of the new you .
i can try .
i have confidence in you .
isles .
on my way .
homicide .
hey , h @-@ hold the elevator ! i &apos;ll get my jacket !
well , you &apos;re not going anywhere .
what ?
start pulling files of anybody that may have a beef with you .
okay , i can do that when we get back .
you put a lot of people away . it &apos;ll be a big pile .
korsak , i don &apos;t need to --
stop . desk . go .
this is interesting .
last thing i expected to hear here .
what would you expect ?
sad story .
well , this is interesting and sad .
she &apos;s got track marks , but they &apos;re old .
scars have healed .
it &apos;s possible she stopped using some months ago .
what &apos;s that ?
a tattoo of a butterfly .
beautiful . and it &apos;s recent .
junkie gets clean ,
comes here , tries to start a new life .
gets a hopeful tattoo , falls off the wagon .
well , it &apos;s a quick and violent death .
the foaming around the mouth indicates a drug overdose ,
probably from cocaine .
well , she had plenty of cash for a party .
there wasn &apos;t one , though .
there were no drugs , no paraphernalia .
and no cocaine residue around the nose .
perhaps she was injecting someplace
the supervisors of the halfway house wouldn &apos;t notice .
hey , doc , could you give me an estimate of the victim &apos;s shoe size ?
7 .
that &apos;s a man &apos;s 12 .
maybe he brought the party .
let &apos;s find out who was here .
and not invite him to my party .
almost done .
she said that half an hour ago .
maybe i &apos;ll save time and write out my 10 @-@ page paper by hand .
can you do that when you &apos;re unconscious ?
jane , i found something interesting .
yeah , me too .
people are impatient .
what &apos;s all this ?
uh , korsak &apos;s having me print up
all the threatening e @-@ mails i &apos;ve received .
that &apos;s a lot .
yeah , and this is just from this year .
trying to figure out how to sort them --
chronological order , type of threat ...
overuse of block letters .
when you &apos;re done , meet me in bric .
okay .
it &apos;s all yours .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;ve been working on the video your apartment arsonist sent .
ooh , does it end differently ?
kind of .
really ?
okay , i &apos;m listening .
digital cameras shoot raw images .
they &apos;re high @-@ quality , uncompressed files ,
which the camera &apos;s software edits into a standard frame .
that &apos;s what you see in the image viewer ,
but the full image still exists .
if you can access the raw data ,
you can see outside the frame .
isn &apos;t that cheating ?
yeah . that &apos;s why it &apos;s fun .
watch .
that &apos;s the standard image .
here &apos;s the raw .
you &apos;re amazing .
okay , run a search on
all arsonists with butterfly tattoos .
i already did . nothing came up .
okay , let &apos;s get this to every local tattoo artist .
if we can find the artist , they can lead us to the arsonist .
wait , is that lianne sampson ? what ?
uh , the victim from the scene i just came from .
she died of a drug overdose .
she had a tattoo of a butterfly on her left wrist .
that &apos;s my murder victim .
no , that &apos;s my murder victim .
this threatening pile of e @-@ mails is all from women .
there &apos;s no lianne sampson .
anything mention arson or hacking ?
maybe she used a different name .
i have a &quot; you &apos;re dead , bitch . &quot;
&quot; dead &quot; is spelled d @-@ e @-@ d .
i feel pretty good about eliminating her .
yeah .
as a suspect or a spelling @-@ bee contestant .
well , you don &apos;t need to be a good speller
to burn something down .
no , but you do need some degree of competence
if you &apos;re gonna hack into all my accounts .
she could have hired somebody to do that .
yeah .
lianne sampson was paroled two months ago
for petty theft .
petty theft .
lots of petty theft .
no , i &apos;ve never had any contact with this woman .
throwaway kid in and out of group homes ,
becomes a drug @-@ addicted adult .
but she &apos;s been sober for the last six months .
not so sure about that .
part of her parole was that she was tested every week .
as of last thursday , she was clean .
what &apos;s her connection to jane ?
there is none . she burned down my apartment .
yeah , there &apos;s that .
we &apos;ll keep looking .
okay . maybe somebody hired her .
would explain all the cash in her apartment .
a junkie will do a lot for 5 grand .
yeah . yeah , i like that thinking .
i mean , i don &apos;t like that thinking .
i got it .
okay .
nina just cracked lianne &apos;s phone .
there are lots of texts from a tom hobert .
every other word is &quot; baby . &quot;
so he was her boyfriend .
oh , yeah . there are months of these .
but they end four weeks ago .
oh , right before she torched my apartment .
okay .
so , we need to talk to mr. hobert .
it &apos;s maura .
okay , i &apos;ll be right down .
‭ we &apos;ll take care of hobert .
okay , thanks .
you have an address for this hobert ?
working on it .
you rang ?
ish .
i have a surprise for you .
oh , no , dr. frankenstein , you shouldn &apos;t have .
the fire inspector
still had your door in the evidence locker .
i was thinking about what you said
about having a very good lock , so i brought it here ,
and you did , and it was picked .
well , they had to get in somehow .
the teeth are even .
they bumped my lock ?
they struck the lock .
they withdrew . they repeated .
they struck again until all of the tumblers were open .
this is a very sophisticated lock @-@ picking technique .
which rules out a drug addict with no b &amp; e priors .
yeah , but we &apos;re dealing with
someone smart and motivated , jane .
i &apos;m worried about you .
i &apos;d worry about the person who bumped my lock when i find them .
jane ...
nobody bumps my lock , maura .
thanks for coming .
i &apos;m kind of curious why
you didn &apos;t want jane to know i was here .
i &apos;ve drawn up a psychological profile
on the person who &apos;s after her .
the arsonist ?
the person who hired the arsonist
and possibly the hacker .
you &apos;ve ruled out lianne sampson ?
yes .
so , this individual has access to money .
they &apos;re very good at manipulating people ,
very smart , and very unpredictable .
you think jane &apos;s in danger ?
i think jane needs a bodyguard ,
which i will pay for myself .
have you told her that ?
no .
look , maura ...
i understand your concern . i share your concern .
excellent . so , this is the list of
bodyguards that come highly recommended .
they killed lianne sampson .
yes , and jane is my best chance of finding them .
i &apos;m not taking her out of commission .
that would be counterproductive .
thank you .
how did you meet lianne ?
we started dating in rehab .
you &apos;re not supposed to date people from rehab .
you &apos;re not supposed to step on a crack
&apos;cause you &apos;ll break your mother &apos;s back , but you do .
we were good together , you know ?
she was an all @-@ right chick .
then what ?
there was a new guy , some dick .
but with money .
boyfriend ?
lianne said she was working for him .
you didn &apos;t believe her ?
she wouldn &apos;t tell me what she was doing for the money .
she wouldn &apos;t even tell me his name .
did she tell you what he did or how he looked or where he lived ?
no .
not a curious guy , are you ?
doesn &apos;t matter , all the details .
she was gonna start using again .
you know what you call an ex @-@ junkie with cash ?
a junkie .
hobert ?
this was fun . let &apos;s not do it again .
hi , ma . what &apos;s up ?
you tell me .
i do not have the time for this today .
something wrong ?
no , nothing &apos;s wrong . i &apos;m just busy .
uh , y @-@ you didn &apos;t call me .
i &apos;m sorry .
uh , i @-@ i didn &apos;t know that you called .
jane , you know what the silver cord is ?
if i pull it , will you disappear so i can go back to work ?
ah , you &apos;re funny , jane .
no , it &apos;s the connection between
a mother and her child that &apos;s always there .
right .
yes , i remember seeing something about that on a show ...
or a birthday card .
mm . it lets a mother know when there &apos;s trouble -- like now .
there &apos;s no trouble .
no ?
no .
it &apos;s maura . it &apos;s important . i got to go .
yeah , sure .
okay , i &apos;ll just worry for the both of us .
okay .
i love you .
i love you , too , ma .
there were five balloons of cocaine
in lianne sampson &apos;s stomach .
so she was a mule ?
maybe .
no room for &quot; maybe . &quot;
i took pictures of the balloons , and i had them blown up .
unusual .
all five balloons had
a perfectly cylindrical puncture under the lip .
so they were supposed to leak ?
yes .
well , there are easier ,
less @-@ expensive ways to kill someone .
it appears the person who killed her doesn &apos;t care about money .
that &apos;s strange . especially for drug dealers .
even stranger , there was a sixth balloon with less cocaine ,
but it made room for the watch .
&quot; the watch &quot; ?
a small watch for a girl or a woman ,
and the battery was removed .
so it could be set for a specific time .
5 : 26 .
doesn &apos;t tell us much .
well , it &apos;s within a half @-@ hour of my estimated time of death .
it &apos;s clever , but still ...
there &apos;s also a date -- the 26th .
that &apos;s tomorrow .
and this is my watch .
we have until 5 : 26 p.m. tomorrow .
finding whoever killed lianne sampson
is your first priority .
it &apos;s your only priority .
this watch is a ticking clock .
non @-@ ticking clock .
it &apos;s a message .
whoever put this in lianne sampson &apos;s stomach
wanted us to find it .
nina ?
detective rizzoli &apos;s apartment burned down .
then someone accessed her financials ,
but they didn &apos;t steal anything .
they just used that crime to send us a video ,
which showed that the apartment fire was arson .
lianne sampson is murdered ,
and we &apos;re given a watch with a time and a date .
every piece of this , we &apos;ve been one step behind .
that stops right now .
nobody goes home . nobody sleeps .
every lead , every thought , every whisper comes through me .
that clear ? is that clear ?
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
i am not gonna be pushed out of
an investigation that involves me .
it &apos;s because it involves you that you can &apos;t be involved .
that doesn &apos;t even make sense .
look , i can &apos;t conduct an investigation
into whoever &apos;s targeting you
and keep you safe from them at the same time !
i never asked you to keep me safe !
well , you should !
this guy is willing to kill an accomplice
just to leave a clue as to what might happen next !
which could be anything !
it &apos;s your watch , jane !
excuse me . we &apos;re in the middle of something here , all right ?
so is he .
detective jane rizzoli , this is your bodyguard .
boris martin .
oh , come on !
normally , a cop &apos;s in danger ,
i put them in protective custody .
whoever &apos;s targeting you -- they &apos;re anticipating normal .
the department is paying for a bodyguard ? !
you have a bodyguard . focus on what &apos;s important .
nice to meet you .
take her home , mr. martin .
oh , come on !
really ?
hi , gary .
tell me about your living arrangements .
i , uh , live with my brother .
it &apos;s temporary .
well , he &apos;ll have to move till this is over .
finally , some good news .
you okay ?
yeah , fine .
look , you don &apos;t have to save jane by yourself .
you didn &apos;t have to pay for that bodyguard .
tell me -- tell me how the , um , investigation &apos;s going .
well , i @-@ i questioned every resident in that halfway house ,
and it &apos;s just like the scummy ex @-@ boyfriend said .
lianne sampson had a new guy , but no one &apos;s seen him .
he &apos;s a ghost , so dead end .
oh , a @-@ and the balloons
that you pulled out of lianne &apos;s stomach ...
... are from a shoe store that closed down eight years ago .
i @-@ i keep running headfirst into a wall
and hoping the wall gives .
well , you &apos;re doing the best that you can .
that &apos;s not enough .
he could still get to jane .
no , he won &apos;t .
yeah , but he might .
i have to figure out something else to do ,
but i don &apos;t know what that is yet .
‭ i don &apos;t know . maybe , um ...
maybe he &apos;s not a he .
maybe .
wait .
yeah .
if that &apos;s true , there &apos;s one place i haven &apos;t checked yet .
thank you .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
what are you doing ?
uh , i was just cleaning out the room for you .
just one more trip , i should be done .
thank you ?
i can protect you better in there .
what , from light , from air ?
someone is trying to disrupt
your normal patterns of behavior --
where you live , how you spend , how you work .
in this apartment ,
i can create a bulwark of stability and predictability .
huh , just what i &apos;ve always wanted .
this will pass .
i &apos;ll make sure you &apos;re around to achieve your dreams ,
whatever those are .
‭ thanks . i appreciate that .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m making my dreams of a pizza a reality .
it was thwarted earlier today .
no deliveries .
but i &apos;m hungry .
i &apos;ll cook .
pizza ?
dreams die hard .
frankie !
hiya , son .
hey , ma .
hey , i , uh ... i got to go .
i thought your shift was over ?
something came up .
something with jane ?
i can &apos;t talk about it .
i do have a gun .
so ?
ma ...
someone &apos;s after jane , but it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m on it . we &apos;re all on it .
you all right ?
yeah .
yeah , i @-@ i &apos;m okay .
i got to go .
there &apos;s nothing good in here .
don &apos;t read the front page . go to sports .
i started with sports .
how &apos;s the pizza coming ?
it &apos;s been over 15 minutes . it should be free .
grilled moroccan chicken .
it smells like angels .
i hope you like it . it was simple , really .
i found a chicken breast in the fridge
and combined some spices from the pantry .
it tastes like ...
i don &apos;t want to say that i would eat an angel .
but if it tasted like this , i could live with myself .
thank you !
you &apos;re welcome . i love to cook .
this job is so unpredictable -- the hours , the personalities .
i like the measured predictability of cooking .
i like it , too -- very much .
jane ?
who is it ?
very dangerous . don &apos;t let her in .
jane ?
who is it ?
my mother .
hello ? jane ?
who are you ? !
i can &apos;t protect you .
open up !
hi . come on in .
i &apos;m boris , a work friend of jane &apos;s .
hi . angela rizzoli . nice to meet ya .
hi , ma !
hi .
i know you got that work thing going on ,
so i just came to drop this off .
i thought you might be hungry .
yes ! we are .
thank you .
it smells fantastic .
lasagna -- my mother &apos;s recipe .
it &apos;ll make that six @-@ pack into a five .
i &apos;m in . i like her .
oh , i @-@ i do , too .
ah , so , i @-@ i &apos;m sure you -- you have a few questions .
about what ?
oh , about that secret work @-@ operation thing ?
n @-@ no , i &apos;ve learned it &apos;s none of my business .
r @-@ really ? well , um ,
&apos;cause -- &apos; cause , you know , everything &apos;s fine .
oh , well , i figured .
oh . yeah , um , you good ?
good .
she &apos;s good ?
great .
everything &apos;s good !
okay , so , you can put that in the fridge
and heat that up later , and jane ?
it &apos;ll go very nicely with a glass of red wine ...
and don &apos;t forget the napkins .
yes , ma &apos;am .
‭ can &apos;t wait to try the lasagna .
yeah , good .
boris , work friend of jane
if something happens to my daughter , i &apos;ll kill you dead .
now , give a kiss to mama .
give it up .
is she gone ?
yeah .
she really is something , though , isn &apos;t she ?
yes , she is .
you didn &apos;t answer the question .
what was the question ?
how is this you staying out of the investigation ?
because i &apos;m not asking about the murder .
you &apos;re asking about people who might be following you .
nina ...
tell her .
i pulled bpd surveillance footage from before the fire ,
like you asked .
the same guy was right behind you when you left bpd --
twice .
send me a screenshot .
just did -- to your phone .
he works in the building .
his name is frank conte . he &apos;s a good guy .
sorry , just --
grasping at straws ?
it &apos;s all right . we all are .
get some sleep , okay ?
i plan to -- around 5 : 27 .
if she asks about anything more ,
you might want to let korsak know .
sure .
i figured .
so , you don &apos;t know of any women who knew lianne sampson ?
i wish i could be of more help .
my interaction with individual inmates is limited ,
unless their stay here is problematic .
lianne sampson was a model prisoner .
but here &apos;s the man who can help .
hi . joe harris , prison psychiatrist .
detective frank rizzoli .
joe , please assist the detective any way you can .
you can talk here .
thanks .
i , uh ... i heard about lianne &apos;s death .
tragic . she seemed to be on such a good path .
uh , she was your patient ?
yeah , more for counseling than anything .
she wanted guidance on how to live a better life .
and you gave that to her ?
it &apos;s part of an inmate &apos;s preparation for release
if they request it .
i listened .
i helped her let go of her past ,
steered her towards books and support groups .
then she was gone .
did lianne have any regular visitors ?
you can check the logs but none that i know of .
ties to any guards ?
no .
and what about other inmates ?
no , lianne stayed mostly to herself .
she had been here before .
she was determined never to come back again .
uh , one more thing .
did she ever mention a detective rizzoli ?
no .
but why would she mention you ?
no reason .
thanks for your time .
sure .
thank you all for your cooperation .
we &apos;ll get you back in your apartments as soon as we can .
i have an area set up over here .
they &apos;re moving frankie &apos;s neighbors .
gonna be so popular in this building .
get away from the window .
hey . my phone died .
what are you doing ?
charging your phone with my car .
this car has a special feature --
yeah , i &apos;m so glad . tell me about it later .
bomb @-@ sniffing dog .
sure everyone feels safe now .
window !
all right !
circle around the back .
how you doing ?
now i know what a prisoner feels like .
yeah , time goes slow when there &apos;s nothing to do .
be over soon .
i &apos;ve got 5 : 25 .
me too .
me three .
where &apos;s korsak ?
5 : 27 .
yep .
jane ...
and that &apos;s correct . i synch to greenwich mean time .
in an hour , i think we can have you out of here .
but i don &apos;t want you leaving the ap--
wait a minute .
the numbers are digital .
yeah ?
they look like letters .
or a code .
whoa , whoa , whoa , where are you going ?
no , no , no , i got to get to bpd .
no . the watch is not a clock .
it &apos;s not a clock . i got to get to bpd .
jane !
i &apos;m on my way .
whoa , whoa . wh-- hey .
no . no , no , no , no , no , no !
korsak , i got to get to the station .
back inside .
no , listen to me .
526 , okay ? it &apos;s -- it &apos;s -- it &apos;s a message .
nothing this man has done has been straightforward , all right ?
when he burned down my apartment ,
he didn &apos;t leave a message .
he left it buried in some computer file
that nina had to find , okay ?
the watch is not a ticking clock !
what is this -- a mixed metaphor ?
a simile ? i &apos;m a little tired for wordplay .
5 @-@ 2 @-@ 6 .
it &apos;s not a time . it &apos;s a code or a message .
okay , i &apos;ll get everybody to work on that .
would you please escort her back upstairs ?
no ! kors-- wait a minute !
hold up , hold up .
no ! listen to me !
it is a message , and it is a message for me !
please !
it &apos;s 5 : 29 .
he &apos;ll be expecting her guard down .
please .
all right , let &apos;s get her back to the station .
she &apos;s the worst client ever .
what do you see ?
somebody ...
trying to rip apart my life .
what do you think the watch means ?
526 -- street address on 26th street ?
maybe an area code ?
well , then what does the 26 stand for ?
there &apos;s no 526.26th street in boston .
surprise .
code for a safe ?
but where &apos;s the safe ?
could be map coordinates .
or it could be nothing .
there &apos;s got to be something to this --
all this work , a woman killed to set a deadline .
which passed , and then nothing happened .
how do we know nothing &apos;s happened , frankie ?
nobody &apos;s told us anything .
all right , quit throwing up roadblocks .
you don &apos;t want to be here , then don &apos;t be here !
i &apos;ll follow up on all these combinations of 526 and 26 .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna grab a coffee . you want anything ?
no , thanks .
hey , ma !
hi .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
not even a sip ?
something &apos;s up .
this whole thing with jane , it ...
no , i shouldn &apos;t . forget about it .
no , you should .
you should talk about it because if you don &apos;t , i will .
and if i start , i &apos;m never stopping .
i &apos;ve been taking every available shift
just to keep my mind off of it .
jane doesn &apos;t realize how worried i am about her .
well , you don &apos;t know how to be when you &apos;re scared for jane .
exactly .
and jane doesn &apos;t know how to be when she &apos;s scared for jane .
yeah .
look , you &apos;re all under a lot of pressure .
i got to go .
i &apos;m on triple platinum overtime from all these shifts .
finish your beer , relax , and then just get back at it .
i &apos;ll trade you for a cup of coffee .
you got it .
you look tired .
you want to rest on my couch ? i can go work in the lab .
no , no , no .
i &apos;ll just lay here and think .
about ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
hate letters and ...
revenge e @-@ mails and ...
arson and hacking and murder and a watch and ...
i don &apos;t know .
well , take a guess .
don &apos;t be me .
i just don &apos;t know if it &apos;s worth it , you know ?
putting together the clues ?
no . the -- the job .
your job ?
yeah , just ...
... the stress of it all for everybody , you know ?
me .
ma , frankie .
don &apos;t you ever feel like doing something else ?
something that doesn &apos;t involve dead bodies ?
sure , i &apos;d like to get an engineering degree
and work for elon musk on spacex .
or move to maine and write mystery novels .
sometimes i imagine being the person who makes up
the names for colors in the j.crew catalogues .
you know ...
faded ebony
or dusty cobblestone , neon persimmon .
you ?
no , i can &apos;t think of any other life .
well , that &apos;s not true .
it is .
i mean , i could always see more red sox games , but ...
i can do that now with better planning .
you &apos;re in the middle of a crisis .
and contrary to the world view
of romance novels or elizabeth gilbert ,
right now is not a good time to make decisions .
who &apos;s elizabeth gilbert ?
&quot; eat , pray , love . &quot;
oh , god .
maybe it would help if you lean into the discomfort .
in the same way you lean into your stilettos ?
yes .
except for , the leaning in you &apos;re about to do
doesn &apos;t make your butt look great .
it doesn &apos;t make anything look great .
okay .
i will let you get back to work .
no , jane . come on . stay .
no , i &apos;m good .
jane ?
i &apos;m okay .
really .
what are you doing ?
everything else is in the past .
so is the watch .
yeah , but it means something with the 5 @-@ 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 2 @-@ 6 .
5 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 6 ?
5 @-@ 2 @-@ 6 .
dash 2 ...
