listening to his closing argument ,
i almost want to let him go myself ,
except for one thing-- he &apos;s a liar .
he thinks he doesn &apos;t have to play by the same rules .
but we know he does .
what did you do ?
i pled guilty .
if you think i &apos;m gonna let you do this ,
you &apos;re out of your goddamn mind .
he cut a deal to save this firm .
he cut a deal to keep us from going to prison .
we give evan people who already want to go ,
and i give anita gibbs murderers in exchange for mike .
and what if it doesn &apos;t work and we lose everything ?
then we do . but if we don &apos;t try to save him , who are we ?
make the deal .
i am not letting you go to prison
for a crime that i committed .
i &apos;m not letting you go when you &apos;re gonna be found innocent !
why the hell would you lie to me ?
&apos;cause the truth would &apos;ve broken you .
you know what , harvey ?
you want to come to my wedding , you let me know .
i &apos;m not trying to take your place anymore .
i &apos;m trying to get you ready because you &apos;re weak .
harvey , i am not weak .
yeah ? well , hit me .
is this what you want ?
that i hate you and that you made me do this ?
we lose everything because of you !
i am not saying that i don &apos;t want to get married .
you go finish law school .
and then in two years , when i get out ,
if you still want to marry me ...
they &apos;re all gone .
watch your back in there , mike .
i will .
general wake @-@ up for all inmates is at 6 : 00 a.m.
you will be standing next to your bed at that time .
if you are not , you will face disciplinary action .
at least five inmate counts
will be held during each 24 @-@ hour period at random times .
you will stand still during every one of those counts .
if you are not , you will face disciplinary action .
you will be at meals on time if you want to eat .
you will be at work on time , no matter what .
you will keep your cell in a clean and sanitary condition .
if you fail in any of these areas , you will face ...
disciplinary action .
good . you &apos;re getting the picture .
do you mind if i ask what disciplinary action means ?
since you got the balls to ask that ,
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re gonna find out soon enough .
what &apos;s this for ?
what do you think it &apos;s for ?
strip naked , put everything you own inside that bag ,
then follow me .
harvey , what are you doing here ?
i came to let you know that i dropped him off ,
and , um , he looks as good as he could look .
and i think he &apos;s gonna be okay .
i appreciate that .
but you could have told me that over the phone .
so what are you really doing here ?
i miss him .
i miss him too .
where the hell are you going ?
where do you think i &apos;m going ?
i &apos;m going home , louis .
look , don &apos;t you get it ?
they &apos;re all gone-- every single one of them .
yeah , well , we knew that already .
no , no , i don &apos;t think you understand .
i &apos;m not just talking about the partners .
i &apos;m talking about everyone , from the accountants
to the secretaries to the guy who shines my shoes , donna .
all of them , gone .
and what exactly do you want me to do about it ?
i want you to get harvey on the goddamn phone .
well , i &apos;m not gonna do that .
why not ?
because tonight &apos;s not the night to call harvey .
why , because of mike ?
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve noticed , but mike is gone ,
along with everybody else .
and if we don &apos;t figure something out by tonight ,
we are gonna be left with nothing .
i didn &apos;t say we weren &apos;t gonna figure something out , louis .
i said we &apos;re not calling harvey .
well , then what the hell are we gonna do ?
right now i &apos;m gonna go to my office
and fix myself a goddamn drink .
the first time i met him ?
what do you think i thought ? i ...
i thought he was an idiot .
imagine how i felt
when a bunch of weed spilled out of his briefcase
ten seconds after he walked into his interview .
i know . you were so horrified , you got on the phone ,
and you called the police .
no , wait . you didn &apos;t do that .
you offered the idiot a job .
that &apos;s because after i heard his story ,
i knew he wasn &apos;t an idiot after all .
and i knew by the end of that first morning
that he wasn &apos;t like anyone i &apos;d ever met ,
and that if i wasn &apos;t careful , i was gonna be in trouble .
to trouble .
to trouble .
look at that . louis left me a voice mail .
i don &apos;t understand . you seem happy about that .
that &apos;s because one of my favorite pastimes
is to listen to one of louis &apos;s messages .
what if he &apos;s upset about something ?
he &apos;s always upset about something .
that &apos;s why one of my favorite pastimes
is to listen to one of louis &apos;s messages .
damn it , harvey , pick up the goddamn phone ,
because this entire firm is a ghost town ,
and i &apos;m sorry mike &apos;s in prison ,
but if we don &apos;t figure something out ,
what you and your little sidekick did
is gonna be the end of us .
and don &apos;t give me some bullshit about tonight isn &apos;t the time ,
because--
i got to go .
yeah , i know . i &apos;m coming with you .
rachel , you heard what louis said .
this is gonna be a rough night . you need to stay here .
harvey , it &apos;s gonna be a rough night no matter where i am .
and at least if i &apos;m with you ,
there &apos;s a chance that i could be of some use .
you better get your coat , because we don &apos;t have much time .
now what ?
now you get dressed , and you wait .
would you like some more drinks ?
can i offer you an appetizer , maybe some truffle fries ,
or are we allowed to talk business now ?
all right , louis , what do you think we should do ,
since it was your recommendation
that landed us in this mess in the first place ?
i recommended that because it was a last @-@ ditch effort
to get mike out of prison .
and you also said we &apos;d only lose 50 %
of our partners to evan smith .
how could i have known that she had the capacity
to bring on more than that ?
don &apos;t you get it ? the rest didn &apos;t go to evan smith .
they just walked the hell out and went somewhere else .
then we can sue their asses .
with what lawyers , what resources , and what money ?
because i don &apos;t know if you noticed ,
but this firm has been gutted because of your recommendation .
no , jessica , it was gutted because of mine .
damn it , louis . i told you not to call him .
well , i did . because he &apos;s a partner ,
and like he just said , he was the one
who wanted to sever the noncompetes in the first place .
you &apos;re right , louis . i did .
but i didn &apos;t come down here
to play pin the blame on the harvey .
i came down here to figure out what the hell we &apos;re gonna do .
then let &apos;s get to it .
may i help you ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry to interrupt ,
but there was no one at reception ,
and i have your order here .
you got to be kidding me .
you call me down here for an emergency ,
and then you take the time to order chinese food ?
i didn &apos;t order anything , asshole .
so you crouch your tiger , hide your dragon ,
or i &apos;m gonna wang chung your ass out of here .
louis , calm down . clearly , there &apos;s some mistake .
no one at this firm has ordered any food .
well , i &apos;m pretty sure this is the right place ,
because the name on your door says jessica pearson ,
and this order is for a jessica pearson .
yeah this is jessica pearson .
louis !
what ?
they know i &apos;m not really here
to bring you an egg roll , asshole .
i &apos;m here to serve you with this .
what is that ?
it &apos;s a class action .
we &apos;re being sued for every case mike ross has ever touched .
that &apos;s why they all left .
they knew this was coming , and they got out
so they could all have it on record
that they were gone before the suit came down .
then we need to know who the hell tipped them off .
it doesn &apos;t matter who tipped them off .
what matters is , if we lose this suit ,
we can &apos;t handle the money .
how much are they suing us for ?
$ 100 million .
god damn it .
we need to get those partners back .
i told you , we &apos;re never gonna get them back .
and right now we don &apos;t even know where they went .
i do .
how the hell did you pull that off ?
because lawyers don &apos;t talk to lawyers ,
but secretaries talk to secretaries .
that is a list of who went where .
okay , we need a paper trail tonight--
notices of breach of contract--
and we need to get on record
that those partners aren &apos;t off the hook .
it &apos;s too late to send out notices .
we already got served with the lawsuit .
he didn &apos;t record the time .
donna , there &apos;s $ 5,000 in the cigar box on my desk .
get it now .
wait . where the hell are you going ?
i &apos;m going downstairs
to tell that server he can have every nickel of it
to say he didn &apos;t deliver that thing for another two hours .
assuming harvey doesn &apos;t shit the bed ,
we &apos;ve got two hours to figure out
how we &apos;re gonna serve every partner on this list .
give me that list .
they can consider themselves served ,
because louis marlowe litt never backs down from a fight .
federal correctional institution , danbury .
yes , i &apos;m--i &apos;m calling to check on an--
inmate ?
yeah . his name is michael ross , and he--
i &apos;m sorry , ma &apos;am .
i can &apos;t give out information regarding inmates .
would you at least be able to tell me
if he &apos;s been processed yet ?
if he surrendered himself ,
then he has been processed .
okay , so does that mean that he &apos;s in a cell now or--
ma &apos;am , i &apos;m a prison administrator , not a hotel concierge .
i don &apos;t know the whereabouts of any given inmate at any given time .
okay , would you be able to tell me when i can see him ?
are you his spouse or immediate family ?
no .
then you &apos;ll have to go through the approval process .
but he doesn &apos;t have any immediate family ,
and i &apos;m his fiancée .
and unless you have a filed marriage certificate ,
you &apos;ll have to wait till next month .
next month ?
look , am i--am i allowed to ask your name ?
my name is ruth .
ruth , mike and i were ...
supposed to be married today , but we weren &apos;t .
and i can &apos;t stop thinking about him ,
and i &apos;m not gonna be able to sleep
unless i know that he &apos;s gonna be okay .
he &apos;s in prison , ma &apos;am .
i really couldn &apos;t say .
i am sorry .
nothing like prison blue to make you realize
the clothes don &apos;t make the man , huh ?
warden clark ?
me ?
no .
who told you you were going to meet the warden ?
uh , no one . i @-@ i just thought--
that this was going to be like a prison movie .
都出自 《 肖申克的救赎 》
&quot; put your trust in the lord ,
but your ass belongs to me &quot; type shit .
you know &quot; shawshank &quot; ?
of course you know &quot; shawshank . &quot;
you work in a prison .
no , brother , i know &quot; shawshank &quot;
because it &apos;s the greatest movie ever made . here ...
what &apos;s this ?
your psychological evaluation .
why do i need a psychological evaluation ?
because the federal penitentiary system says you do .
now , when i get back , if there &apos;s a hole in the mirror
covered by a rita hayworth poster ,
i will not be happy .
okay , louis , calm down .
you &apos;ve had a few misfires , possibly had a stroke ,
but you can do this .
you &apos;ve entered the requisite information .
you calibrated the typeface perfectly .
all you have to do is press &quot; send , &quot;
and those sons of bitches are about to get litt the hell up .
god damn mother--
what the hell are you doing ?
i &apos;m just doing a little troubleshooting . why ?
that is a $ 400,000 piece of hardware ,
and you have no business even--
wait a second . what are you still doing here ?
what any it officer worth his salt would do .
i &apos;m maintaining our system , so it appears we &apos;re still
a functioning law firm to the outside world .
can you electronically serve legal notice
to every partner in the next two hours ?
as long as you &apos;ve got their official business addresses ,
i can do it in the next two minutes .
well , it &apos;s a good thing i have them right here .
um , no offense , but i &apos;m really more of a lone ranger .
excuse me ?
i can get this done in a more efficient manner
without you looking over my shoulder .
well , that &apos;s what i told my mother
when i looked at my first &quot; playboy . &quot;
but it didn &apos;t happen then , and it &apos;s not gonna happen now .
well , that doesn &apos;t matter because ...
we have a problem .
so you &apos;re saying , in this office ,
at any given moment ,
there &apos;s $ 100,000 hidden away .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .
where ?
i &apos;m not telling you .
whatever the hell you two are in the middle of ,
it &apos;s gonna have to wait ,
because secretaries may talk to secretaries ,
but liars talk to idiots .
louis , what the hell are you talking about ?
i &apos;m saying that that list is a bucket of bullshit ,
and the mighty donna paulsen--
she doesn &apos;t know her ass from her elbow .
watch yourself , louis .
i don &apos;t need to watch myself , harvey .
see , i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve noticed ,
but we &apos;re being sued for a $ 100 million .
the partners are gone , and we can &apos;t stop them .
maybe we don &apos;t have to stop them .
what are you saying ?
what i want to know right now is what we &apos;re all worth .
what , are you kidding ?
why don &apos;t you just jam a cattle prod up my ass ?
it would be less invasive .
i &apos;ll jam my fist in your face
if you don &apos;t start getting with the program .
there you go , resorting to violence , like you always do .
because you don &apos;t want to admit this whole thing
is your fault in the first place .
my fault ? if i hadn &apos;t brought mike in ,
you &apos;d still be here sniveling around
like a goddamn junior partner .
and if i hadn &apos;t given donna back to you ,
you &apos;d still be having panic attacks
like a goddamn little girl .
louis !
you smug son of a bitch .
that &apos;s enough !
i just watched the man that i love go to prison
so none of you have to .
and it hasn &apos;t been five minutes ...
and you &apos;re already ripping each other apart .
rachel ...
let me finish .
i thought i wanted to be alone tonight .
and then i realized that i didn &apos;t ,
because i wanted to be with my family .
but if you can &apos;t keep it together tonight ...
of all nights , then as far as i &apos;m concerned ...
you can all rot in hell .
well , i &apos;m gonna say what she won &apos;t .
this is all on you .
louis , this is the last place i wanted to be tonight too ,
but i came back here to save my firm anyway .
but if you &apos;re gonna be the same old louis
and we &apos;re going to do the same old dance ,
then maybe you and this firm can both go rot in hell .
louis , i don &apos;t want to hear it .
well , that &apos;s good , because i &apos;m not here to say it .
are you saying you didn &apos;t come down here
to tell me harvey can go to hell ?
i &apos;m saying i came down here to tell you ,
if harvey wants to go ...
we should let him .
louis .
jessica , you once told me ,
no matter what happens ,
pearson will always consider litt her partner ,
which means whatever happens with harvey ...
we can do this together .
what do you say-- you and me ?
pearson litt .
you say no .
no , louis--
i should have known .
you never wanted me .
all you ever wanted was your precious harvey .
louis , you have no idea what i want .
and my hesitation has nothing to do with you .
then what exactly does it have to do with ?
louis ...
i have put everything i have into keeping this firm afloat
for as long as i can remember .
well , now look around you .
the ship isn &apos;t sinking . it sunk .
and i don &apos;t know if i have it in me
to pull it back up
from the bottom of the ocean .
finally .
excuse me ?
they came and took that thing away three hours ago .
i &apos;ve been sitting here twiddling my thumbs ever since .
you were not twiddling your thumbs .
you were waiting for me to go over the results of that thing .
and the results are you are full of shit .
excuse me ?
you heard me .
i answered every one of those questions honestly .
i didn &apos;t say you didn &apos;t .
well , in that case , i guess you didn &apos;t get the memo .
we &apos;re in a prison filled with con men .
everyone here is full of shit .
and the difference between you and them
is they know they are .
what does that even mean ?
it means that they know they don &apos;t have the patience
to earn what they want ,
and that &apos;s why they go out and steal it from other people .
so that &apos;s why you left me in here all that time ,
just to prove that i have no patience .
evaluation number two , narcissistic tendencies .
the world does not revolve around you .
you know what ? i don &apos;t have to listen to this .
no , you don &apos;t , because my day is done .
and i &apos;m going to go home ,
pour myself a cold beer
while you get settled in cell 42
on the south end of d block .
yeah , i get it .
i &apos;m no longer mike ross .
i &apos;m just inmate number 53296 .
no , you &apos;re still mike ross .
but my job is to help you become a better version of him
when you leave than when you came in .
and if you trust me , that just might happen .
trust you ?
you came in here before acting like you were on my side .
let &apos;s get one thing straight .
i didn &apos;t act anything .
you waltzed in here thinking
this was gonna be like some prison movie .
well , it &apos;s not , so get that through your head .
it &apos;s not a movie , brother .
it &apos;s just prison .
律师事务所
don &apos;t you dare push that button .
you &apos;re not leaving , harvey , not tonight .
yes , i am .
well , if you really mean that ,
then you &apos;re not the man i thought you were .
what did you just say to me ?
i said that underneath that expensive suit
and that perfect record is a coward
ready to run from one of the biggest fights of his life .
i am not running from anything , donna ,
and i don &apos;t need this right now .
no , harvey , right now is exactly when you need this ,
because tomorrow &apos;s gonna be too late .
i know what i &apos;m doing .
then why don &apos;t you enlighten me ?
because i , for one ,
would love to know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
i &apos;m gonna go the hell home and never look back .
and what about tomorrow ?
i don &apos;t care about tomorrow .
well , maybe you should start caring about tomorrow ,
because if you don &apos;t ,
you &apos;re gonna wake up three weeks from now ,
and you &apos;re gonna realize that this
was the biggest mistake of your life ,
and all you did was give up
exactly what mike went to prison to save .
mike did not go to prison to save this goddamn firm .
no , harvey , he went to prison to save us .
and now you &apos;re walking out on us .
and if you &apos;re gonna do that , then tell me ,
what did he save us for ?
let &apos;s get one thing straight .
you waltzed in here thinking
this was gonna be like a prison movie .
well , it &apos;s not .
ross .
it &apos;s not a movie , brother .
it &apos;s just prison .
it &apos;s just prison .
ross .
did you hear me ?
we gonna have trouble your first night ?
no .
then get in there .
one more thing ...
you &apos;re not authorized to leave this cell the rest of the night .
jessica , i &apos;m sorry .
you know , this used to be my desk .
different desk , same spot .
jackson was there , burns was there ,
and kleiman was by the door .
he hated being by the door .
i don &apos;t know any of those names .
because they got out a long time ago ,
because this life isn &apos;t for everyone .
and it &apos;s harder on some than it is on others .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying that ...
for women , the rules are different .
you can &apos;t be everyone &apos;s friend
and invite them to tea because ...
warm means you &apos;re weak .
i wasn &apos;t gonna be weak .
but now the flip side to that is ,
if you &apos;re strong , they think you &apos;re cold .
and that &apos;s why they &apos;re all gone ...
because they see me as ...
as unfeeling and manipulative .
i &apos;m tired of it .
well , they &apos;re wrong .
you &apos;re just saying that
because you &apos;re seeing me like this .
no , that has nothing to do with it .
my dad told me
that the only reason he came to the church today
was because you told him if he didn &apos;t ,
he would lose me forever .
and you didn &apos;t do that
because you were trying to manipulate some situation .
you did it because you care .
and because you did it ,
i will be loyal to you forever .
what can i do for you , harvey ?
i came to tell you that i &apos;m sorry .
you should be .
i know .
so you gonna give me a tongue lashing ,
or you want to figure out how we can get out of this jackpot ?
i think that right now you and me and louis
should get in a room and smoke a peace pipe .
are you saying what i think you &apos;re saying ?
i sure as hell am .
and where exactly are we gonna get that shit
this late at night ?
&apos;cause the coffee cart guy is long gone .
it just so happens
i like to brew my own coffee from time to time .
i &apos;m gonna go get a drink .
that stuff &apos;s illegal , you know .
put that down .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to--
touch my stuff ?
funny , i didn &apos;t see the picture jump into your hands by itself .
look , i was just--
relax , i &apos;m just giving you shit .
that &apos;s my little nephew-- sweet kid ,
dumb as a box of rocks .
welcome to danbury . what &apos;s your name ?
mike . mike ross .
frank gallo .
well , mike , looks like we &apos;re gonna be sharing
this little condo for a while .
feel like telling me what you &apos;re in for ?
i get it . you don &apos;t know if you can trust me .
listen , truth is , you shouldn &apos;t trust anybody in here .
except i just asked what you did ,
and they obviously already caught you ,
so what &apos;s the harm ?
well , if there &apos;s no harm ,
then why don &apos;t you tell me what you &apos;re in for ?
that could take a while .
i don &apos;t know about you ,
but i &apos;m free for the next two years .
careful .
see , now you &apos;ve told me how long you &apos;re in for .
starts there , ends with you telling me
you were born a poor black child .
you know &quot; the jerk &quot; ?
yeah , you know &quot; the jerk &quot; ?
yeah , i watched a lot of movies growing up .
we watch a lot of movies in here .
all right , you want to know my story ?
it starts long before i did what i did ,
because i wasn &apos;t born a poor black child ,
but i was born poor ,
which made me susceptible to wanting to be rich .
of course i &apos;m thinking about myself .
what , you wouldn &apos;t ?
please , you &apos;d throw a giraffe off of noah &apos;s ark
just to save your sorry ass .
the world &apos;s probably without unicorns
because of one of your ancestors , and i--
will you just let me finish a thought , for god &apos;s sake ?
louis ? what exactly are you doing ?
well , what does it look like i &apos;m doing ?
i &apos;m having a discussion about the fate of the firm
with my dead secretary &apos;s ashes .
well , as long as it &apos;s not something weird .
what exactly have you two been doing the last half hour ?
the same thing you &apos;re about to do .
no way , i &apos;m not doing the mary jane .
yes , you are .
i &apos;m not huffing and puffing .
louis , it &apos;s the only way .
no , i &apos;m not doing the dirty .
it &apos;s okay . i got this .
i mean , if louis doesn &apos;t want to smoke it , maybe norma does .
don &apos;t you dare .
relax , louis .
it &apos;s not like it &apos;s gonna kill her .
harvey , that is not funny , okay ?
you &apos;re gonna get ashes in her ashes .
then why don &apos;t you just smoke it yourself ?
put that out .
nope .
i &apos;m gonna light this joint on the count of one ...
harvey , i &apos;m telling you .
two ...
harvey !
three .
did you pull your back out ?
give me the goddamn thing .
jesus christ .
that &apos;s the thing about computers .
you can delete whatever you want ,
but it &apos;s never really gone .
so , if you had just stopped one trade sooner ,
they might never have even caught you .
yeah , i could &apos;ve stopped five , four , three trades sooner .
they might not have . but how do you know ?
i &apos;ll tell you how you know .
you stop when you have enough money
to put your kids through college .
yeah , but what college ?
and what if they want to go to med school ?
and what if they need a car ?
and then somewhere along the way ,
you stop thinking about if they need a car ,
and you start thinking , &quot; i need a car . &quot;
and that &apos;s when you get caught ,
because whether you want to admit it to yourself or not ,
you were never thinking about them in first place .
and whether you were or weren &apos;t ,
once you start , you don &apos;t stop .
that &apos;s one hell of a story , frank .
yeah , well , this is prison .
everyone &apos;s got a hell of a story .
anyway , that &apos;s enough for one night .
i &apos;m gonna go to bed .
my story started with my grandmother .
she was sick ,
and she needed money ...
and i found a way to get it for her .
holy shit .
this is the best thing ever .
i love the both of you so much .
this is your doing .
harvey , we &apos;re making progress .
holy shit . this is the best egg roll ever .
jesus christ , get me out of here .
this is so awesome .
i mean , i haven &apos;t been this stress @-@ free
since i took gold in the math @-@ lympics
and esther went to fat camp in the same week .
esther went to fat camp ?
they called it violin all @-@ stars ,
but we all know what that &apos;s code for .
and if you so much as picture her in a school @-@ girl outfit .
come on , louis , we &apos;re all feeling good .
you telling me you never slipped up
and had an inappropriate relationship ?
louis , i do not want to know the answer to that .
i did .
it was the most shameful night of my life .
harvey , don &apos;t--
what exactly was so shameful about it ?
well , she was a paralegal ,
and i took mud with her .
i don &apos;t understand .
are you saying you sullied her reputation ?
no , i &apos;m saying i sullied the concept of mud .
what the hell are you talking about ?
what , do i need a bullhorn ?
i had a premature muddification .
what the hell does that mean ?
i think we all know what that means .
it means i couldn &apos;t hold my mud .
i still don &apos;t know what that means .
did you take a shit in the mud ?
no , that &apos;s disgusting .
well , what part of this conversation isn &apos;t disgusting ?
i know i &apos;m gonna regret asking this .
who exactly was it ?
i cannot tell you that information .
okay , good , because the truth is , i don &apos;t--
it was missy dietler .
louis , i &apos;m gonna ask you a question .
i want you to tell me the truth .
does missy dietler know you couldn &apos;t hold your mud ?
oh , heavens no .
the turkish silt was thick enough
to prevent her from feeling it , so ...
was it thick enough to hide you wanting to go sleep after ?
my god , she knew .
i got news for you , louis . they always know .
oh , you &apos;re so right .
you &apos;re so right .
she--
i need 15 minutes to myself .
and that &apos;s it .
i cut a deal , and now i &apos;m here .
wait a second .
if you &apos;re a fake lawyer , they had to give you a chance
to turn on someone to get out of it .
they did .
so why the hell didn &apos;t you do it ?
because i wouldn &apos;t have been able to live with myself .
somebody out there owes you a lot .
yeah , well ...
i owe him a lot too .
so , what , you &apos;re--
you &apos;re like a @-@ a good guy or something ?
am i ?
what do you mean ?
i left the woman i love at the altar today .
why &apos;d you do that ?
because i didn &apos;t want to chain her to me
if there was even the chance that she would regret it .
then , yeah , you &apos;re a good guy .
thanks , frank .
one thing about everyone being gone ...
we got the run of the place .
i never knew what the ceiling looked like in here .
it &apos;s like &quot; the breakfast club . &quot;
do you ever not quote a movie ?
no , and you got a problem with that , frankly , my dear ,
i don &apos;t give a damn .
you &apos;re an idiot .
you think louis is gonna be okay with me now ?
i think we &apos;re about to find out .
harvey , what i was saying before ...
you don &apos;t need to say anything , louis .
i &apos;m not gonna tell anyone .
that &apos;s not what i was gonna say .
it &apos;s not the only inappropriate relationship i ever had .
i recorded you saying that you knew about mike ,
and i almost gave it to anita gibbs .
did you know about this ?
no .
but i suspected when he tried to get me
to turn you in to gibbs with him .
and what exactly was your response to that request ?
she said we didn &apos;t need to do that ,
and if it came to it ,
you would take the bullet for both of us .
i would have .
i &apos;m sorry , harvey .
i almost ruined your life .
you don &apos;t need to be sorry , louis .
the truth is , i &apos;m the one that ruined all of our lives ,
when i hired mike .
and i never apologized to either one of you for it ,
but i will now .
i &apos;m sorry .
so ...
we good ?
we &apos;re good .
all right , now that the two of you have made peace ,
let &apos;s figure out how we &apos;re gonna win this war ,
which starts with knowing how much we have in our war chest .
what exactly does that mean ?
it means it &apos;s time
to answer the question that she asked two hours ago .
how much money do we have ?
this again ?
louis , after everything we &apos;ve been through tonight ,
how hard could it be for us to write down
how much we &apos;re worth right now ?
i need another 15 minutes to myself .
again ?
aw , harvey , let him go .
he probably doesn &apos;t have as much as we do ,
and it &apos;s a vulnerable thing for him .
&quot; vulnerable &quot; ?
he just told us he jerked off in the mud an hour ago .
you don &apos;t think he &apos;s gonna do that right now , do you ?
based on what he told us ,
he doesn &apos;t need 15 minutes for that .
you want to call her ?
what ?
your fiancée , you want to call her ?
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about my first night in here .
i remember thinking what i wouldn &apos;t give
to let jennifer know i was okay .
the thing is , i couldn &apos;t , but you can .
i thought we weren &apos;t allowed to have phones in here .
yeah , well , i wasn &apos;t allowed to make inside trades either .
but i did , and now i &apos;m in here .
what else are they gonna do ?
uh , thanks , but ...
i just ...
i just can &apos;t right now .
whenever you want , phone &apos;s right here .
let &apos;s try to get some shut @-@ eye , man .
you okay ?
he &apos;s everywhere .
he &apos;s all around here , donna .
the first place we met was down the hallway .
and the first time we kissed was in the library .
and i met his grandmother 50 feet from here .
and right here , he told me the truth .
rachel--
he was standing
right where you are , and i was upset with him
about something that i don &apos;t even remember .
and then he told me that he had lost everyone in his life ,
and then he told me he was a fraud .
and then we ... mm .
you &apos;re gonna get through this .
i know .
i just wish i could see him .
what do you mean ? you can see him .
no , i can &apos;t . i called the prison .
you called the prison tonight ?
yes , because i wanted to know if he was okay .
and they ...
they wouldn &apos;t give me any information .
so then i asked them about visitation ,
and they said that i had to wait ,
and i had to get on a list , and--
how long ?
at least a month .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
you always know what to say .
not this time .
excuse me , ladies .
sorry to interrupt , but i think we might have a problem .
what is it , benjamin ?
we &apos;re being hacked .
oh , that &apos;s a tidy little sum you got there .
you &apos;re not doing so bad yourself .
no , i am not .
not bad for two people that came from nothing .
i didn &apos;t come from nothing , and you know it .
bet it still feels pretty good to write that number down .
oh , it sure does .
you &apos;re still a little high , aren &apos;t you ?
i sure am .
there . you wanted you wanted to know my net worth .
you got it .
holy shit .
who are you ?
are you a king ?
no , i &apos;m just not an idiot .
what the hell have you been doing with your money ?
louis , we &apos;re not exactly poor .
that &apos;s what bolivia says to the u.s. ,
but if nato goes to war , they &apos;re not kicking in dick .
well , if you &apos;re so damn rich , why didn &apos;t you pony up
for donna &apos;s salary when you had the chance ?
do you even know how to spell &quot; fiscal responsibility &quot; ?
i know how to spell &quot; cheap . &quot;
all right , that &apos;s enough .
at least now we know
we have enough to fund ourselves for a while .
you guys have two rich uncles ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m not carrying your asses if this thing drags out .
louis , this is a team effort , and i swear to god ,
if you don &apos;t come through on this--
i hate to interrupt your &quot; breakfast club &quot; moment ,
but you need to sober up .
donna , what is it ?
according to benjamin ,
the partners didn &apos;t just leave .
they &apos;re coming after every client we have .
all right , give me an update
and give it to me in plain english .
i was able to shut the hack down ,
but not before they got all three of your clients &apos; files .
shit , they &apos;re trying to put us in the ground tonight .
then we have to stop it before it even gets started .
well , the only problem with that
is that we don &apos;t know what bullshit story
they &apos;re out there selling right now .
then we need to figure it out . we need to figure it out fast .
it &apos;s the main line .
what should we do ?
donna .
pearson specter litt , may i help you ?
one moment , please .
it &apos;s for you . it &apos;s jim reynolds .
that &apos;s decker pharmaceutical . don &apos;t take it . he &apos;s leaving us .
louis , he &apos;s my oldest client .
i &apos;m not ducking his call .
jessica .
put him on speaker .
jim , how can i help you ?
you can tell me what &apos;s going on there .
i &apos;ve been hearing a lot of rumors ,
and i need to hear the truth from you .
all right , jim , you want to hear the truth ?
we went out for the afternoon , and when we got back ,
every partner in the place was gone .
but i &apos;m telling you ,
the name partners are still here ,
and we can still service you and the board .
i know you can .
then you &apos;re not calling to say that you &apos;re leaving us ?
i was calling to tell you i &apos;ve been sent notice .
they &apos;re bifurcating your firm ,
and the other partners have nothing to do
with pearson specter litt anymore .
thanks , jim . i appreciate it , and i won &apos;t forget it .
jessica , if you &apos;re not back on your feet
by the end of the month ,
i won &apos;t be able to hold off the board .
if we &apos;re not back by the end of the month ,
i will call the board and resign from service myself .
isn &apos;t this good ? they &apos;re not trying to poach .
it &apos;s just as bad .
what do you mean ?
it means they don &apos;t care about clients right now .
they &apos;re bifurcating the firm
because they want their buy @-@ ins back .
and they hacked us to get our clients &apos; information
so that they could deliver notice .
we need to move the money that we have
in every account by tomorrow .
we don &apos;t need to move it . we need to use it .
if you &apos;re thinking what i think you &apos;re thinking ,
you &apos;re a genius .
what are you talking about ?
we can use their buy @-@ ins
to settle the class @-@ action lawsuits .
and they won &apos;t be able to sue us for the money back
because it &apos;ll already be gone .
you really are a genius .
thanks , harvey .
uh , might i point out that i was the one
that brought the hacking to your attention
in the first place , so ...
you might as well tell me what &apos;s on your mind .
i can hear you staring at the wall
from all the way over here .
how do you handle it ...
being away from jennifer for so long ?
trust each other , visit each other ,
and don &apos;t ask questions you don &apos;t want answers to .
that doesn &apos;t sound like fun .
yeah , well , it shouldn &apos;t be that hard for you .
you &apos;re only here for two years .
i &apos;m here for five more .
jesus .
you &apos;re telling me .
you know , maybe i &apos;ll just send rachel a text ...
you know , let her know that i &apos;m okay .
sure thing , kid .
just give it back when you &apos;re done .
well , now that we &apos;re starting fresh ,
can we please finally get rid of that hideous duck painting ?
no , louis , we can &apos;t .
why not ?
because it &apos;s like you .
i can &apos;t stand it , but it &apos;s part of the family .
speaking of family , where &apos;s gretchen ?
i can &apos;t believe she would walk out on us too .
she didn &apos;t . we were supposed to be at the wedding ,
so i gave her the day off to go to the orthodontist .
orthodontist ?
yeah , the woman &apos;s in her 60s .
she still wears a retainer .
all right , we have a game plan .
tomorrow morning , we offer them
ten cents on the dollar to settle these suits .
and from this point on ,
we are all committing to giving this firm
every ounce of blood , sweat , and tears we have .
what is it ?
i just got a text from mike .
what does it say ?
it says that he &apos;s settling in
and that he &apos;s getting along well with his roommate ...
and that he thinks he &apos;s gonna be okay .
maybe he &apos;s gonna be okay ,
but his roommate &apos;s in for trouble .
to trouble .
to trouble .
what ?
she texted you back .
what did she say ?
she says she got your text , she misses you ,
and she &apos;s glad you get along with your roomate .
thanks , frank .
for everthing .
all right , let &apos;s go .
come on , you got to get out before next shift .
they can &apos;t know i let you switch .
wait , switch what ?
i &apos;m in the right cell . i &apos;m in the one you gave me .
yeah , but this isn &apos;t the one they gave me .
what ?
you &apos;re in the right cell . i &apos;m not .
what the hell are you talking about ?
only thing i told you tonight that &apos;s true
is that you shouldn &apos;t trust people in here .
but you did . now i know all about you .
why the hell would you do that to me ?
you said you could &apos;ve turned on a guy to get out of here
but you didn &apos;t because you owe him .
well , i owe that son of bitch too .
harvey .
yeah , harvy specter .
put me away 13 years ago .
i &apos;ve been dreaming about getting him back ever since .
then i read about you in the paper .
i realized that
i could get back at him without leaving these walls .
you son of bitch .
get it easy , mike .
you remember i know about you .
and i get your little girlfriend &apos;s number right here .
