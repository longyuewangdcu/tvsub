We should get on the road.
What's the hurry?
I'm going to go gas up the car.
You meet me down there as soon as you can.
Zachary!
Who is that?
Get in the car!
My mom. I'm sorry.
Right now! Now!
Well, now you know.
Know what?
How weird my mom is.
OK, yeah, she's a little kooky.
But so what.
I know that you were at school
the night of my photo shoot, making fake IDs.
I guess one of the fakes got confiscated last night at a bar.
Don't worry, I'll get you your money back.
What if I moved in?
Maybe when he moves back to his mom's,
we can revisit the idea.
So what did you do with the money?
I mean, since you didn't give it to Callie.
They really want me to testify,
and I... I'm scared they're going to cut off my food stamps.
Maybe I can help you.
You're telling people our IDs don't work?
I changed my mind.
Well, now I'm going to return the favor.
That was amazing.
Yeah. Except, I can't keep the triplets
in time with the eighth notes, and I keep missing the sharps.
Well, yeah, there's that, but, um, otherwise...
I have an audition for the San Diego Junior Symphony.
How did that happen?
My dad's girlfriend knows somebody.
Wow. Symphony?
Junior.
But still, that's a big deal.
Yeah. If I can get the ascending arpeggio right.
But, it's nice to see you...
so passionate about your music again.
Remember, you brought me up here my first day at Anchor Beach?
Yeah.
I never thought I'd still be here.
I... I asked you how you felt
when your moms adopted Jesus and Mariana.
Yeah, I, um...
I said this was me and my moms...
...and then the twins came...
...and then Jude...
...and then... you.
Is that how you feel?
No.
No. This is... This is you.
So we got the court date.
We're getting adopted on Monday.
Monday.
Yeah.
I should, um, let you get that arpeggio ascending.
Right. Yeah.
Do you still hate me?
Well, hate's a strong word.
How are you?
I'm good.
You look good.
How would you know?
Wait. What exactly is a "Hoosier"?
I don't know, and nobody really does.
But everyone in Indiana is damn proud to be one.
Hey, so, there's something I've been wondering...
The next morning, at the motel,
where you kind of freaked out...
Was that because...
I mean, were you really going for gas,
or were you trying to get away,
before Lena and Stef got there?
I was trying to get away before they got there.
With you.
But you called them.
I changed my mind.
Why?
You know why.
So you forgive me?
No, there's nothing to forgive.
You did the right thing.
What?
I think you have more hair than me now.
Jealous?
A little.
We are looking for the X intercept
where Y is zero.
How's wrestling without me?
Same as it was with you.
So, if Y equals zero...
So, you don't miss me at all?
I miss not being the worst one on the team.
Come on, write it down.
Look, I really want to help you do this thing, without your meds.
But if you're not going to try to concentrate...
OK, OK. I promise I'll concentrate.
If you'll go to the Winter Ball with me.
I have a date.
Who?
None of your business.
What's his name?
Jesus.
Would you like to stay after school?
Would you?
How about a little more algebra, a little less attitude.
Yes, sir.
Mariana!
Guess who I'm here to see?
Who?
Your mother.
My mother?
About the dance.
Oh my... Did I scare you?
Yeah, a little.
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to do that.
Mom?
Oh, shoot.
It's supposed to be a surprise.
What?
I'm volunteering to be a chaperone at Metropolis:
The Winter Ball!
But don't worry, I'm all for dirty dancing.
Oh! I got to dash.
Don't want to keep someone's future mother-in-law waiting.
Mom...
OK.
Well, at least she likes me today.
Why does everything have to be a surprise?
Yeah, you'd think her mood swings were enough.
Sorry.
But, you know, maybe she needs to see a doctor.
No, she doesn't. She's... eccentric.
She called me a whore.
Maybe she had a little too much wine.
She doesn't even remember.
Hey, she obviously loves you.
So, speaking of the ball,
have you thought about...
Are you going?
Not sure. Are you going?
I sort of have to since my mom's in charge of the whole thing.
Oh, right.
Uh... Well, I better get to class.
Hey. Still on nights?
Yep.
Do you know for how much longer?
'Cause I really don't like that Brandon's alone at night.
He's sixteen.
Yeah, exactly.
And he's not always alone.
Dani's over a lot.
She makes him dinner practically every night.
How's he doing?
He's doing great.
He's practicing hard for his audition.
He's really back on track.
Well, good. Means he can come home soon.
Yeah, I'll tell Dani you say thank you.
Stefanie Foster?
Yeah?
I'm Ana Gutierrez...
I know who you are.
Well, we need to talk.
About what?
About your son.
He gave me money.
To change my story.
To say I wasn't there the night that your partner killed Evan.
You're out of your mind.
Ask him.
I don't need to.
I'll tell the DA.
Unless...
I want $10,000.
And then you'll never see me again.
If I do see you again,
I will arrest you for trying to extort a police officer.
Woo! Looking good there, my friend. Thank you.
I got to stay in shape
for when I get back on the wrestling team.
Oh, yeah? Well, I'll tell you what, you should try studying
because that's not going to happen until you get your grades up.
Exercise helps me concentrate.
Mm-hmm. Let me ask you this.
Have you considered going back on your meds?
No.
Well, uh, Lena mentioned that some of your teachers are concerned
because you've been a little on edge lately.
They just don't want to deal.
You said you'd give me a chance to do this.
It hasn't been that long.
OK, we'll give you some more time.
But I want to see a change in your grades and your attitude.
Yeah, OK.
Ok.
You got some guns there, Mom.
Yeah, I know, I know. I work out. I got to, right?
Listen, you haven't, uh,
you haven't seen... Ana, have you?
Ana? No.
Not since... at the hospital.
OK. OK.
Why?
No. Just, uh, just checking in.
But if she ever does try to contact you
or your sister, you will let me know right away. Yes?
Yeah. OK.
OK.
So how many pull-ups can you do?
More than you.
Oh, please.
You little whippersnapper. Get out of the way here.
You just want to see an old lady sweat.
Put your money where your mouth is.
I'm going to bed.
You can get... Aw!
I love you.
Doesn't he realize that only like losers go to dances alone?
I'm going alone.
Well, you could ask Wyatt. It's all over school he's back.
Well, he's not back yet. And he wouldn't want to go.
Well, I can't believe they're announcing nominations
for Winter King and Queen tomorrow
and I don't even have a date.
Maybe Zac's waiting for you to ask him.
Why?
The panty incident?
Oh, my God. Can everyone please stop talking about that?
I'm just saying, he might be gun shy.
His mother was all right with it?
Yeah, I guess he wasn't happy in Indiana
and a friend's family said he could come and live with them.
And, uh, how do we feel about
Wyatt being back in Callie's life?
He did call us to come get her.
That was the right thing to do.
Yeah, but letting her run away with him was not.
I think he's a good kid.
Maybe it's a good thing...
...for both Callie and Brandon.
You think Callie's going to start dating him again?
It wouldn't be the worst thing.
Honey, that's...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hey, do you think for one night
we could sleep on a level playing field?
I'd love to see your beautiful face and not the mattress.
I've just got all these baby books to read, honey.
It's not that complicated. They eat, they cry, they poop.
That's pretty much all you need to know.
I know we can't afford a new mattress,
but what if we can sell this one, huh?
We could do that.
No, I think it's illegal to sell a used mattress?
No, it's illegal to cut tags off pillows.
Why is that?
I don't know.
Look, I hate this crack between the two of us.
We barely cuddle anymore. Hello, over there.
I think we should keep it.
You know, it'll be great when I'm pregnant.
Adjust the position, be more comfortable.
Yeah, you're right.
Someday we'll be intimate again.
It's fine, it's fine.
Honey, we were intimate last week, when we inseminated.
Nothing intimate about that.
I'm sorry. I didn't...
You barely touched your dinner.
Uh... Sorry. I... wasn't hungry.
You want to talk about it?
Callie and Jude are getting adopted on monday.
Like, officially.
Is that what's bothering you?
No. I mean, I want her to get adopted.
It's just,
the guy she ran away with,
he's back, I guess.
What's the story with him?
They dated, um, when she started at Anchor Beach.
Nothing serious.
Well, if she starts seeing him again,
you only have yourself to blame.
You moved in with your dad to give yourself some space,
to get over Callie.
But all you're really doing
is giving her the space to get over you.
If she hasn't already.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I mean, I just...
Tell her.
Tell her that you're not going to get over each other.
Look. Why don't I get your dad
to take me to a movie tomorrow night
before he goes into work.
You guys can have the place to yourself for a couple of hours.
To talk, or, you know... whatever.
You have to convince her it's not too late.
莉娜说只需填写你所在的家庭的联系信息就可以返校咯
Hey! Hey, no, wait!
I'm here! I'm here!
So, I was going to wait for you to ask me,
but then Callie made me realize...
Whoa, stop.
Follow me.
Open it.
What is this?
Mystery Date. You know, the board game.
Is it new?
No. It's like, old. It's really old.
It was my mom's favorite game from when she was a girl.
I told her you wouldn't get it.
Well, what's the mystery?
Well, see, you don't know who's behind the door.
It could be your dream date
or, you know, a bum.
So, which are you?
Hopefully not a bum.
My mom thought that it would be a "Charming" Way
of asking you to be my date to the Winter Ball.
It is charming.
And yes!
You OK?
Yeah, he's just...
Holding a grudge?
I guess. I don't know.
He promised some great revenge,
but so far, it's been keying my car and bumping into me.
Well, let's hope that's as far as it goes.
Uh, so, I was, uh, wondering if...
Can you come over after school? To my dad's?
Why? What's up?
Well, no, there's just something I need you to hear.
Oh, for your audition?
I could meet you in the music room at lunch?
Actually, it kind of needs to be at my dad's.
OK. Well, I have group,
so I could stop by after, like around 4:30.
OK. Yeah. See you then.
Good morning, Anchor Beach.
The votes are in and it's time to announce
your nominees for Winter King and Queen.
Starting with ladies first: Paige Blyers...
Oh my God! You are so going to win!
... Talya Banks, and...
... Callie Jacob.
Callie Jacob? Is that a joke?
I think you'd make a great queen.
I'm taking my name off the ballot.
It's only a joke if you let it get to you.
You should act like, hell yeah, I got nominated,
and then, the joke's on them.
Well, that is a very enlightened way of looking at it.
I'm a very enlightened guy.
I guess I'm not.
Hey, um, how about a ride to group, Guru Wy?
Unfortunately, I'm not so enlightened
when it comes to reading parking signs.
My car got towed this morning
and I don't have $150 to get it out.
What about your friend's parents?
Can't they help you out?
He actually didn't ask his parents
if I could live with them until I got here.
He thought they'd feel obligated
if I just showed up on their doorstep.
Turns out, they didn't.
So, where have you been living?
*Because I'm just an outlaw*
演唱者 David Lambert
*Wanted, if you want me*
*I love you every day and every night*
*Love, love, love is my cry*
*So, baby, come catch me*
*and let's do the time*
抱歉 来不了 以后解释
He's been living in his car. He's got no place to stay.
I ain't allowed no roommates.
It's just for a few nights. Please?
All right.
It's cool.
So, how do you know her?
Well, mostly from the group home I was in.
After juvie.
She's good people.
Hey, um, I've got to get home. I'll call you later, OK?
We'll figure something out. Don't worry.
You hungry?
Uh, yeah. Thanks.
It's hot.
Thanks.
So, Callie says you guys met at a group home?
Met again.
You met before that?
In juvie.
I beat her up.
I'm not going to the stupid Winter Ball.
Sorry, Lena.
And I'm taking my name off the ballot.
We can do that.
I still think you should go, though.
Why?
What?
Principal Sanchez did not give a very positive progress report
to your parole officer.
What did she say?
That you are not making friends,
and not participating in school activities.
Well, she should write
that the kids at school are making fun of me.
You don't know that for sure.
I wish people were making fun of me.
Mariana...
If that meant
I was getting nominated for Winter Queen.
At least people know who you are.
Have you ever seen that movie Carrie?
Jesus. Really?
Where's Jude, by the way?
He's having dinner at Connor's tonight.
What if you didn't take your name off the ballot?
Wouldn't that look good to your P.O.,
if the kids at school were nominating you?
As a joke.
He wouldn't know that.
And if it is a joke,
you'd have the last laugh, wouldn't you?
That's what Wyatt said.
I think he's right.
You know, when I was in school the kids used to call me "Oreo."
Because I'm bi-racial.
That's lame.
Not as lame as when they found out I was a lesbian.
是对肤色和性向的讽刺
Then they called me a "Klon-Dyke Bar."
That's not funny.
It's not funny. It's mean. It's very mean.
So, what did you do about it?
Well, I brought a hundred Klondike Bars to school one day,
I passed them out to all the kids,
and they never called me that again.
That's kind of awesome.
Sometimes, the best way to fight back is to rise above.
演唱者 Starshook
How's business?
It's pretty good. There's a run on punch.
Can I get some of that?
Thank you for getting me this gig.
Now I'll be able to get my car back.
Thank Lena.
Hey, how's it going at Daphne's?
She hasn't tried to beat me up. Yet.
People change.
That's true.
Look at you, you're at the Winter Ball,
nominated for Winter Queen.
You even kept your name on the ballot.
Yeah. I'm "rising above."
And I'm pouring punch.
Maybe you'll dance with me later?
Maybe.
After they get a ballot, they get a stamp on their wrist,
so that they can't vote again.
OK, I got it. No ballot stuffing.
This isn't Florida. I'm all over it.
Great, thank you.
You really knocked yourself out this year.
Yeah. The kids seem to be having a great time, right?
I wish Callie was.
She's here. That's what counts.
Oh. And nominated for Winter Queen.
Yeah, the kids must be really taking a liking to her.
Oh, my son is here. Excuse me.
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.
You really know how to throw a party.
Thank you.
Uh, Brandon, will you do me a favor?
Could you ask Callie to dance?
Brothers can ask sisters to dance, right?
I just... I don't really feel like dancing right now.
Brandon, please?
And if you could dance near Principal Sanchez,
that would be great.
I'll be right back.
Kyle Dumbass, really?
I'm just saying, you could do better.
God knows I've done worse.
I thought you bailed.
You want to dance?
It's OK. Lena asked me to ask you.
Something about looking like you're having fun?
Right.
Yeah, thanks.
Hey, I just voted for you!
Thanks!
Hey, let me in.
What's up?
This the place?
Close the door.
Awesome.
Well, to Callie Jacob.
Yeah, Callie Jacob.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Ok.
Oh, man.
That's awesome.
演唱者 Starshook
May I?
Oh, um, sure.
I know what's going on.
What?
I'm not a fool.
I know you're screwing her.
What I don't understand is how you can flaunt it
in front of all our friends.
Mom...
I won't be humiliated, Zachary. I won't.
What happened?
I'm sorry.
Just this whole Winter Queen thing
is making me feel really uncomfortable.
Honestly, I am so tired of being judged.
I'm tired, too.
Of what?
Of being here whenever you need my shoulder to cry on.
What about when I need you?
What about when I needed to talk to you the other day
and you just blew me off?
I didn't, I... I was with Wyatt.
Oh good, that makes me feel so much better.
He was living in his car, so I took him to Daphne's.
Then why don't you get a place together or something?
I mean, that was the plan, right?
If you'd made it to Indiana.
Where's this coming from?
I'm still in love with you.
Don't.
We can't...
Yes, we can.
You can still get adopted.
And... I'll stay at my dad's.
We can see each other there.
Behind everybody's backs?
Then we'll wait till we're 18...
Brandon, I'm going to be your sister.
We're not related.
We don't share the same blood.
There's nothing wrong or illegal about that.
So...
If you're not really my brother,
then Stef and Lena won't really be my mothers.
No, it's not the same.
It's exactly the same.
I need a family.
Not a piece of paper.
If that's what adoption is, then what's the point?
Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
We can't keep doing this.
But we do. We keep doing this.
Because what we feel, happens once in a lifetime.
You have to let me go.
We have to fight for it.
Please.
Then, help me.
Tell me you don't love me anymore.
Tell me something to make me get over you.
I had sex with Wyatt.
When we ran away, we stayed in the same motel room.
Slept in the same bed.
In the middle of the night, I curled up next to him.
We were half asleep... it just happened.
If I can have everyone's attention, please.
Can all the nominees for Winter King and Queen
please come up on stage?
Her car's still here.
That's a good thing, I guess.
Go back in the party. I'll find her.
Not alone you won't.
Your votes have been counted
and your Winter King and Queen are...
...Vico Cerar!
And your Queen is...
...Callie Jacob.
Cal-lie, Cal-lie, Cal-lie!
So, how does it feel to be Winter King and Queen?
Uh... Awesome!
Callie? Do you have anything to say?
This is such an honor.
I want to thank everyone who voted for me
and just say from the bottom of my heart,
how thrilled I am to be your Winter Queen.
Cal-lie! Cal-lie! Cal-lie!
演唱者 Starshook
What's going on in here?
She... just... She doesn't feel well.
Get out here, right now.
Where did this alcohol come from?
Callie Jacob bought it, so we'd vote for her.
I didn't even want to be Winter Queen.
You could have fooled me.
No, I was just...
She wanted to take her name off the ballot.
Then why didn't she?
We encouraged her not to.
We thought it might look good to her parole officer.
Oh, and winning would look even better.
How would she even buy alcohol? She's 16 years old.
She could have a fake ID.
I don't have a fake ID.
You can search my purse. I'll go get it right now.
Karina. What's going on?
I'm being set up.
By whom?
I don't know.
Slow your roll there.
What do you want?
How about your car keys.
Jesus...
He's drunk.
Look, dude, just mind your own business.
Let him go!
I just want his keys!
Get off him! He's not driving! OK?
I am!
I was just...
Being a jerk! Just stay away from me!
Mom?
Hello.
Are you OK?
I'm fine.
Let's go home.
Home? I'm...
I'm sorry... Do I know you?
It's me.
Zac.
Your... your son.
That's not mine.
It's got your picture and your name on it.
Let me see.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to have to call the police.
I'm going to keep this. Like wear it every day.
Hey, you think you can get to me by hurting Callie?
You seem pretty upset about it.
She could get sent back to juvie!
Which would break your heart, wouldn't it?
All I have to do is tell them
you set her up because I bought back the IDs.
What IDs? The kids we sold to aren't going to talk,
so it's your word against mine.
She didn't do anything to you.
Well, she did ask me to make her a fake ID. Which I did.
And when they check her phone,
they'll see she texted a few kids to spread the word
about the complimentary booze in the bathroom...
Get your hands off me!
What the hell is going on here?
Get out of my face!
If you know what's going down with Callie,
you need to do something, now.
卫生间有我请大家喝的免费酒 传播下这个消息
Can you think of any reason
someone would go through all this trouble
to make this fake ID and plant it in your purse?
Callie, you need to tell the truth.
We don't know that she's not.
I'd like to see those texts, please.
Brandon, not now.
I know who did this.
Oh, yeah? Who?
It was me.
Be very careful what you say right now, Brandon.
I set Callie up.
I planted the fake ID in her purse.
I sent texts from her phone. I bought the alcohol.
Everything.
Brandon...
He's obviously trying to protect her.
No. I'm not.
I wanted to hurt her because she hurt me.
She led me on and made me believe she cared about me.
And she lied.
So, I wanted to send her back to juvie
so we wouldn't adopt her.
How did you buy the alcohol?
With this.
I took your key and made the IDs on the machine at school.
Why come forward now?
Because I realized tonight that I was wrong.
She didn't lead me on...
Don't do this.
Let me talk, Callie.
I realized tonight that you didn't lead me on.
You just never felt the way I did. Not really.
It was all in my head.
And I should've accepted what you kept telling me.
What you needed. What you wanted.
It was never me.
What do you want me to do?
Arrest him.
Every student will be subjected to a sobriety test...
Wait. What's going on? Brandon?!
Are you OK?
Brandon!
Callie, stay back.
It wasn't true.
What I said about Wyatt, it was not true.
Where is he?
He's still in the car.
I talked to the guys who brought Brandon in.
They don't want to do the paperwork on this.
You better start talking,
and I don't want one more lie to come out of your mouth.
I did take the key...
...and I did make fake IDs with Vico.
But then, I realized it was a mistake,
so I bought them all back.
And, um... And then he got pissed.
And he set up Callie to get back at me.
Why would you make fake IDs?
To sell them.
Yes, I realize that.
Why?
I needed the money to pay you back
for all the piano lessons I didn't go to.
You paid me back.
Dani gave me that money.
To give to you.
What happened to your father's money?
I gave it to Ana.
You gave the money to Ana?
Why?
To change her story.
So you wouldn't go on trial.
