Am I too old to get pregnant?
Would you like me to start you on pre-natal vitamins?
Yes.
If Callie decides that she does not want to be adopted,
do you want to be adopted without her?
I am getting adopted, with or without you.
Well, I think you need to have a conversation with Callie.
She's trying to get her own apartment.
You think she's doing this so she can be with Brandon?
You locked me in a room with some man
who proceeded to tell me that being gay was a sin.
Well, I was being a parent, I was pushing you in the right direction.
Hey, Dad? Dad?
Dad?
演唱者 Dave Thomas Junior
There you go, Dad. That should fix you right up.
How's the game?
We're getting killed.
Do you remember when we went to see the Padres in Chicago that time?
You were, I don't know, maybe six or seven...
How can I forget. That was my first away game, right?
It was the first time you ever saw snow.
Oh my gosh, that's right. Oh, man.
You said, "Daddy, why is the sky so dusty."
Your mom and I, oh, we laughed so hard
and you got angry, you said,
"What? What's so funny? What's so funny?"
Yeah, well, how was I supposed to know?
You and Mom were laughing at me.
It was a little rude, I think.
That was a great trip.
I miss that.
When things weren't so... damn complicated.
Me, too, Dad. Me, too.
第一季第十五集
Oh. Sorry.
It's OK. Come in. I'm done.
It's just...
It's my first funeral.
It's not as bad as you think.
What was your mom's like?
Weird.
Sad.
Everyone just kept telling us,
"She's in a better place now."
I don't know.
Do you believe in heaven?
I... I don't know.
Do you?
I believe there are people up there,
looking out for us.
At least I hope so.
I know that today's not gonna be easy for you, so anything you want.
I'm fine. I'm fine, really.
I know. But I know that you're upset
that you didn't get to talk to your dad.
You know, it is what it is.
That's life, I guess. But I don't have any regrets.
We have to put out the bourbon too for the old fashions.
You sure we have enough bitters?
Yes, positive.
And if we need more "bitter,"
we can just ask my mom to tell stories
about all those times she was passed over for tenure.
I'm going to make sure the kids are ready.
Oh, listen, speaking of the kids,
um, what do you wanna do about,
you know, the whole Callie of it all?
We really don't think that this Independent Living thing
has anything to do with Brandon, do we?
No, he says it's over between the two of them.
In any case, Callie's not allowed to date while she's in Girls United, so...
So we just keep an eye on them. We can do that.
It's not like we have anything else going on today.
No.
I'm gonna go rally the troops.
OK.
OK.
Honey, have you seen my mascara?
You don't have to go if you don't want to.
I don't want Jude to have to face it alone.
You're a good sister.
Thanks for the ride.
OK, it's gonna be OK.
Stewart sends his love. He's so sorry he can't be here.
No apologies necessary. I'm just glad you're here. Thank you.
Hi, Lena. I'm so sorry.
Thank you, and thank you so much for coming.
Yeah. Is Mike here?
I haven't seen him yet, why?
Has Stef seen the paper today?
No.
All right, good. Don't let her.
Hi, sweetheart. Thank you so much for coming.
It means a lot to us.
You know you're always gonna be a member of this family,
no matter what.
Hi, love. I'm glad you're here.
This is gonna be a little harder than I thought.
All right, let's get this over with.
You OK, buddy?
Yeah, are you?
Yeah. Come on.
Thank you for being here
to celebrate the life of Colleen Jacob
who was taken from us far too soon.
All right, everybody! We need all hands on deck.
We need people to pass out the pigs in blankets.
And don't forget to put on your Padres colors please.
Um, Mom?
Yeah, honey.
Would it be OK if Connor came over today? Would that be weird?
No, I think that's a great idea.
Why don't you go give him a call?
He called me Mom.
Hey, Callie. Can we get you anything?
Some water or...?
No, thank you.
OK, well, if you need anything, we're right here.
It's too bad my grampa wasn't there.
But I, for one, will never forget that day.
Duh. It's your mom's wedding.
Well, yeah, but it's also the first time we kissed.
We should go help set up.
I can't believe I'm wearing a Padres hat.
That's how much I liked Frank.
Well, he and Stef and Brandon are very grateful, I'm sure.
How is she doing?
She's OK. She's actually a lot better than I expected.
How are you?
What do you mean?
I talked to Captain Roberts.
She said there was some article in the newspaper today.
Not now.
Mike.
It's nothing, really. It's about the shooting.
Just some worked up journalist,
trying to make a story out of nothing.
What?
Hey. What's up?
I just asked Lena if I could do anything to help.
Yes, you know what?
You can actually help me set up the poker table.
Thanks, you guys.
演唱者 Andrew Combs & Shannon Wright
OK, I will give you $100 if you eat a spoonful of that.
You don't even have $100.
OK, fine, ten dollars. But it has to be two spoonfuls.
Now wait, why does the amount go up
when the price goes down? No, that's ridiculous.
Eat it. Eat it.
No! No, you eat it!
No! No! No!
Eww, that's nasty!
Oh... my... God.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Here, let me do it. Let me do it.
I got it.
Perfect.
Aww. I miss you.
I really thought that we were gonna be sisters.
I miss you, too.
But it's not like we're never gonna see each other, right?
It's not like I'm all the way in Indiana or something.
Aren't you like scared of, you know, living on your own?
Not really.
Jude and I have been on our own a lot, you know?
Yeah, but you've always had each other.
Jude's pretty amazing.
I mean, being 12, going to his second funeral.
He's really strong.
Yeah, well he took our mom's death really hard.
He kinda freaked out.
Jude, what did you do?
I just hope he's OK today.
You know.
Hey, um, can I talk to you for a second?
Well, I thought the service was just beautiful.
And the eulogy the Pastor gave was perfect.
Oh, yeah, he sure does wax poetical, doesn't he?
You should have heard the eulogy he gave for my sexuality when I was 16.
What?
Yeah, that was the guy Dad sent me
to when he caught me cuddling on the couch with Tess.
He is?
Mm-hm.
Then why on earth did you ask him to do the eulogy?
Because he was Dad's minister
and that's what Dad would've wanted.
I'm surprised he came.
I never thought he would dare
enter the House of the Damned.
So I... I think maybe we should tell my moms that,
you know, we're together.
Wait, what? Why?
Well, I mean, we don't have a reason to hide anymore, right?
I mean, you're getting your own place,
you're not getting adopted.
So why can't we?
I don't feel like it's the right time right now, Brandon.
I mean, it's your grandfather's funeral.
Oh, of course, you're right. You're right.
Uh, maybe tomorrow?
Brandon, we need you downstairs, the CD's skipping.
Go.
Ok.
Um, I'll be right down, I just need a minute.
Ok.
OK, we're leaving. Don't stay up too late.
Are you mad?
Don't be like that. We won't be long.
Can I get a kiss goodbye?
Ok.
See you in the morning.
Isn't it a little... dark?
It was Dad's favorite.
Why couldn't his favorite have been cotton candy?
You can't be sad when there's cotton candy.
He used to tell everyone
that black licorice was the only candy he could have in the house
that I wouldn't steal.
Now I love it.
It's good. You should try some.
Right?
Not bad.
Not bad.
Thanks, hon.
Oh, my God. It's like evil in my mouth.
Hello?
Hi. I'm...
Emma, hi. Come in.
This is my sister, Mariana.
This is Emma.
Emma's on the wrestling team with me.
Oh, OK, so you're the crazy girl.
I only mean crazy 'cause you're wrestling with all those boys,
not 'cause you're actually crazy.
Mariana, walk away.
I know this is kinda...
I told my mom about your grampa
and she made me bring food.
We're Jews, it's what we do.
It's noodle kugel. It's totally delicious.
And it's organic so, you know, totally dye-free and everything.
You really didn't have to do this.
Try telling my mom that.
Do you want me to take your coat?
Ok.
Is there something you want to tell me about?
Mike told you?
Mike?
About the article? He said he didn't want to...
What article?
Lena?
Why didn't you tell me?
Stef, come on...
What did this article say?
It was about police brutality,
just the whole last section was about me, and the shooting.
Are you kidding me?
No. They make Ana's boyfriend out to be some sort of saint,
and me some overzealous cop with a vendetta.
They basically accuse me of murdering the guy.
I'm really sorry, Mike. I don't... Can I do anything?
No, look, all I know is I was supposed to be
going back to work next week
and now they're not gonna let me.
OK, I've got the refills of the pistachios and meatballs.
Hey, um, have you seen Jude?
Uh, he was out back a little bit ago but...
Ok.
Do you need any help?
Yeah, actually, you could take this to the buffet for me.
Yeah.
Hello, my love?
What's the matter?
Nothing. Nothing.
It's just, you know, Frank and...
I just never realized you two were that close.
No, we really weren't.
I mean, he had his lovable qualities but...
...more than that, it's Callie is here.
You know, she's being so sweet, so kind.
I just don't understand what she's thinking
with this whole getting-her-own-apartment thing.
It's completely baffling.
I know.
It's something else.
Lena Elizabeth, what's going on?
Sit.
OK, you can't say anything. Stef would kill me.
All right, but lately,
I have been thinking a lot
about the fact that... I never had a baby.
Really?
Yes.
And I did this insane thing at the ob-gyn
and had her test my levels and...
...everything's good, so technically, I could still...
Oh, honey.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You only feel this way
because you feel like your clock is running out.
Stop torturing yourself. You don't want a baby.
If you did you'd have one by now.
演唱者 Rare Monk
You're moving it.
I swear, I'm not!
Come on, you guys, someone is definitely moving this.
This can't be real.
We need to ask like a test question,
something nobody knows the answer to.
OK, I've got one.
Will I ever have a boyfriend?
Now who's moving it?
OK, wait, I've gotta know who.
What is the name of my first boyfriend?
Who's Z?
Zac.
OK, you know what, I'm good.
This is just a silly board game.
You two "communicate with the spirit world" all you want,
I'm done.
Hey, babe, what are you doing?
Stef, if you are reading that article,
please don't do that now. It's just gonna make you upset.
I'm already upset, Lena, so let it be, please.
Well...
That was...
...something.
Are you mad at her? You've been short with her all day.
I think Lena is trying to get pregnant.
Or thinking about it, anyway.
Now, with all you have going on?
I think so.
I mean but...
How?
Is she having an affair?
No, Mom!
And what's worse is, she's just not talking to me about it.
Well, if she won't come to you, sweetheart...
...you gotta go to her.
What am I supposed to say, Mom? We can't have a baby.
演唱者 Rosi Golan
So what's up with you and Callie?
Are you guys like a couple now?
Is that why she's getting her own apartment and everything?
Uh, no. No.
No, she just wants to be on her own.
You sure about that?
Well aren't you a love for helping out.
Sweetheart, forgive my candor, but...
...I understand that you've decided
that you don't want to be adopted anymore.
Well, yeah. I'm 16.
I don't need to be adopted.
Family isn't just until you're 18, you know.
You need them your whole life.
Especially at times like these.
No, no, no, don't knot that.
You'll never get that out.
No, Mom.
No!
You don't get to do that anymore.
I love you and you're my mother,
but your experience is yours and my experience is mine.
I am no longer interested
in hearing what you have to say about it,
unless it's, "I love you and I understand."
Well...
I didn't realize I was doing that. I apologize.
I never... I never meant to take anything away from you.
I'm very proud of you, for saying all that.
I just don't know why it took you so long.
You just can't help yourself, can you?
What do you want from me?
Well, since now we're being totally honest,
isn't there something that you need to say to your wife?
Something about a baby?
Oh, my God, you suck!
Are you gonna get that?
No, I'll call her later.
Hey, what are you...? Hey.
Hey, I was just calling to see how the funeral went.
Uh, sorry,
I didn't know you had company.
Who's this?
Hi, I'm Emma.
Hi.
Jesus told me that there was a girl on the wrestling team.
But you are not what I was expecting.
I get that a lot. People think to be a wrestler
you have to be built like a Mac truck or something.
No, I mean, I didn't...
Yeah, I guess that is what I was thinking.
"To"? What does that mean?
"Toy"?
Do you think they're trying to tell us
that the Ouija board is just a toy, and that we shouldn't play with it?
No, I don't think so.
Oh my God! Frank just gave us a new Toyota.
He got you a new car?
Stef is making us give it away.
Why?
Maybe he wants us to keep it.
You didn't push it?
Can we do one more?
Yeah, sure.
Mom. Are you there?
Mom...
...is it OK if Stef and Lena adopt me?
And now for the pastry.
Are you kidding me?
What's the matter?
These are Dodger cupcakes,
they're supposed to be Padres cupcakes. Oh, my...
I didn't check the box before...
My dad hated the Dodgers. This is ridiculous.
I'll just go pick up some plain ones.
You know what? They're cupcakes. This is stupid.
I'll just put them out like this.
Go Padres!
Callie, what's wrong?
My necklace.
I lost my necklace.
Um... I guess the clasp must've broken.
The little gold coin thingy? Were you wearing it today?
I wear it every day.
Stay calm and retrace your steps.
I've been all over the house, the backyard.
When did you last see it?
Um, I don't know, this afternoon, I think.
It'll be OK, we'll find it.
I lost my wedding ring once in the trash.
That was a day to remember, I'll tell you.
What's going on?
Uh, Callie misplaced her necklace.
I didn't misplace it, OK, I lost it! I'm stupid.
Callie, honey,
I'm sorry, but if you lost it we can just replace it.
Please don't! Just leave me alone please.
It was our mom's necklace.
Callie, it's OK.
It's not.
Callie, you're freaking me out.
You're acting like you did when we found out that Mom died.
What are you talking about?
When you destroyed your room.
That was you, Jude.
You destroyed my room.
No, Callie.
It was you.
Oh, my God.
Jude, can I have a minute with Callie please.
Lena was only trying to help, you know.
I know, I'm sorry.
Honey, that necklace is not your mom.
I know that it's important to you.
It's the only thing of her I have left.
No, it's not, honey.
You have her and all those memories.
And those are never gonna get lost.
Sit down, have a seat.
Talk to me.
You know, you have...
You've never said one word about her, your mom.
Tell me about this woman who created...
...the amazing girl sitting in front of me, please.
I didn't kiss her goodbye.
You what?
And... I nev...
The night she died, I didn't.
Oh, Callie.
I should've kissed her goodbye.
Baby. Oh, honey.
Let it go.
You know, the last thing I said to my dad was to
pretty much take the car and shove it.
It's hard to lose someone you love
and you never ever want to feel that pain again.
Now the problem with that is,
the only way to make sure that doesn't happen
is you shut yourself off.
And you stop loving. That's no way to live.
I know it's scary to open yourself back up again.
Do you know that most of the time...
...I feel like I have five separate hearts,
running around outside of me.
It's you kids.
Thanks for making that koodle or whatever you call it.
Kugel. And you're welcome, even though you didn't even try it.
I promise, when I get back inside I'm gonna try it.
It was nice meeting all your family.
Now I know why you're so bizarre.
Really? Says the girl who's on the wrestling team.
Lexi seems nice.
Yeah, she's great.
So... Is she coming back?
I mean, how long is she gonna be in Honduras?
I don't know.
I'll... I'll see you at practice tomorrow?
Okay.
Thanks for letting me crash your funeral.
Bye.
Well, I think it's time I took my leave.
Thank you very much. You have a lovely home.
Thank you.
You know, to be honest, I'm surprised you came.
Well, people's attitudes evolve, Stef.
Even your father.
He came to me very often, trying to reconcile his faith with...
your lifestyle.
It was very difficult for him.
So am I supposed to be happy about that?
That your father was questioning his fundamental beliefs
because of his love for you?
Yes.
I should think that would make you happy.
Well, I should get home. Thank you so much.
Frank was very important to me, and to all of us at church.
And you have a beautiful family.
Yeah.
Hi, captain.
I'm sorry. Am I too late?
No, no, no.
I had to go down to the station.
It's fine. Why don't you grab some dessert or something, OK?
OK.
Hey, Mike.
Captain.
So I got a courtesy call from the DA's office.
That article in the paper today has really stirred the pot.
There's been a ton of public outcry...
Um... Well, look, he's decided to
start an investigation, to see if he can press charges.
What?
We're gonna do everything we can,
and the union will make sure to provide you with...
Provide a lawyer if I need one?
God! This is unbelievable!
I thought this was supposed to go away.
I was supposed to go back to work.
Now what? I could end up going to jail?
Not if I have anything to say about it.
The problem is, you don't, captain.
You found it?
Yeah.
You're my hero.
演唱者 Adrianne Gonzalez
I love you, Brandon.
I love you, too.
But...
I know.
I know.
I need a family.
And this, you, all of you,
you are my family.
So I don't think that we can do this anymore.
You know?
I never realized until today
that for us to be together, you have to give up everything.
And that's not really fair of me to ask.
Brandon?
Uh, yeah, Grandma.
I was wondering if you might come in and play a little something?
It's so quiet in there, you'd think it was a funeral.
Yeah. Sure.
What are you wearing?
It's Frank's. I was cold.
I kinda wanted him to be buried in it.
But I'm glad we didn't. I think I'll keep it though.
He was wearing this the last time he told me he loved me.
So you gonna come in and play a little something for ol' Frank?
Yeah.
What about you, Callie, you coming?
Uh, I think I'm just gonna...
...stay out here a minute, if it's OK.
Sure. You all right, doll?
I am.
You found Mom's necklace?
Yeah.
I'm coming home, Jude.
I wanna come home.
I need you kids to pack a bag.
We're gonna take you to stay with a very nice family
called the Segals for a little while.
What about our dad?
Your dad is in jail.
He was drinking before the accident,
and several people, including your mom, were killed.
You're not gonna split us up, are you?
'Cause I won't leave my brother.
We're not gonna separate you, I promise.
We're gonna keep you together
until we can find a home for you both.
Where's Mom?
I think she went out front.
Thank you for the car, Dad. It's gonna be a lifesaver.
I can't believe I'm saying this
but I'm gonna miss the hell out of you.
I know you did the best that you could,
best way you knew how.
And I want you to know that I forgive you.
I love you, Daddy.
Go Padres.
It's snowing.
Yeah.
So...
Do you wanna have a baby?
