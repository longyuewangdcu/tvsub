hello ?
i am armed ...
with a @-@ with a big gun .
oh , my--
oh , god .
at least do it with a little authority .
someone &apos;s going to think i raised a pussy .
you scared the crap out of me .
how did you get here ?
i live in a nursing home , not a prison .
they have a shuttle service
and a very muscular driver named donald .
grammy , i &apos;m making a lot of money right now .
i could have sent a car for you .
then , i wouldn &apos;t have gotten
to see a very muscular driver named donald .
why didn &apos;t you call ? i could have been here .
oh , my god .
our dinner .
i have been working so hard , i forgot what day it is .
that used to happen to dad .
that &apos;s what happens when you care about your job .
and don &apos;t give a rat &apos;s ass about your grandmother .
well , yeah , that is why i put you in the home .
good morning , everyone .
before we get down to business , i would like to offer
a big welcome back to daniel hardman .
we &apos;re thrilled to have you home .
now , moving on ...
i &apos;m sorry , jessica .
before you do that , i want to say one thing .
while i am delighted to be back ,
i want to be clear . nothing &apos;s changing .
jessica is still the head of this firm .
i &apos;m here in a number two capacity .
just think of me like a seasoned advisor .
like bill to hillary if she &apos;d won .
thank you , daniel . moving on .
prescott hospitals &apos; negotiation with their nurses &apos; union .
nobody wants a strike .
i &apos;m going to need someone who &apos;s going to bring this home .
therefore ...
not to jump in here too quick ,
but i did bring prescott into the firm .
i &apos;m your man .
what i was going to say is i brought harvey up to
speed on this last night .
he &apos;s got it covered .
been prepping all morning .
really ? the whole morning ?
i learn fast .
maybe i could still help . mind if i take a look ?
later .
jessica likes to keep these meetings headlines only .
i &apos;ll swing by your office .
sounds like a plan .
next order of business .
nurses &apos; strike assigned to me last night ?
goddamn daniel .
picked up right where he left off .
trying to cut my legs out .
why are you grinning ?
i &apos;m just glad to have someone
in the room who pisses you off more than i do .
you know why i picked you , right ?
because you knew i &apos;d roll with your lie .
because you need a chance to get out of the doghouse .
i got your tea service for you .
you think that &apos;s going to cut it ?
what do you want me to do ?
put him in his place .
it &apos;s a can opener . what ?
paying for your sins of last night ?
i wish you hadn &apos;t said that .
why not ?
&apos;cause i spent the night with my grandmother .
is she hot ?
what is wrong with you ?
you started it .
i most certainly did not .
prescott hospital .
i need a complete summary
of their nurses &apos; union negotiation .
from whom ?
rachel ?
no . no , it &apos;s too soon . i--
i broke it off before we even started . no .
tell her about the exciting night
you spent with your grandmother .
trust me .
she &apos;ll realize she dodged a bullet .
and i need four bullshit pro bono cases right now .
i don &apos;t have any pro bono files .
i &apos;m a corporate lawyer . that &apos;s what we do here .
i do it on my own time .
thanks , rachel .
wait a minute .
why are you asking me for case files ?
i &apos;m not allowed to say .
harvey asked mike , and he was too afraid ?
like a baby girl .
you okay ?
no .
but i am too busy to do anything
other than throw myself
into this stack of work anyhow .
well ...
as long as you &apos;re making healthy choices .
yeah .
make yourself at home .
you know , i can see myself in this thing .
i would find that really distracting , of course .
i &apos;m swooning .
i thought the plan was to meet in your office .
i thought i &apos;d save us some time .
this is a child custody dispute .
little lenny . so sad .
you need props to make your point ?
you said you changed .
why don &apos;t you prove it by doing some good ?
harvey , i have changed .
but i don &apos;t have to prove anything to you .
not as long as you sit in this office
and pretend to practice law .
but when you stick your nose in my cases ,
that &apos;s another story .
if you haven &apos;t noticed , my name is on the door .
they &apos;re all my cases .
the name of this firm is pearson hardman .
you said it yourself , you &apos;re number two .
i answer to number one .
no matter who you answer to ,
one way or another ,
you will learn to treat me with respect .
fine .
i respect you , but i don &apos;t work for you .
and i sure as hell don &apos;t work with you .
pick up the phone . little lenny deserves the best .
you know the head of the nurses &apos; union
isn &apos;t a lawyer but a nurse , right ?
what &apos;s your point ?
what if you get schooled by a hot nurse ?
what are you , 12 ?
what , you can talk about my grandmother ,
but i can &apos;t make a nurse joke ?
yup .
actually , i was 12
when i had my first caregiver fantasy .
let me guess . nurse ratched .
say what you will .
you had a kind of stocky hotness .
listen , our goal is to reach a fair agreement
between a hospital and its nurses .
there are no winners .
did you have a stroke ? there &apos;s always a winner .
of course there &apos;s a winner .
just needed to make sure
you were ready to stick it to the nurses .
don &apos;t say it .
negotiator number five .
meet the new boss . same as the old boss .
jameson was our last negotiator . trust me .
i &apos;m not jameson .
that &apos;s what he said about the one before him .
you &apos;re all the same to me .
i &apos;m over here , you &apos;re over here .
well , let &apos;s see if we can &apos;t--
you &apos;re going to have to buy me dinner first .
i can do better .
you &apos;re expecting me to offer you this .
you &apos;re willing to settle on this .
you &apos;re praying for this .
well , your prayers have been answered .
you know , i &apos;ll even buy you breakfast in the morning .
not so fast , blondie .
prescott hospitals is hurting as much as anyone else .
you push any harder ,
they &apos;re going to go out of business , and nobody wins .
this is the best you &apos;re going to do .
and it &apos;s a deal you &apos;re ready to take .
we were ready .
but what about the new account you funded yesterday ?
yeah , that &apos;s right . i know about it .
this isn &apos;t my first rodeo .
then you also know that money &apos;s off the table .
money &apos;s fungible . everything &apos;s on the table .
i &apos;m sorry ,
but that account was funded by donors specifically
for the development of new robotics for surgery .
i used to change bedpans for a living , junior .
i know what bullshit smells like .
this isn &apos;t bullshit .
even if prescott wanted to give that money to the nurses ,
they couldn &apos;t , legally .
so they &apos;re willing to raise money
for equipment but not nurses ?
i get it .
nurses are sexy , but nurses aren &apos;t sexy .
well , you need to find a way to get us access to that money ,
or we don &apos;t have a deal .
that &apos;s not going to happen .
well , then we &apos;re done .
you leave this table , it means only one thing .
i know exactly what it means .
we have a fully funded strike fund ,
and we &apos;re going to use it .
we reject your proposal .
reminder : ask harold to dye his hair .
orange is the color of a clown .
no , strike that . harold is a clown .
annual survey of associates came out .
pearson hardman ranked second to last in quality of life .
who beat us ?
louis , i know you take great pride in
making the associates &apos; lives miserable .
well , i did until the survey said i was second best at it .
you &apos;re missing the point .
harvard wants to rescind our on @-@ campus recruiting privileges .
what ?
wait . pearson hardman is harvard .
harvard is pearson hardman .
one can &apos;t survive without the other .
there &apos;s no need for histrionics just yet .
histrionics ?
this is the gravest day i &apos;ve ever known .
jessica , let me handle this .
why do you think i &apos;m here ?
screw you .
mine likes to be scolded too .
i keep getting these dating site pop @-@ ups .
it &apos;s like my computer &apos;s accusing me of being single .
do you know why it &apos;s doing that ?
my mother &apos;s in there ?
did you search for a dating site ?
no .
when ?
last week .
you , me , happy hour ,
harvey &apos;s corporate card .
are you crazy ?
you want to leave the office at 5 : 00 ?
oh , don &apos;t be ridiculous .
happy hour starts at 4 : 00 .
it &apos;s a bad idea .
you &apos;re never going to get an injunction
to stop the strike outright .
you read that in a book ,
or is that what your five minutes
practicing law have to say ?
not a book but every labor decision
from the last ten years .
but i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s a safer bet
arguing for the temporary restraining order .
first of all , a t.r.o. delays a strike ,
an injunction stops it , and i want to stop it .
second of all ...
never use that phrase &quot; safer bet &quot; with me again .
safer bet .
you know what ?
you don &apos;t deserve the privilege of seeing me win .
i &apos;ve gathered you all here to ask you
just one simple question .
do any of you have the desire to strip down
and exchange underwear with each other ?
any takers ?
no ?
well , of course not because you don &apos;t want
to air your dirty laundry in public , right ?
but evidently , you did .
and while i &apos;m personally proud of the fact
that you &apos;re all unhappy , harvard is not .
so i &apos;ve invited a representative from the law school
to see firsthand how joyful you all are
under my tutelage .
so you want us to lie ?
no .
i want you to convince this woman
that pearson hardman makes you shit rainbows .
is that clear ?
yeah .
you sure ?
anyone else have any other stupid questions ?
i figures .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m here on behalf of pearson hardman .
as much as i appreciate a fan club ,
this hearing starts in five minutes ,
which means you &apos;ve got four minutes to get out of here .
daniel .
i &apos;m prepared to rule on your motion .
what do you think it &apos;s going to be ?
t.r.o. granted .
finally , you rule one for me .
don &apos;t give me any grief about the feinberg suit .
your precedents sucked . this one &apos;s legit .
it &apos;s good to have you back , daniel .
thank you for moving me up on the docket , judge .
what the hell was that ?
i believe it was a victory .
hey , you don &apos;t reschedule my hearings .
were you in there ?
&apos;cause i do .
the truth is you should be thanking me .
well , would you like me to thank your face with my fist ?
if you would have consulted with me first ,
like i offered , i could have told you
garvin steiner was never going to grant an injunction .
not when his wednesday golf buddy shows up
and hijacks the courtroom .
say what you will . i know the man .
0 % chance he gives you what you want .
daniel , maybe you don &apos;t know how it works these days .
when i &apos;m on a case ,
the only thing there &apos;s 0 % chance of
is me losing .
harvey , i said i &apos;ve changed .
don &apos;t mistake that change for weakness .
i told you , my name &apos;s on the door .
didn &apos;t get there by me taking shit from the likes of you .
you want to work together on this ,
i &apos;m open to it .
you don &apos;t ,
this is how it &apos;s going to be .
so let me get this straight .
the judge ruled against your idea ,
and so you went with my idea ?
not exactly . hardman got the t.r.o.
okay , so you told me i was wrong ,
and yet i had the same idea as a managing partner .
that &apos;s funny , that kind of makes me wonder
what else you &apos;ve been wrong about .
hiring you ?
daniel and i wouldn &apos;t concur with that .
hey , handsome .
your bearded buddy was already here .
you can shut us down for 48 hours ,
but we can still prepare to strike .
actually , i came over to extend an olive branch .
why don &apos;t you go ahead and start your strike right now ?
you looked into our finances , i looked into yours .
your strike fund has enough to last a week .
we &apos;re not even going to have a meeting about it for a month .
we know what we &apos;re getting into .
we &apos;re prepared .
well , prepare yourself for this :
our last offer &apos;s off the table .
the new offer is the one we gave you before that .
and every day you strike ,
it &apos;s going to keep getting worse .
harvey , you do realize you just littered , right ?
they can pick it up . they &apos;re not working .
it &apos;ll give them a sense of purpose .
you don &apos;t think you &apos;re being a little harsh ?
i just put an end to a situation
our client can &apos;t afford and those nurses can &apos;t either .
trust me , they &apos;ll cave .
everyone .
i would like you to meet
ms. sheila zass from our beloved harvard law .
while i appreciate the introduction ,
i would have appreciated even more
a little discretion .
i &apos;m here to make an assessment ,
which would have been aided by anonymity .
fly . wall .
loud and clear .
and by the way , it &apos;s sazs . s @-@ a @-@ z @-@ s .
yeah , that &apos;s what i said . sheila zass .
never mind .
do you see what i see ?
there &apos;s two of them .
i think louis is attracted to female louis .
do you think that if they touch ,
the world would cease to exist ?
i don &apos;t want to think about them touching .
there &apos;s my favorite litigation girl .
olivia , what &apos;s up ?
james , gordon brief , just going to say it ,
it was a gift to the law .
see , this is what i like to do , basically .
i like to , uh , you know , sit here
once a week , make myself accessible ,
get to know the troops
on a , you know , personal level .
and what has that process yielded ?
well , harold has a mother ...
aunt .
who tragically died of heart disease .
cancer .
we &apos;re all with him .
i think i &apos;ve seen enough .
clearly , you don &apos;t know that person very well .
so unless you want to find yourself
recruiting suny binghamton ,
you &apos;ll treat me with a little more respect .
you really cut me to the quick .
yes , i do not know him on a personal level , thank god .
but i don &apos;t think that &apos;s relevant .
i have 20 underlings .
i don &apos;t know a single person &apos;s last name .
god , i admire you .
what do you need from us to keep our privileges ?
what do you think i need ?
talk to each one of them individually .
bingo .
pick a man .
that one .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
people say i &apos;m emotionally unavailable .
i got us 48 hours , and you threw it away .
no .
you gave them two days to negotiate
with the threat of a strike hanging over our heads .
i took the only bullet they had out of the chamber .
and now that bullet is headed right at us .
they have an offer in front of them ,
and they &apos;re going to sign it .
you don &apos;t know that .
yes , i do .
well , you better be right because if either one of us
picks up the phone right now , we &apos;ll be the ones who caved .
then we might as well tell them
they can have everything .
finally , we &apos;re on the same page .
welcome to the team .
we &apos;re not on the same page .
you backed us into a corner .
i didn &apos;t do shit .
nell sawyer put us into that position .
i gave her the best offer we could afford .
and if this strike drags on , prescott goes down .
and none of us can afford that .
this strike never would have happened in the first place
if i had gotten an injunction
instead of the t.r.o.
by the way , that piece of genius ,
same idea my associate had .
kid &apos;s smart , but he &apos;s never been around the block .
you have . stop thinking like a rookie .
okay , let me guess .
the reason that you haven &apos;t signed up yet
is that you want me to help you
take some sexy pictures for your profile .
you &apos;re hoping that one thing leads to another and ...
bow @-@ chicka bow @-@ wow ?
no .
the reason i haven &apos;t signed up yet
is because they have you fill out this form ,
and it asks you to write down who you are .
and who i am is a paralegal .
rachel , i am a legal secretary ,
and i am proud of it .
but when somebody asks me who i am ,
that is not the first thing that comes to mind .
yeah , but i don &apos;t have anything else , you know ?
i kidded myself about becoming a lawyer ,
and i kidded myself about mike .
so the truth is i am just a lonely paralegal .
and that &apos;s a tough thing to write down .
well , you &apos;re not a lonely paralegal tonight .
we &apos;re lawyers .
pearson hardman .
i &apos;m harriet specter , and this is my associate .
michelle ross .
i &apos;ve got a photographic memory .
pretty much a legal superhero .
i &apos;m a closer .
i &apos;m the best goddamn closer this town has ever seen .
what are you looking at ?
i can recite the constitution
forwards , backwards , and sideways
&apos;cause i read it once when i was seven .
i don &apos;t buy it . recite it right now .
cheers .
cheers .
i &apos;m a flame thrower .
surgeon .
acrobat .
professor ... of law .
i &apos;m a rabbi .
oh , my god . what the hell did you order ?
you wanted to see me , mr. hardman ?
please . call me daniel .
sit down .
first of all , i want to tell you
harvey speaks very highly of you .
he does ?
well , it &apos;s harvey .
so you have to read between the lines .
what did he say ?
that i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m not a complete idiot ?
something like that .
he also told me that you and i
had the same idea to go after a t.r.o.
he told me that too .
why did you think it was the right move ?
it put a clock on the negotiations
and kept both sides at the table .
i thought so too .
but whether i agreed with him at the time or not ,
i &apos;m not going against him now .
but he and i do agree on this point :
his decision puts us in a bit of a pickle .
because we can &apos;t go back to ms. sawyer
and ask exactly what she needs to close the deal .
harvey and i can &apos;t .
but i can .
so you are smart .
i &apos;m afraid so .
you &apos;ll have to forgive me for not completely
trusting harvey &apos;s assessment ,
but i needed to make sure
that our back channel negotiator was up to the task .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s not here .
coach doesn &apos;t let dad come to the tryouts .
what do you need me to do ?
they sent you ?
which means they &apos;re not serious about talking .
ms. sawyer , please . listen to me .
you are on strike ,
and they are never going to flinch .
so what harm is there in talking to me ?
why should i trust you ?
well , that &apos;s why i wanted you to meet me here .
nell ,
this is my grandmother , edith ross .
hello .
a proud resident of a prescott nursing home .
this is not just another case for me .
yeah , and he didn &apos;t just stick me
in here last night to make that point .
he locked me in here months ago .
grammy .
now , easy , michael .
i &apos;m helping you out here .
by the way ,
you &apos;re a bit of a hero to my favorite nurse .
really ? well , that &apos;s nice to hear .
he never shuts up about you .
i can &apos;t take one pill in peace .
edith , i &apos;m glad you brought up the topic of pills .
because i need to give your grandson a little lesson .
you mind ?
no .
let &apos;s see here .
plavix , zestril ,
hygroton , atenolol .
you know what happens when they &apos;re not kept straight ?
not good .
who do you think does that ? doctors ?
nurses .
imagine your grandmother &apos;s nurse
just finished a 15 @-@ hour shift .
she needs her medicine in exactly two hours .
we &apos;re understaffed .
that nurse is going to stay .
he won &apos;t even sign a time card for it
because he won &apos;t get paid .
but if his name shows up on this chart ,
he stayed .
happens every day .
you ask me what i want ?
i want enough money , so it never happens again .
that one &apos;s a dud .
you have no idea .
mm .
ms. sazs .
mr. litt .
louis .
sheila .
i feel as though i &apos;m talking to a--
kindred spirit ?
yes .
i know .
me too .
level with me .
i &apos;ll be brutally honest .
that &apos;s the only language i speak .
i &apos;m going to allow you to maintain your recruiting privileges
because of the man i believe you to be .
and i believe myself to be that same man .
but you &apos;ve got bigger problems .
your associates don &apos;t respect you .
they think you don &apos;t work as hard as they do .
what ?
they think you make them do your work .
you realize i &apos;m only telling you this
because i think that they &apos;re wrong .
they are wrong .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me .
i did it .
did what ?
you and daniel are going to be so proud of me .
why don &apos;t you let me be the judge of that ?
judge all you want .
judge away because i saw nell on my own ,
even used my grandmother @-@ not used .
she was onboard with it @-@ that &apos;s weird .
maintaining your integrity , i like it .
continue .
so it turns out
that the nurses are consistently staying late
to give the patients the right meds
even though they &apos;re not being paid for it .
and you bought that ?
yeah , i bought that .
because i checked my grandmother &apos;s chart .
if it &apos;s true for her , it &apos;s true for others .
oh , you didn &apos;t let me finish .
turns out , that all they want is enough staff
so that nobody ever has to work
more than a 15 @-@ hour shift again .
and how much is that going to cost ?
10 % of the new equipment fund . nailed it .
so all we need to do
is find a legal way to get at that money .
yeah , so do you want me to go
tell daniel how proud you are of me ,
or do we do that together later ?
have , like , a group thing ?
i &apos;ll give him the good news .
wash all you want . the lies aren &apos;t coming off .
i told you i changed . i didn &apos;t say i became a nun .
you lied to my associate .
i never specifically said anything that wasn &apos;t true .
people hear what they want to hear .
you deceived your own .
you never lied to anyone else here ?
jessica , the other partners , me ?
not since you &apos;ve been back .
really ?
when did jessica assign you this case ?
you lied to me .
but i didn &apos;t come to the bathroom and cry about it .
no , you sent my associate to go crying to the other side .
so he got us a final number .
he got a number , but it &apos;s not going to be final .
we offer them $ 10 million ,
the next day it &apos;s going to be $ 15 million .
we needed to hold strong to get them to close .
says your gut , and i don &apos;t practice law based on your gut .
my gut didn &apos;t burn through five negotiators .
nell sawyer did .
so you think we should never budge .
i know we should never budge ,
but you screwed that when you sent mike
to tell them we would .
congratulations , daniel .
we may be a couple of liars ,
but only one of us is going to be responsible
when this whole thing goes to shit .
you wanted to see me ?
we &apos;ll get going in a minute .
once i start , i have to finish .
i &apos;ve always hated these things .
a filthy habit .
my daughter was 15,
i caught her smoking , and i hit the roof .
but then my wife got sick .
and then when the cancer got to her lungs ,
once a week , we would share a cigarette .
give it the finger .
monday nights at 9 : 00 .
i can &apos;t stop .
i don &apos;t want to stop .
uh , we should really figure out a way
to get at this equipment fund .
it &apos;s going to be a long night .
that &apos;s okay .
i don &apos;t really have much of a social life .
me either .
barbaric .
norma , the scofield subpoena is missing
an entire class of subcontracts .
please amend it
to include anything after 2010 .
oh , and send sheila a basket of flowers .
thank @-@ you flowers , not romantic flowers .
let things take their natural course .
can &apos;t you just keep a diary like every other 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl ?
not tonight , harvey .
just go home .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
i &apos;m just catching up on some work .
in the bullpen ?
apparently , the associates
don &apos;t believe that i work as hard as they do .
what ?
louis , anyone who doesn &apos;t think
you &apos;re the hardest @-@ working lawyer at this firm is an idiot .
you may be a dick , but as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
the associates have it pretty good .
thank you , harvey .
dick part aside .
remember when we were in here ?
what we had to do ?
like it was yesterday .
i can still hear hardman reaming me out
for losing that dunridge file .
you were sitting right here .
i was so scared .
i thought i &apos;d be fired right on the spot .
i hid it .
i knew it ! i knew it !
i had to work 48 hours straight just to recreate it .
yeah , but we killed it at trial .
yeah , if that happened now ,
i wouldn &apos;t hear the end of it .
i know .
god forbid they have to pull one all @-@ nighter ,
let alone two .
it &apos;s like they think there &apos;s this law
against working more than 20 hours a day .
well , there isn &apos;t . prima donnas .
i should fire them all right now and start from scratch .
louis ,
i &apos;m only going to say this once , so you better enjoy it .
you &apos;re the man .
you &apos;re the man .
you &apos;re the man .
harvey , did you say somebody &apos;s the man ?
you &apos;re the man .
thanks . appreciate it .
who &apos;s the man ?
you &apos;re the man .
you know it .
what did you say ?
you &apos;re the man .
damn straight .
what are you doing ?
oh , uh , god .
i &apos;m sorry . this--this looks awful .
i &apos;m working with hardman .
he needed a file , and i--
why didn &apos;t you just send donna ?
okay . i deserve that .
rachel , i swear , i didn &apos;t mean to--
oh , don &apos;t look at me like that .
it &apos;s not porn . it &apos;s match.com.
so you &apos;re , uh .
yeah .
i am .
that &apos;s good .
it is .
i think it &apos;s , uh , good .
yeah , me too .
except that i have been working
on this essay for the past three days ,
and this is all i &apos;ve got .
it &apos;s blank .
i know .
okay , how about you start with something like this :
&quot; i work at the top firm in manhattan . &quot;
see , that &apos;s not really ...
&quot; i have an office ,
&quot; which is unheard of for a paralegal .
that shows how much they value me . &quot;
just hold on .
okay , more .
&quot; i &apos;m passionate .
&quot; funny , tenacious .
courageous . &quot;
any more adjectives ?
&quot; supercalifragilisticexpialidocious .
i &apos;m incredibly smart , sometimes aggressively so . &quot;
you realize this is supposed to make me sound good , right ?
why don &apos;t you let me finish ?
&quot; i &apos;m a--
&quot; i &apos;m also a kind person .
&quot; and i want someone who notices the little things ,
&quot; like--like the fact that i &apos;m a foodie ,
&quot; and i love to share that with other people .
&quot; or that when someone pays me a compliment ,
&quot; i can &apos;t even look them in the eye ,
&quot; or the fact that my parents are obviously loaded ,
but i &apos;m still determined to make it on my own . &quot;
i &apos;m not going to type that last part .
hey , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you &apos;re still going to be beating them away with a stick .
well , yeah , because you write such a--such a good essay .
no , i mean , after you post a picture here .
barbinger file , done .
scofield subpoena , done .
johnson strategy , written .
every single one of your assignments
was completed by me last night .
what else do we have left to do ?
uh , file it ?
filing .
doc review , spell check .
grunt work ?
yes , grunt work . because that &apos;s your job .
let it be known that i can do your work faster
and better than any one of you without shedding a tear
or breaking a sweat ,
but i don &apos;t because
writing briefs and recommending arguments
is how you learn .
you go out to any other firm right now
at this stage of your career , you won &apos;t have this opportunity .
if you don &apos;t believe me ,
i will write you the best recommendation you have ever seen ,
and you can find out for yourself .
go ahead .
any takers ?
that &apos;s what i thought .
now i have ten new cases here .
who wants in ?
what are you guys waiting for ? come and get them .
excellent work last night , mike .
thanks .
whoa , you didn &apos;t tell me you were bringing her in .
who do you think the proposal was for ?
does harvey even know about this meeting ?
as a matter of fact , i do .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a pink slip .
50 pink slips , in fact .
for 50 nurses .
excuse me ?
it &apos;s come to my attention these nurses have been
working past their 15 @-@ hour shift .
and they don &apos;t put it on their time card ,
but they still sign charts ,
which happens to release them from the protection of federal labor law .
you &apos;re bluffing .
i found these 50 in one night .
how many do you think i &apos;ll find in a week ?
there &apos;s a way out of this .
sign the contract .
your grandmother would be proud .
you have until the end of the day .
harvey !
let me guess .
you &apos;re upset .
i got you that information through my grandmother .
your idea , not mine .
look , i know you might have been hatched in a pod ,
but family actually means something to me .
and i gave you that information to help the nurses ,
not strong @-@ arm them .
were you okay with the first deal we presented to nell ?
that is not the point .
that &apos;s exactly the point .
because this is a contract that our client can actually afford .
harvey .
enough .
you think i was joking when i asked if you were ready
to stick it to the nurses ?
i wasn &apos;t .
i know you don &apos;t like this part of the job ,
but it &apos;s part of the job .
if prescott gives in to their demands ,
they go out of business , the nurses get nothing ,
it &apos;s a win @-@ win .
that &apos;s bullshit .
it &apos;s a win because you beat daniel .
i work with him , i work with you ,
i work with him @-@ it doesn &apos;t take a genius
to figure out that you &apos;re playing each other ,
and you &apos;re using me to do it .
but you know what ,
i don &apos;t care what &apos;s going on between the two of you ,
but i don &apos;t want to be caught in the middle of it ever again .
grammy , if that &apos;s you , i swear to god ,
i &apos;m going to have the locks changed .
rachel .
you hurt me .
i &apos;m sorry .
no .
all those nice things you said ,
those are the kinds of things you say when you--
look , if you feel those things about me ,
why can &apos;t you be with me ?
i told you , you know , it &apos;s--it &apos;s work
and @-@ and that guy .
it &apos;s everything , you know ?
i just--i don &apos;t think it would work .
i think it would be a mistake .
yeah , you know what ? you did say that .
and it &apos;s a lot of bullshit because the mike that i know
and the mike that i fell for @-@ he wouldn &apos;t do this .
and if all of your feelings are still there ,
then it only points to one thing .
and it &apos;s that you &apos;re keeping something from me .
i don &apos;t want to lie to you .
then don &apos;t .
please , just--
just tell me what it is .
i thought so .
rachel ...
i &apos;m done .
rachel . rachel , wait !
rachel !
rachel , stop . please , let me explain .
how ?
look , i want to tell you .
then tell me .
i can &apos;t .
why ? i mean , what could it possibly be ?
you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re married ?
you &apos;re some kind of spy ?
no , you don &apos;t understand .
look , once i tell you , i can never take it back .
this is my everything .
i can &apos;t .
did you have fun ?
i wouldn &apos;t say fun .
you celebrating winning the case or beating me ?
two for the price of one .
jessica loves a bargain .
you here for another round ?
no .
i &apos;m not here to start a fight . i &apos;m here to apologize for one .
the partner meeting @-@ you were welcoming me back .
but i saw you sitting there in my old chair ,
and i just--
i &apos;m sorry .
his words sound good .
only one problem .
you were starting stuff before you even got here .
gifts to everyone , digging into cases ,
constructing a new office .
that was all part of coming back .
not furnishing it with my tea set .
that &apos;s what this is about ?
don &apos;t you remember where you got that tea set ?
alicia gave it to you .
and i took it because i missed her .
i &apos;m sorry .
i thought you would understand that .
i need a copy of the final agreement the nurses signed .
yup , got it right here .
thank you .
you look different .
new clothes . hair like that .
you have a date .
good night , donna .
good night , rachel .
mind if i come in ?
uh , truth be told ,
i was taking off for the afternoon .
late night ?
nothing i can &apos;t handle .
i believe it .
i heard your speech to the associates .
and i just wanted to tell you how impressed i was .
thank you .
i always knew you were the right man for the job ,
so it feels good to see it in action .
something wrong ?
no .
louis .
if you really heard me in there ,
you &apos;d know that i give them the chance
to rise to the occasion .
and i just wish every once in a while ,
you might maybe do the same for me .
you wanted to see me ?
yeah , mike . sit down .
i wanted to tell you a story
that i should have told you the day daniel came back .
when jessica and i found out
that daniel was embezzling from clients ,
we confronted him .
he broke down .
he said his wife had cancer ,
and he needed the money to try and save her life .
turns out , he needed the money
to support his mistress .
now he &apos;s saying he &apos;s different .
but a man who would do that
is a man i find very difficult to trust .
do you trust me ?
that &apos;s what i wanted you to know .
is this your first time ?
no . i &apos;m just ...
trying to forget about the other times .
start fresh .
look , i don &apos;t mean to be rude .
i just really want to concentrate .
you have three hours to complete the exam .
good luck . your time starts now .
three times in one week .
i might have to write you back into my will .
what &apos;s wrong ?
plavix ...
stuck in my head , so i looked it up .
something that you take when you have a heart problem .
michael , i &apos;m 82 years old .
i have an everything problem .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
that getting old sucks ?
you &apos;ll find out .
and i don &apos;t tell you every little thing
because i don &apos;t want you to worry .
and if you looked it up , you &apos;d know
that it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s for preventive purposes .
did you read that part ?
yeah , i kind of panicked when i got to the heart problem part .
i hope you do a more thorough job at work .
okay , i make the trip down here
to express some serious concern , and you mock me ?
with love .
okay .
enough of your stupid health problems ,
let &apos;s get down to business , deal with some of my real ones .
you &apos;re young .
you don &apos;t have any real problems .
wrong . i am making way too much money ,
and i don &apos;t have a girlfriend to spend it on .
i know a few single ladies .
really ?
i can &apos;t go older than 70 though . it &apos;s a ground rule .
