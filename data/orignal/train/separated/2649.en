Reddington's missing.
Samar, I need you to trace his location.
The search traced Mr. Reddington's burner
to a location in West Virginia.
You knew where they were. You didn't tell me.
I want you gone by the end of the day.
My father died for his principles.
It was a trap, set by the crookedest cop of all.
Tommy Markin.
Tommy Markin.
I found Karakurt.
Karakurt's willing to confess?
To all of it.
Agent Keen tells me you have Karakurt.
Yes. And I intend on turning him over As soon as possible.
Don't. I have a better idea.
Hasaan is all yours.
You will have your meeting.
I'll be in touch when I'm ready.
We have to give him the care package.
We need it to clear your name.
Elizabeth, no!
Elizabeth Keen, you're under arrest.
Just so you know,
I'm not ashamed of what I did.
You shot the Attorney General of the United States.
He was a terrorist.
He was unarmed.
Well, I'm glad you have your convictions.
I just don't wanna die for them.
You said she'd never be caught.
I'll arrange her transfer to C.I.A. custody.
It won't be that easy.
We haven't put safety measures in place.
Wait, Laurel. Laurel.
You said you took care of the Reven Wright situation.
I did, but certain protocols were set to activate
upon Keen's arrest.
What kind of protocols?
Cynthia Panabaker kind.
Yeah. She's White House counsel, and a real pain in the ass.
She's drafted an executive order mandating Keen's transport
to the federal courthouse for a closed hearing with Judge Trotter.
How much time do we have?
Three hours, maybe less, Peter.
If she tells her story in open court, then --
She won't.
You know, this entire airport novel started
when you overplayed your hand with Raymond Reddington.
It's time for you to close the book on Elizabeth Keen.
Permanently.
Three hours to make one woman go away?
We've collapsed entire governments in less time.
第三季第九集

Ressler.
Where is she?
You don't have to worry about Keen's safety.
I've taken measures to -- - Your measures will fail.
Mine won't.
Oh, so now you're gonna share your plan with me
now that I've arrested your partner in crime?
Face it, Reddington. I beat you.
There are no beatings here, Donald.
No winners or losers. There is only Agent Keen's life.
I have been working on a meticulous campaign
to clear her name.
but I need a day to put one final piece in place.
Go for it. You know where we'll be.
I wish that were true.
But you're about to witness the full force
of a shadow government working in concert to crush you.
And now that they know you have Elizabeth,
they will stop at nothing to steal her.
You and agents Navabi and Mojtabai
must remain by her side and guard her with your lives
until you hear from me again.
Thanks to you,
Navabi's no longer a member of this task force.
Then it's all on you, Donald.
Keep them away from Agent Keen.
And, Donald,
I assume you have Dembe and are being hospitable.
You'll get a fair hearing.
You and I both know I'm never making it to that hearing alive.
I mean, this place should be safe.
You know, there's -- - Yep.
Perfect place to sneak away and be alone.
What's that for? I'm cooperating.
Well, I cut into your chest with an old bean can, my friend.
So I'm not giving you the chance to return the favor.
You got anything to eat around here? I'm starving.
I'm sure Charlene knows her way around the kitchen.
Really, Harold? We gonna do this right now?
I'm driving you to your sister's.
It's not safe around here.
I wanna get you away from Karakurt.
The Cabal will stop at nothing to kill him.
Stay here. Guard the asset.
I'll get back as soon as I can.
Beans?
Agent Mojtabai.
Have you heard about Agent Keen?
Mr. Reddington.
Listen to me, Aram.
The Cabal will come for her.
If they reach her, it'll be the last time
you ever see Elizabeth again.
At this point, only one person can keep her alive. You.
Me? Um...O-okay.
How?
Excellent work, Agent Ressler.
3: 00 p.m., U.S. Marshals will arrive
to escort you to a federal courthouse
where you'll be held pending your arraignment tomorrow.
Whatever happens, I don't blame you.
Until that time you'll be held here
under the authority and protection of Reven Wright.
I'll keep you safe. I promise.
I've called her four times.
How is it possible that you haven't gotten in touch with her?
Listen, when you do,
I want you to get her to call me as soon as possible, understand?
Take him to holding.
Hi, Dembe.
Nobody's heard from Reven Wright since last night.
I don't like this.
You promised me that Agent Keen would receive a fair hearing.
Something's wrong.
Excuse me.
What do you think you're doing?
Oh, Agent Ressler.
Congratulations on your arrest.
We're moving your prisoner.
You don't have the authority.
Homeland has actionable intel from inside Russian borders
that a terrorist attack on U.S. soil is imminent.
Keen is a Russian agent. We need to question her.
I'd like to see a copy of that intel.
Well, I'm afraid you are not cleared.
You know Reven Wright will never allow this.
By the way, where is Mrs. Wright?
I haven't seen or heard from her all day.
Excuse me.
I won't give you the codes.
Oh, you don't need to.
The F.B.I. director can be very helpful
during acts of war.
Almost as if we are all on the same team.
You changed the code.
No.
Find a way into this box.
Agent Ressler. How's our girl?
You were right. I can't protect her.
Slow down and tell me what's happening.
Look, I can't move Keen to the courthouse for another two hours,
but the Director's here with his own transfer order.
It's just luck that he hasn't been able to break into that box yet.
I've always believed luck to be a function of intent --
In this case, mine.
When these dark clouds were gathering,
I took measures to keep Agent Keen safe
to ride out the storm.
Are you ready to do your part now?
I won't let him have her.
I'll take that as a yes.
The best way you can help is by continuing to guard Elizabeth.
And when the time comes, make sure Karakurt
reaches the F.B.I. safely.
Karakurt. The Russian?
What does he have to do with this?
He's agreed to confess his sins to the U.S. government,
including the ones he committed on behalf of the Cabal
to frame Agent Keen.
Cooper and Tom Keen are holding Karakurt
in a cabin near Lake Yvonne.
I can have him in the city within the hour.
Cooper and Tom?
He tried to tell you, Donald. You didn't listen.
Apparently, you have a disregard for Tom Keen
that exceeds even my own.
I have to meet someone.
Remember, guard Elizabeth
and keep Karakurt alive.
Donald.
I find him so stiff so much of the time.
He doesn't appreciate life's trimmings.
Take yourself, for example.
It's my understand he fired you for helping Elizabeth
come to my rescue.
He had every right.
I went behind his back.
I'm willing to take responsibility for my actions.
Watch out. That's the kind of spirit that could save America.
Thank you for meeting me, Samar.
What do you want?
We're going to clear Elizabeth's name.
It'll involve a sizable drug haul,
an F.B.I. heist in the U.S. Treasury Department.
But first, I need to make an appointment.
An appointment with whom?
With the Foreign Minister of Venezuela.
How long is this gonna take?
I'd say about 20 seconds and we should be there.
Okay. Good.
I'm -- I'm going to have to call you back.
Where's Reven Wright?
That's what I'm trying to find out.
This is not like her.
I'm...I'm worried something's happened.
Wanna know what I think?
I think the director has something to do with this, because --
You are talking about the director
of the national clandestine services here.
You threw him out of here once.
You gotta do it again before it's too late.
If he has intelligence, I can't just overrule him.
Look, Reven said I could trust you.
And without her here, it's --
I need your help.
Do you remember Karakurt?
The Russian assassin.
Harold Cooper's holding him at a cabin near Lake Yvonne.
He's willing to talk, and when he does,
it'll clear Keen of all terrorist charges.
But if the director gets --
I've already asked my sources to confirm the director's intel.
If we can show that there's no credible threat,
I'll make sure he backs down.
As for Reven Wright,
last time we talked, she mentioned an associate.
Um, what was his name?
Tommy Markin.
Maybe he has something to do with her disappearance.
Does that name mean anything to you?
Tommy Markin.
No.
Never heard of him.
Reven Wright's not coming back.
How do you know?
Tommy Markin.
Was a guy I told Reven about, only Reven,
and Hitchin just asked about him.
Laurel Hitchin is in the Cabal.
And I just told her where to find
the only person who can save Keen.
She just told the Director.
Okay, okay. Uh, glass half-full.
There's someone who can save Agent Keen?
Karakurt.
Cooper's hiding him at a cabin near Lake Yvonne.
He's not answering.
I gotta get him to move Karakurt
before the Director's goons get there.
Go. She'll be fine.
You know better than anyone, they can't break in there.
What if they figure out the code?
They won't.
How do you know?
I'm the one who changed it.
U.S. Marshals are gonna be here in three hours.
If I'm not back, you let Keen out for them,
only them.
OK.
Rafael!
Reddington, what are you doing here?
Rafael.
It's time to meet with your boss.
I need to meet with him today.
I can't. It's not possible.
This is for you. Happy birthday.
My birthday was in August.
My goodness.
Well, time flies when you're on the run.
Please, let's get out of the open.
There's nothing I can do for you.
The Foreign Minister, he's traveling today.
You see that lovely woman there?
The one with the camera?
She's a stringer for U.P.I.
Dear, dear friend.
Shoots my Christmas card every year.
She has a wonderful eye for composition and detail.
An intuitive sense of timing to capture the moment.
A warm embrace between old friends.
The exchange of a gift.
The intimacy of a quiet conversation
in the backseat of a car.
But the curious thing is,
pictures never tell the whole story.
For instance, the only story here will be
your friendly meeting with an international criminal
wanted by the F.B.I., Interpol.
I wonder how long you'll survive
once that story hits the Venezuelan press?
I'm sorry. I can't help myself.
It's a photo album for your press clippings.
Rafael.
The meeting with the Foreign Minister will happen today.
Is it set?
The Foreign Minister will be making a fuel stop
at Kirby Heliport at 3:00 p.m. today.
I'll have 15 minutes with him.
What's our next move?
Rendezvous will be fruitless
unless we can retrieve a certain care package.
The F.B.I. took it into custody this morning.
That package is the ticket to Elizabeth's freedom.
What's in the package?
El Dorado.
The lost city of gold?
It was never a city.
When Spanish explorers reached South America,
they heard stories about a gold-dusted tribal chief
dumping vast piles of treasure into Lake Guatavita as an offering.
The Spaniards actually drained the lake.
Of course, all they found was a handful of trinkets.
So they killed all the natives,
and El Dorado came to represent
the fantasy of boundless wealth --
And that is what's inside the package.
I don't understand.
You will, once we steal it from the F.B.I.
I mean, how many times do I have to tell you?
It wasn't about sex.
If it wasn't about the sex, then why'd you have sex?
Why not invite him to join your book club?
Because I hate my book club.
And the only reason I joined that book club
is because you were never home.
Doug was just, you know, company.
With a series of regrettable mistakes along the way.
For God's sake, Harold, would you please answer that phone?
The cabin. Karakurt. You have to leave now.
‭What? How do you know‬ about Karakurt?
It doesn't matter.
The bottom line is the Cabal knows you're stashing Karakurt
in the cabin near Lake Yvonne.
Look, can they track it down?
Yes.
My neighbor owns the cabin.
They'll search our phone records.
Take Karakurt out now.
I'm not with him. Tom Keen is.
So call him.
I won't get through.
That's the whole point of the cabin.
It's remote. No cell phone coverage.
How far away are you?
Hour. Minimum.
All right, I'm closer.
Look, just text me the address.
I'm on my way now.
So when they determine the stress points on the box,
then what?
Not having much luck?
No, we'll find a way in.
He'll come for you.
Reddington? Yes, I expect he will,
now that his prima ballerina is trapped in a jewelry box.
Did you ever find out?
Find out what?
His connection to you.
It's always been curious to me.
Follows you around like a faithful bloodhound.
But you still don't know.
Well, that's too bad.
It's -- it's a very unsatisfying way to go out,
don't you think?
How much time do we have?
The F.B.I. in West Virginia would've taken the care package
into their custody this morning when they arrested Keen.
But there's no F.B.I. field office in West Virginia
to store evidence, so they would've sent a team
from their Pittsburgh field office to collect it.
They should be on the road back to Pittsburgh by now.
We need to intercept them
before they reach their field office.
The trick is to purloin the package
without them knowing we've taken it.
For that,
we need more stolen evidence.
You keep a storage locker in West Virginia?
I keep a storage locker filled with useful items in most states.
Two or three in the Red States.
Steaks?
Bistecca alla fiorentina,
sourced from a breed of cattle in southern Tuscany.
The ultimate expression of beef,
with a bowl of fagioli,
a '96, '97 Barolo.
These need another month to cure.
I never took you for a...
Drug dealer? Absolutely not.
Well, not really.
I've made a rather healthy investment in a consortium
that supplies medical marijuana to facilities in Colorado,
Oregon, Washington,
District of Columbia.
But simply as an effort to diversify
into more legitimate businesses.
As for consumption,
I must admit to a fondness for any well-appointed opium den,
and a bit of hashish goes well
with just about anything.
But stimulants, I have no taste for.
I prefer that slight curve at the small of the back,
the swell of a breast,
the soft nape of the neck to quicken my heartbeat.
Nonetheless, after a rather contentious
and messy negotiation in Cartagena,
this was all that was left on the table, so I took it.
Cocaine still remains a valid currency to some of my clients.
Especially in England. The wealthy Brits?
They are cocaine mad over there. Go figure.
Why don't you grab some kilos off the top
and let's go stage a crime scene?
This is fun.
Who had the pleasure?
That would be me.
Head on. 35 miles an hour.
Just like my uncle Vic on a Saturday night.
Sorry about the short notice, Morgan.
Chuck. Nice paint job.
Thanks. Careful. It's still wet.
Well, gang's all here. Let's get to work.
My name is Agent Morrison in the West Virginia office.
Yes, I called this in two hours ago.
I need someone here from evidence recovery ASAP.
That's right.
30 bags of cocaine, exit 129a off the I-64.
Can you get them here now, please?
I've been babysitting this evidence all day.
Thank you, guys.
Time to run.
As soon as you get the package,
bring it straight to Kirby Heliport.
The plan hinges on that package.
I'll be there.
Hey. You okay?
I've been better.
Okay, you're almost there.
In an hour, Ressler will move you to a holding cell
at the courthouse.
You'll be safe there.
I'm having trouble breathing.
Just the man I'm looking for.
One of my technicians figured out why the
code box does not work.
Apparently it was changed.
Coincidentally enough, just prior to our arrival.
That must be...
What?
A mistake?
Yes, probably.
But we can't prove it.
Technology being what it is and all.
And you are the tech guy.
Aram, I can't...
I can't breathe.
What's happening to her?
‭I'm sure I don't know.‬
Losing oxygen in there?
I'm sorry. We don't have the door code.
I'll have one of my men look into it right away.
That would be a tragedy.
She'd better be worth it.
Who's that?
The girl.
You know, the one who annulled your marriage.
I know about you two. I know you're risking your life
for someone who doesn't want anything to do with --
Hey, don't shoot.
Don't shoot. It's Donald Ressler.
All right, open it.
What are you doing here?
Cooper sent me.
Look, we gotta get him out of here.
Like hell we do.
The Director knows you have Karakurt.
The Cabal is coming.
No offense, but I'll wait for Cooper to tell me that.
Someone's out there!
The Cabal's not coming.
They're already here.
Okay, breathe slowly and steady.
It doesn't make any sense.
Even if they shut out the air,
I should be able to breathe in here for hours, right?
Nitrogen.
He's pumping nitrogen in through the vents.
It would -- oh, my God, it would strip the oxygen out
in minutes.
You wouldn't be able to smell it either.
What, are you guys just gonna watch this happen?
She can't breathe.
The director said he's working on the problem.
He is not, and you know that!
Do something. Do something!
Okay, right. Okay, Agent Keen. Okay, hang on.
I'm just -- I'm gonna see if I can access
the ventilation system from my terminal.
Okay? It's, um, it's gonna be okay.
I'll be right back.
How did the Director know that we had Karakurt?
How about we focus on the problem at hand?
We gotta put down these targets so that I can get back to Keen.
Where is she?
F.B.I. custody.
The Cabal is trying to get at her.
You're just a one-man justice league, aren't you?
You know you're gonna get us all killed before this is over.
Get me out of here!
Keen!
Clear!
You okay?
I'm not!‬
Least you could give me a weapon so I can defend myself.
Not if it's aimed at our backs, no way.
I can't access the air system,
but I'm trying to override it with a rombertik.
It's gonna take a little bit of time, Liz.
Oh, my God. Liz, I have to let you out.
Please!
Damn it, are you even listening? I --
I'll go to the press.
I don't care!
There are witnesses here.
I will tell the world
what you're doing here.
Fix the air!
I don't know about this, Peter.
It'll go down as an equipment malfunction.
And there is no one to trace it to.
Yeah? And what if he opens the door?
Well, we return to the original plan.
We take Elizabeth Keen to an undisclosed location
for questioning, from which she will try to escape.
And then... we'll be forced to shoot her.
In any case, you are looking at a ghost.
Do you have any idea how long I've been standing out here?
Hey, tell it to dispatch. We were halfway to Pittsburgh
before we got the call to come all the way back.
Okay, let's just load up.
You know we can't let you handle the evidence.
And I'd advise you to check your watch
because I've been out in the sun on my feet all day
without a bite to eat since 6:00 a.m.
We offered her a doughnut.
Hey, I've been meaning to ask one of you federal boys.
What does it take to be a g-man?
See, I got this lazy eye. It's got a mind of its own.
You suppose that would be an issue?
No offense, but we're short on time ourselves today.
Here.
Are we good?
What?‬
Hey. I need your assurance that nothing in that van
is going to go missing. Are we good?
Yeah. Relax.
It's as safe as can be.
Let's go!
Take the left!
Ah, this isn't gonna be pretty.
I'm the one who tipped off the Cabal about this hunting cabin.
Are you kidding me? Why would you do that?
Trusted the wrong person.
I mean, yes, you were just doing what you thought was right.
Even if you were dead wrong.
My father was a cop.
He died because he wouldn't go on the take.
Was set up by his own partner, Tommy Markin.
You know, I spent all these years
wanting to believe that he died for the right thing.
I'm not so sure now.
Principles are a bitch, man.
I avoid them at all cost.
I just hope your old man taught you how to shoot.
Hang on, Liz. Come on, you have to.
Come on, a little longer.
Come on. Liz?
I, uh, I'm afraid we're out of options.
Can't seem to figure out what's wrong with this air system.
Liz.
Liz?
Liz? Wake up!
Liz!
Navabi.
What's that, son?
The pass code -- it is "Navabi."
It's "Navabi"! Open the door.
N-A-V-A-B-I.
Open the door. Open the door! Do it!
Open the door. Come on.
Come on. Open it!
Come on. Okay. Come on, Liz. Come on, Liz.
Yeah, yeah.
You're okay.
Liz. I'm -- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. So sorry.
Gracias.
Mr. Foreign Minister,
thank you for altering your itinerary to meet me.
And how is El Presidente?
He has irritable bowels.
But what can you expect?
We just borrowed another $5 billion from China.
So, what is this about, Reddington?
I was told a matter of national interest.
Indeed.
I believe I can help your president's stomach condition.
Oh, you're gonna erase my country's debt?
No, but I can give you some walking-around money. Please.
Gentlemen!
We can preserve the quiet tranquility of these woods
if you just send Karakurt out now.
You have 30 seconds before we begin shooting.
There's no way we're sending him out.
Agreed.
Then how 'bout giving me a weapon?
It's not like I can run.
Come on, give him a gun.
15 seconds!
The Cabal, the ones coming for Liz...
They're not gonna get her.
Let's just get it over with.
♬Once when you were young♬
♬Pedaling through the sun♬
♬The light streamed through your body like a glass♬
♬But then the changes come♬
♬Things are good undone♬
♬And the things you lose, they don't come back again♬
♬So you want to go back again♬
Check for survivors.
Knees!
I'll just, uh, take that.
Let's get out of here.
I won't let you take her.
Aram, put the gun down!
They'll shoot you without thinking twice.
I don't care.
I do.
You've done enough.
No, I didn't.
I opened the door.
Agent Mojtabal, stand down.
Aram. Aram, look at me. Look at me.
I don't blame you for letting me out.
I don't.
Now please put the gun down.
Let's go.
Excuse me!
Where exactly do you think you're taking this young lady?
Mrs. Panabaker, right on time.
I believe punctuality is a virtue,
as is following orders.
My orders are to make sure Elizabeth Keen
is transported safely
to the E. Barrett Prettyman courthouse.
And I have actionable intel that requires us
to move Agent Keen to Fort Mcnair.
I am aware of the intel.
So is D.N.I., who's reviewed it
and upheld the original agreement.
As National Security Advisor, this is my call to make.
Not according to this.
Oh, don't take my word for it.
Get the director of National Intelligence on the line.
Oh, well, then I guess I'll call him myself.
Why would Venezuela ever agree to such a ridiculous proposal?
Why, to stick it to the United States, of course.
They've been trying to topple your regime for years.
If we do as you suggest,
the United States would just impose more sanctions.
Our shelves are already bare.
This would hurt my people and my economy
for generations to come.
This meeting is over.
Diaz, I told you I could put money back
in Venezuela's Central Bank.
And I've told you,
you couldn't possibly give us enough money
to make what you're asking worth the risk.
Do you know the story of El Dorado?
Thank you, my dear.
Those are chromium-plated
master-printing plates for the $100 bill,
created using the U.S. Treasury Department's
own software upgrades plate design,
encoding techniques --
Where did you get these?
There was this plane that fell out of the sky,
a group of anti-capitalists.
Terrorists in funny masks. But I digress.
The point is I'm giving El Jefe
the ability to print as much money as he'd like to print.
You son of a gun.
I've been called worse.
Found a ride.
Your weapons on the ground.
Or I'll kill him.
He'll kill me anyway, so just drop him.
Just drop the son of a bitch.
Come on, man, you're F.B.I. You never put your weapon down.
Just...Second he shoots me, drop him.
Drop him!
All right, you win. Okay?
Did you even go to the academy?
You should've listened to your friend.
I figured you two could use some backup.
Good morning.
Agent Ressler, listen to me.
Put the gun down.
You should leave.
Stop.
Do you know the damage you've done?
That your organization has done to this country, to my friends?
I don't care about your friends, and I hate this country.
Well, "Hate" is a strong word.
I like the part where I make bail
and catch the next plane to France.
You're not gonna live to see the inside of a courtroom.
Sure, I am.
And not just any courtroom, but a courtroom of my choosing,
with the judge of my choosing.
God bless America.
Agent Ressler.
You're not gonna do this.
You deserve to die.
Put down the gun.
I know he does, but not by your hand.
Since when did you grow a conscience?
I don't know. Since I've been hanging out with you.
I'm not happy about it either.
Ah, he's right. We bring him in, he walks.
He doesn't pay for any of this.
Your dad.
You wanna know if he died for nothing.
Whether he did or didn't
depends on whether you pull that trigger.
Matias Solomon, you're under arrest...
for the attempted murder of a federal agent,
for the attempted murder of a material witness
in a federal investigation, treason, espionage...
conspiracy to -- you know what?
Why don't I get you a Penal Code?
It would be easier to figure out what you haven't done.
Yes, sir.
I understand.
I stand corrected.
I have never seen two people so disappointed
that the country isn't under attack.
Yeah, well, I'm not convinced.
So let's get Agent Keen transferred, shall we?
My men are on site.
And they will stay on site.
I consulted with Reven Wright before I drafted the order.
Keen isn't going anywhere without one agent,
Donald Ressler present, to oversee her transfer.
Uh, Agent Ressler isn't here.
Sorry I'm late.
Bring him to holding.
Elizabeth Keen, I'm here to escort you downtown,
where you'll be held safely pending your arraignment.
It's about time.
I know what you did.
I know you killed Reven Wright.
This isn't over.
And you.
I want you gone when I get back.
Thank you.
I need to come around here more often.

Come closer, Aram.
There's nobody down there.
Not at the moment.
So then...
why did you ask me to meet you at an empty grave?
There are...
foundational elements in our lives.
People...
that form the brick and mortar of who we are.
People that are so deeply imbedded
that we take their existence for granted
until suddenly, they're not there.
And we...
collapse into rubble.
I've stood over the open grave of someone I've loved...
too often.
Once for my mother.
And then... the others.
I needed to recall this feeling because...
I'd be staring at another body right now
if not for you, Aram.
It wasn't weakness that prevented you
from watching your friend die today.
It was hope,
and thank heavens you were in a hopeful mood.
You saved Elizabeth.
I'm forever in your debt.
Now gather your team.
It's time to take down the Cabal.
