A vampire killed my parents.
Maybe that was you.
It was all me.
I'm bad, Elena, I am bad for you,
And I'm choosing to let you go.
You think I'm gonna judge you
after I find out that you've been tortured for 5 years?
Stop defending me!
Do you know the reason we're together?
It's because Klaus granted us permission to be together.
I can't live like that.
You take one more step, we are done.
I'm dying of old age.
Good-bye.
You're Katherine Pierce.
Suck it up.
I may have an idea that will keep you alive longer.
You have the ability to keep living inside someone else's body.
Katherine?
Katherine?
Clear!
Give me 200 joules.
Charged.
Clear!
It doesn't make sense.
I was just speaking with her.
She sounded fine.
Doctors think it was a, um, heart attack.
Trust me. Katherine Pierce is not going to die from a heart attack.
Clear!
We both know my mother.
She will fight this.
She's dying.
Every single organ in her body is failing.
Vampire blood can't save her.
I compelled the doctors to let me take her home
so she's more comfortable,
but she's dying.
They don't think she'll survive the rest of the day.
What the hell?
Ok. Time to wake up, sleepyhead.
No! I'm not leaving this bed.
Which is why we brought breakfast to you.
What's all this?
This is your breakup breakfast!
My what?
Damon dumped Elena.
Why?
I have no idea.
Who spends two years pining after a girl to dump her?
I can hear you, dumbass.
So that's it? You're just giving up?
As she should!
I mean, he did say-- and I quote--
"I am a bad person. I am bad for you,
and I am choosing to let you go."
You memorized my breakup?
Of course I did.
Drink this.
So you sure it was just a fight?
I just have to face reality.
If Damon makes up his mind about something,
it's done.
Yeah.
It's Stefan.
Tell him I don't feel like talking.
She doesn't feel like talking.
She doesn't feel like talking.
Well, she's gonna want to talk about this.
Rule number one, think of the worst thing
Katherine Pierce has ever done to you.
Rule number two, toast to the glory of her impending death.
Rule number 3, if you come across something
that's worse-- which you will--
repeat rules one and two.
She pretended to be buried in a tomb for 145 years
while I waited for her lying ass.
Wait. Does that beat pretending to be Elena
and kissing me on the front porch of your old house?
I don't think so.
I don't think so either. Damn.
Quarterback, go.
Think on that. Little Gilbert.
She fed to my Silas, and I died.
Doozy.
Then she made me crash my car into a pole
and left me for dead again.
Double doozy. Drink.
My sister's dead because of her.
Yes, she is
because I wouldn't have even been in town
to turn Vicki into a murderous vampire
if I wasn't trying to get Katherine out of a tomb
she wasn't in.
Group shot.
Seriously?
Elena, we were just, uh--
I know what you're doing.
You're cut off.
If anyone is drinking to Katherine's last days,
it's gonna be me.
She impersonated me repeatedly...
Made aunt Jenna stab herself in the stomach
and cut off uncle John's fingers.
He might have deserved that.
My grams died trying to close a tomb she wasn't in.
Tyler's werewolf curse got triggered because of her.
Klaus followed her to Mystic Falls,
and because of that, we lost Jenna.
And Alaric.
We're gonna need more booze.
She tried to kill me at least twice.
She did kill me,
although I'm weirdly better off.
They're talking about me, aren't they?
They're reminiscing.
It's fine.
I'm sure I deserve everything that they're saying.
Does my hand look wrinkled to you?
It looks fine.
If I start to sag anywhere,
you take a knife and you jam it
into my carotid artery immediately, ok?
Ok.
What?
You know, even on your death bed,
you're vain.
Hey. If a girl's got to go,
it may as well be glamorous, right?
That's definitely an age spot.
This is not an age spot, Katherine.
You're being too nice to me.
Why?
You're dying.
I think I can muster up a little bit of compassion.
Nadia.
Rumor has it she burnt down the entire city of Atlanta once.
That might win.
All right. Knock it off
Or take it somewhere else.
You guys are being insensitive.
Come on, Stefan.
Don't let the sight of a frail, human, Elena look-alike
cloud your memories of the manipulative psycho that she is.
In 1864, Katherine moved into my home,
she compelled me to love her,
seduced my brother, fed us full of vampire blood,
and then started a war with the town that got us killed.
Exactly. Bottoms up.
But centuries before that, she was just an innocent girl
who was shunned by her family,
so for 500 years, she lied and manipulated
and did whatever she had to do survive, and she did.
She's a survivor, right?
So that's the girl that I will drink to today. Cheers.
Please. One night of hot sex with her,
and you're brainwashed?
What?!
What?!
Oh, my--I forgot to tell you.
You were kidnapped and hostaged and--
Bottle's empty actually.
That's why you never send a busboy to do a man's job.
Nadia, the devil's spawn.
Hey, Caroline. Did you remember to tell Elena that?
I think my mind just exploded.
Ok. Katherine's upstairs.
Actually, I'm here to see all of you.
I found a way to save my mother,
And I need some help.
No way.
Even my biased brother knows
I will kick his ass from here to Kentucky
if he helps Katherine Pierce
live one more day on this earth.
No volunteers.
I figured as much,
which is why I found that old safe
your brother spent his summer drowning in
and buried it on this property
with your friend Matt inside of it.
Oh. Without this.
What?!
I figured you two would be my volunteers.
Congratulations on your intuition.
We're here. We volunteered.
Now tell us where Matt is.
Matt will be freed once you help me get what I need.
Which is what exactly?
I need a traveler.
Katherine was born into a traveler bloodline.
She can make herself be a passenger in someone else's body
if a traveler teaches her how to do it.
Like your boyfriend Gregor hopped a ride in Matt's body
until Katherine killed him of course.
Your mother killed your boyfriend.
Why are we saving her again?
Gregor was gonna kill her, and she was protecting herself.
Oh, please don't defend her,
Especially now that you've- -
Now that I've slept with her.
I'm sure you have plenty to say about that.
We're here.
So we're just supposed to help you
let Katherine take over someone's life?
Not just anyone's life.
Mine.
I'm going to make her a passenger in my body.
I don't see any freshly dug ground.
This property it massive.
Hello! Is no one gonna comment on the fact
that Stefan slept with Katherine?
I mean, that's kind of a big deal.
Does it matter? We've all slept with our fair share of bad choices.
No offense taken.
No. Obviously not you.
Bonnie Bennett!
Wait. Did you two?
And you didn't tell me?
I didn't think I was obligated.
Of course you were obligated.
You're my best friend.
Oh, my God! Does Elena know that her little brother- -
No!
Aw! Scandalous sex! Even better!
God, how am I the only person
on the planet who's not having scandalous sex?
Why don't we split up and think about that?
Good idea. We'll cover more ground that way.
No, no! No, mama. No!
What a mess.
Damon?
Ok. I'll say it. I miss Klaus.
I mean, the way this guy used to torture you.
Sword in the daddy. Nice touch.
Get out of my head.
Remind me how this slaughter went down again.
Oh, right. Klaus was gonna kill you in a blood sacrifice,
and you, being you, ran for the hills,
only to come back and find your entire family
had been massacred.
So if I'm adding this up right,
your family's entire death was all your fault.
No! No! No! No!
Put the pillow down, Damon.
Liz.
If you kill her, it's murder.
I mean, I'd have to bring you in, lock you up.
There's all that paperwork.
Every awful thing I've ever done is linked to her.
She taught me how to kill,
how to enjoy it.
She ruined me,
and I can't take any of that back.
Look at how much control she still has over you.
Prove her wrong.
Matt!
Matt, we're coming for you!
Hello, Caroline.
Klaus.
Not exactly the Ritz.
Travelers don't have much.
They're always on the move,
but on the plus side, sometimes their services can be bought.
I found one who named the right price.
You brought them.
Yes, Mia.
Are you ready to make the deal?
What's going on?
I have the feeling the right price for the deal was us.
I'm sorry, but they asked for doppelgangers.
No idea why.
Our rings. They're messing with them.
We can't go outside.
Sorry. Matt's buried alive. No time to chat.
You're not even the least bit curious as to why I'm here?
I literally just whooshed at the sight of your face,
so no.
Damon informed me that Katerina Petrova
has taken a tragic turn.
So you're here to gloat over her corpse to be,
to delight in the closure of 500 years of revenge!
Great! Now I'm even less interested.
Well, then perhaps you'd be more interested in talking about Tyler.
Is he- - did you- -
No. I sent him off with little more than a bruised ego.
He really does hate me, poor lad.
Revenge, it eats at him.
I hear you two broke up.
Because I made him choose- -
Me or his stupid revenge fantasy,
and he chose wrong.
I suggest that you learn from his mistakes
and let Katherine die in peace.
Dying sucks enough as it is.
No need to rub anyone's nose in it.
Ok. Here's the sedatives from the hospital.
Should help with the pain.
I don't want them.
They make me weak,
and when I'm weak, he can get in my head.
Ok. Suit yourself.
They're right here if you want them.
Stillooking for Matt?
Any word from Elena?
We're not on a speaking basis.
Didn't you hear, sheriff?
He was so afraid to dirty her...
white dove feathers that he let her little wings fly free,
and it was all my fault.
That'll shut her up for a while.
How much further until we reach this Lockwood plantation?
Won't be long now.
We've just entered the town of Mystic Falls.
Good.
What is it now?
Looks like a gentleman's having some problems with his carriage.
At this rate, we won't arrive until sundown.
What does it matter if- -
Who is that? He's so handsome.
What do you say, Emily?
Think that gentleman's family
would take in a poor orphan girl from Atlanta?
What the hell was that?
You never heard the real story
of how I came to meet your brother?
I want to think that this prophecy
of the universe bringing the doppelgangers together
is absurd,
but the moment that I saw Stefan- -
I can't describe it- -
The out- of- the- way road, the downed tree,
the broken- down carriage,
it just- - it sounds like fate to me.
This isn't awkward.
Guess we probably picked the wrong day to be in a fight, huh?
I'm sorry, ok?
It's not my place to judge,
especially after everything that you've been through.
You don't happen to speak Czech, do you?
No.
Ok. Stefan?
It's ok.
I guess he wants doppelganger blood.
Should we knock his head off?
Depends. If I kill him, do the rest of these boards fall down?
Right. Blood it is.
Why aren't we healing?
Matt!
Matt!
Would you give me the same choice?
What?
Were I to abandon my revenge against Katerina,
would you offer me the same choice as Tyler?
I don't know what you mean.
Yes, you do.
You- - you can't do this to me.
You can't just show up and distract me
while my friend is in danger.
You know, while you've been vamping off in all the wrong directions,
I heard Matt's distant and desperate screams.
Where?
Don't worry, luv. I've got it covered.
Trust me. He'll be quite happy with his rescuer.
I'm gone not 3 months,
and look at the trouble you're in.
Just go away.
Don't you think that you've made your point?
What point?
Like this one?
Jenna?
Remember when you compelled me to stab myself?
No, no. No, no, no! Unh!
Poor aunt Jenna.
I had to compel her to think that she walked into that knife.
She was so confused.
No. No. No more drugs!
Hello, fingers.
Good- bye, fingers.
Enough!
Elijah.
Katerina.
You're here.
I'm so sorry. Did you think that that was real?
Nope. No one's coming to say good- bye, Katherine,
Because no one cares.
I do.
Come on.
Let's get on with this.
Guess it's a good thing I'm not claustrophobic anymore.
That's what Katherine helped you with- -
Silas aftermath.
She did.
Can I just hate her anyway?
You can.
Thank you.
But I don't.
I know I should, but for some reason,
I keep rooting for her to find peace.
Katherine's not the only one, you know?
Damon keeps pushing you away
because he hates himself,
who he is, what he's done.
Just remember that you never gave up on me,
so don't give up on him.
Don't let him give up uon you eithre?
So that's it? All you needed from us was a bucket of blood?
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
Repeat the spell so I know you understand how the passenger works.
I can't.
Just say it.
Jaryakat a zem. Daryeet acza.
Say it, and it's done.
Your spirit goes inside my body,
Mia will activate you by calling you forth,
and you get to live.
Can I have a moment with my daughter, please?
I know what you're going to say- -
We don't have time for this.
Nadia...
Letting my father rip you out of my arms,
it was the biggest regret of my life.
I should have fought harder to keep you,
but I didn't.
So I spent the next 500 years
making sure that I never made that mistake again.
I fought for everything,
and in the process,
I had a long, full life,
and I got to know my beautiful daughter.
And you spent the last centuries
searching for me.
Don't waste another minute on me.
It's your turn to live.
I can't do this.
Let me.
I've made selfish decisions all my life.
Let me do the right thing for once.
Fine. Then go. Leave me.
Drift off into oblivion,
but I will not sit by your side
and watch you die.
So the quarterback has been saved.
What now?
Don't you have a dying girl to go punish for all of her sins?
I do, but I won't for you.
So you came all the way to Mystic Falls
just to back off when I ask you to?
No. I came all the way to Mystic Falls to gloat
over a corpse to be, as you so poetically put it,
but I will leave minus the gloating
in return for one small thing.
And what is that?
I want your confession.
My confession?
I didn't do anything.
Confession about what?
Me.
As soon as we're done here,
I'm gonna walk away,
and I'm never coming back.
You'll never again have to look me in the eye
and cover our connection with hostility and revulsion.
You'll never have to loathe the darkestection parts of yourself
that care for me in spite of all I've done.
I will be gone,
and you will be free.
I just...
want you to be honest with me.
I'm in college.
I'm building a life for myself.
I have plans and a future and things that I want,
and none of those things involve you, ok.
None of them.
I see.
No, you don't, because...
Yes, I cover our connection with hostility
because, yes, I hate myself for the truth,
so if you promise
to walk away like you said and never come back.
Then, yes, I will be honest with you.
I will be honest with you about what I want.
I will walk away,
and I'll never come back, I promise.
Good.
What the hell happened to you?
In a shocking twist.
Katherine's daughter's a psychopath.
She's all yours.
I've had fun messing with her mind all day.
Damon.
I know, Stefan, I know.
It's been a rough couple days.
I needed an outlet, ok?
These drugs are... hardcore.
Close your eyes.
I came to say bye.
I want to see you.
You will.
So this is the memory you came back to?
A little dark, no?
Damon already had his fun with this one.
This was the worst day of my life.
He said it was my fault,
that I deserved everything bad
that's ever happened to me.
He's right.
He was right, Stefan.
I don't deserve to be loved.
Open your mind to me.
Look at your father.
He's gone.
What are you doing?
You deserve to feel peace.
Mother!
You were a 17-year-old girl.
Katherine...
None of this is your fault.
Good-bye, Katherine.
Is she...
Not yet.
With these drugs,
she won't wake up again.
You know, I was in a dark place, Damon.
And Katherine pulled you out of it.
Irony abounds.
You know, whatever is going on with you and Elena,
you need to fix it.
She's the best thing that ever happened to you.
What, don't you think I know that?
I can't live without her...
But when you think about it,
I'm no better than Katherine.
Elena will be happier without me.
What, I'm being selfless?
Don't give me that look.
I'm not giving you a look.
Katherine fricking Pierce has a selfless moment,
I'm not allowed to?
Fine. Fine.
When I get Elena back
and the whole universe freaks out
because the fated doppelgangers are torn apart,
just remember you-- you're the one
that pep talked me out of doing the right thing
for the universe and all mankind.
I will keep that in mind.
You do that.
Hey. Where have you been?
In the woods. I got lost.
So what are we doing?
We are waiting for Katherine to bite it.
So this anchor thing,
does it mean that you'll, like,
be able to feel Katherine's death or whatever?
I think so. I mean, she's human,
but she's also a doppelganger
and traveler apparently.
So who else do you see over there?
Anybody I know?
I see lots of people.
My grams, the other witches.
Vicki.
I just don't talk about it, you know, just--
Because it's depressing as hell.
Tell Matty I love him.
What's happening?
She's here.
She said she loves you.
Tell him that I watch over him
and no more knocking around with that blond original chick
who almost got him killed.
Wait. Wait. What's happening? What am I missing?
Me.
Tyler?
Rebekah says to tell you
I'm her parting gift.
Hey, Care.
We've really gone through 4 bottles of bourbon today?
Can someone tell these idiots to lay off the booze?
Oh, my god.
Alaric?
Ric's here?
Where the hell have you been?
I thought you bailed on us
to go find peace or something.
Do you honestly think I'd leave Damon in charge
and never look back?
He's talking about me, isn't he?
He says you're a dick.
Cheers, buddy.
Cheers.
Katherine.
Ding-dong. Does that mean the witch is dead?
No.
It's too soon. I can't!
Wow. You really don't want to die, do you?
I swear I just heard your heart stop.
Where am I?
Still alive... Sadly.
I thought I was a goner there for a second,
But I still have unfinished business.
So do I.
I had this whole speech
that I was preparing to give your unconscious body.
Let me guess.
Hate, loathe, screw you,
die, bitch, et cetera.
Yes.
Plus one more thing.
I forgive you.
You what?
I forgive you.
You weren't born evil.
Your life made you that way.
You lost everyone that you cared about way too young,
and you didn't have a family that looked after you.
Sound familiar?
Is this the...
"we're not so different you and I"
Doppelganger speech?
Because I'd be happy to skip it.
I'll save it for the funeral that we probably won't have for you.
Perfect.
I just wanted to get the forgiveness part out.
It's part of me that I...
I never want to lose.
Good for you.
Now maybe you can help a girl out
and give me one more syringe,
and if anyone's gonna plunge a needle in me one last time,
may as well be you.
Symmetry and all that.
Elena...
Thank you for your forgiveness.
You're welcome.
Jaryakat a zem. Daryeet acza.
Hello.
Vyjt.
Hello? Are you there?
I'm here.
Talk to me. Did it work?
Of course it worked.
I'm Katherine Pierce.
I survive.
I'll see you soon.
Hi. I'm Elena Gilbert.
