Did everything go okay with the annulment?
No problems. It's all taken care of.Ross,thank you.
Do you want to go see a movie?Yeah,why not?
I'll get my sweater.
Do you want to hear something weird? Always.
I didn't get the annulment.
What?We're still married.
Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Do you have any gum?
Wait! Wait! Ross,can I just talk to you for just a second?
We'll be late for the movie.
There's a cab. Taxi!
That's great.My God,huh? There you go.
We're gonna walk. It's right at the Angelika.
The Angelika! Go! Go!
You didn't get the annulment?!I know.
-Ross？-I tried,but when I got to my lawyer's office,all I heard was:
"Three divorces! Three divorces!"
Yes,in that high voice.
I just don't want my tombstone to read: "Ross Geller: Three Divorces."
Don't worry about that. Your tombstone can say whatever you want.
It can say,"Ross Geller: Good at Marriage."
You know? Mine's gonna say,"Phoebe Buffay: Buried Alive."
All I know is,I can't have another failed marriage.
So you're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?
Woman. Sorry.
Okay,so I don't have it all worked out quite yet.Just don't say anything to Rachel.
Rachel is one of my closest friends.
But being the only one that knows about this makes me feel special. Okay.
Okay,stop,stop!
 Phoebe?Hey,Rach!
What was that?Sorry. Mix-up.
How was the movie?I haven't seen it yet.
You'd better hurry. The Angelika! Go!
No
The One Where Ross Hugs Rachel
When I move in,can I get a gumball machine?
Of course. Joey wouldn't let you have one?
No,when it comes to sweets,he's surprisingly strict.
Did you tell him you're moving out?No,I keep trying.
And I can get out,"Joey,I have to.."
Then I lose my nerve and I finish with,"go to the bathroom."
He may think I'm sick.
I have to tell Rachel,but....
We just gotta get it over with.
Next time we see them,we'll just tell them.
That's it.
That's how it'll work now? You'll just order me around?
-Pretty much. -All right.
Monica
Hey,man,you feeling better?
We have something to tell you.
Oh,my God!You're pregnant!
No!
No？No！
Look,Joe,here's the thing.
Monica and I have decided to live together,here.I'm gonna be moving out,man.
I'm really happy for you guys. Congratulations. See you later.
Are you okay?
I gotta go. I've got an acting job.
Like you'd believe that.
This sucks!
I'll be across the hall. And I promise you...
the minute Monica and I break up,I'm moving right back in.
Maybe that's now.
If you're gonna move in with him...I feel it is my responsibility to tell you the truth about him.
He's a terrible roommate. Terrible.
He forgets to....He always,he always....
Who am I kidding? He's the best roommate!
-Hey,Phoebe. -Hey.
Oh,look,here's an article about people who marry people and don't tell them.
-Really? -Yeah,I'm reading Ross Geller Magazine.
Have you seen Rachel?
-No,why? -I have some exciting news.
You're pregnant.
No!Chandler and I are moving in together.Oh,that's good!
But if you were pregnant,what would you name it? Hint,Phoebe.
What's up?
Chandler and I are moving in together.
Oh,my God.Oh,my little sister and my best friend...shacking up.
That's great. That's great.
Guys,I'm happy too.Okay,come here.
Big day,huh? People moving in. People getting annulled.
I gotta go find Rachel.
If you see her,give her some really bad news,so mine doesn't seem so bad.
Something bad to tell Rachel.
Bad news for Rachel. What could that be?
Can you just lay off,please?
My life is an embarrassment. I should just go live under somebody's stairs.
It's not that big a deal.
You'll have been divorced three times.You'll have a life,you'll date..
No,I won't. I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now.
The only guys below me will be Four-Divorce Guy...Murderer Guy
and geologists.
Ross,you're being ridiculous. You are cute and smart and sweet.
That is much more important than three stupid divorces.
Have you dated anyone who's been divorced three times?
That's not fair. Most guys that have been divorced three times are 60.
You're young.
That's true,I am young.
Well....
Nobody cares about this except you.This embarrassment thing is all in your head.
-Here,I'll show you.
Come here. -What?
Hi. My friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time.But wouldn't you date him?
And if you wait right here,I'll go get Ross.
I thought you were Rachel.What gave me away?
I gotta tell her.
I told Ross and Phoebe. She's the only one left.
It's official. We're moving in together.No turning back.
Are you scared? Are you?!
I'm not.
That was my scariest voice. You're brave.
The worst day.
You're finally making progress at work,then your boss calls you Racquel.
Listen,for the first four years of my work,everybody called me Sha-la-lap
-Seriously. -I believe you.
It was in the middle of a meeting,so no one wants to correct her.
So everyone's calling me Racquel.
By the end of the day,the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky.
Well,I still think you're very,very nice and very pretty.
What?
All yours,babe.
Have a seat.
Listen to me,Chandler and I...are going to live together…Here.
Oh,my God.That's so great!
I'm so happy for you guys!
Really?
And that was so sweet of you to ask me.
The three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
Yes,we are.
Chandler,you'll have to watch those long showers you take...because you know Racquel can't be late.
He'll work on that.
This is so exciting!
Come and knock on our door
We'll be waiting for you
Once you know the stories,it's not that bad.
My first marriage: my wife's hidden her sexuality. It's not my fault.
My second marriage: I said the wrong name at the altar. It's a little my fault.
My third marriage:
They shouldn't let you get married...when you're drunk and have writing on your face. It's Nevada's fault.
So what do you think? Who wouldn't want to date him?
The divorces don't bother me. I'd date him.But not while he's still married.
And you,wouldn't you want to date?
I'm not dating at all anymore.
I was only dating guys that were bad for me.
So I decided that..Good. Good. Whatever.
And you,Meg?
Well,I don't care about the divorces,either.But I wouldn't date him.
Normally,he doesn't sweat this much.
It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.What?
She said,"He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."
This is crazy. I mean,yes,Rachel is my good friend.
And I have loved her in the past...but now,she is just my wife.
Phoebe,will you help me out here?
Well,I thought you loved her when you married her.
We were drunk! I would've married Joey with that amount of alcohol.
You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!
I'm sorry,but you guys are wrong.I just don't want to be divorced three times.
Now he's using this three-divorces reason...because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her.
I must say,well done. Bravo,Meg.
Fine. If this is what you think,forget about...the whole three-divorce thing.
I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled.
She means nothing to me.Nothing!
Okay,now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
I am so attracted to him right now.
When will we tell Rachel what actually will happen?
Soon.I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got.
I couldn't do it. She's my best friend.
Joey's my best friend.
I'm not your best friend?
You just said..
Of course you're my best friend.
Would you tell Rachel?
All right. At least I'm prepared.
Oh,yes.
-They're not for you. Are you upset? -I am now.
Hey,roomie.Okay,bye.
There's something important I have to tell you.
Are you pregnant?
No,but I'm throwing this shirt away.
I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
When I said that Chandler and I wanted to live together...
we meant alone together.
Oh,my God. That's funny. I can't believe I did that.
No,sweetie. You know what? This is my fault.I wasn't clear.I'm really sorry.
Listen,you take as much time as you need to move out,okay?There's absolutely no rush.
Okay.
Okay
Don't you want a cookie?
Sure.
Thanks.Do you need a tissue?
-Where did you get these? -I made them.
Oh,My God,they're so yummy!
-Okay,whose is this? -That's mine.
-And what about this? Whose is this? -That's mine.
Okay,whose dishwashing soap is this?
That was here when we moved in.
Oh,I guess it really is concentrated.
It's gonna be weird when I come home and you're not here.
No more Joey and Chan's.No more J and C's.
Do you want to go to Joey and Chandler's? I can't. It's not there.
I'll be across the hall. We can still do all the same stuff.
We won't be able to have those long talks at night...about our feelings and the future.
Not once did we do that.
Don't you remember that night,it was late and I was feeling sick...
and you said I would feel better tomorrow?
Oh,yeah. I remember that.
I don't know. I'm just gonna miss living with you.Yeah,me too,man.
-What the hell is that? -That's disgusting.
I told Rachel that it's just gonna be the two of us.Oh,yeah? Well,how'd she take it?
Really well.Surprisingly well.
She didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
All I'm asking for is a little emotion.Is that too much to ask after six years?
What,are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?I mean,did we not have as much fun?
Don't I deserve a few tears?
When we told Joey,he cried his eyes out.
I did not cry my eyes out!
Come on,it's like the end of an era.No more J-Man and Channy's!
Okay,I gotta ask,who calls us that?
You got married again?
Yes.
So that's your second marriage in two years?
Yes. Second in two years.Third,overall.
I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years...and never have I had so much business from one client.
Why don't you tell me what happened?
Basically,Rachel and I were in Vegas,and we got drunk.
I'm sorry,is this the same Rachel whose name you said...at the altar in the second marriage?
Yes,yes,yes.But I do not love her.
That's better then.
This was just a drunken mistake,and I need to get it annulled.I see.
Have you considered therapy?
I think just the annulment for today.
-There are some forms to fill out. -It's easy.
We'll need witnesses who can testify that you were not of sound mind.
It's no problem.
We'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
There's no way to do this without her?Because I kind of already told her it was taken care of
Of course you did.
Look,you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
What about someone who looks like Rachel?
I will think about the therapy.
So I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
Okay.
No point in dragging it out.
Dragging out the long process of you moving out...and us not living together anymore.
Okay
What about this? Who gets this?
I don't know if I want it because it might be too many memories.
-What is that? -I don't know.
How about this? I want you to have the big plate.
Wow,Monica,thanks. I love this plate.
Something to remember me by.
Mon,you're not dying. I'm just moving out.
We're gonna see each other all the time.
But still,it's a big change.The end of an era,you might say.
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
I'm fine. I was thinking about how it's an end of an era.
Oh,all right.
But I gotta say,I don't think six years counts as an era.
An era is defined as a significant period of time.
It was significant for me. Maybe it wasn't significant to you!
-What is the matter with you? -What is the matter with you?!
Why aren't you more upset?Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not living together?
Aren't you gonna miss me at all?
Monica,all right. But don't get mad at me.
It's just a little hard to believe.What's hard to believe?
I mean,it's you guys. You do this kind of stuff,you know?
You were gonna get married in Vegas,and then you backed out.
I'm not upset because I don't see you going through with it. I'm sorry.
It's going to happen.Chandler will move in here.
-But I.. -I know,just let me finish,okay?
This isn't something that we just impulsively decided to do in Vegas.This is something that we both really want.
And it is going to happen.It is?
Really?Yeah,sweetie.
You mean,we're not gonna live together anymore?
No
Oh,my God. I'm gonna miss you so much.I'm gonna miss you.
I mean,it's the end of an era!I know!
-Okay,bye. -Oh,no.
So did you get the annulment?-I couldn't.
-I knew it. Because you love Rachel.
It's not that. Annulments are more complicated..
It's complicated because of the love.
I do not love Rachel.
I'm telling her about the whole thing...so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible.
Would I do that if I loved her?
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
I do not have feelings for Rachel,okay?
Oh,what's wrong?
Monica and Chandler are moving in here...and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Oh,my God,come here,come here. It's okay.Everything's gonna be okay.
-Thank you. -Of course.
So Ross and Rachel got married.Monica and Chandler almost got married.
You think we should hook up?
Oh,we do.But not just yet.
Really? Well,when?
Well,first Chandler and Monica will get married...and be filthy rich,by the way.
But it won't work out.
Wow. I know.
Then I'll marry Chandler for the money.
And you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.Great.
But then we ditch them and we get married.
We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids.
Getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
What about Ross?I don't want to go into the whole thing.But
we have words and I kill him.
23, red and odd.
- No! - Yes! Motherfucker!
Fucking nailed it, T!
23. Sophia's birthday. I should have had that.
- Got it like five ways there.
- Six. He's on red too.
- You cocksucking motherfucker. - What happened?
- Tone hit one straight up. - Finally.
66-1 0 going out.
Don't spill those.
- Take it or play it? - Let us play it.
- All right. - All right, my man.
23 and all around.
- You kidding? - You gotta ride that.
- One more time. - Come on.
- Do it again! - Come on.
- 23. - Come on, come on.
Come on, bounce.
- Do it again! - Come on, 23.
1 1.
- Fucking Christ. - Jeez.
Douchebags are taking it all back tonight.
What the fuck, Vito? You almost hit me.
Timber, motherfucker.
Stop right there!
Ten to one odds. Poor Boy's Delight and she fucking comes in.
Oh!
Look at this mezza-mort.
Hey.
- Sil. - How are you, baby?
- Good to see you. - Hey.
Sit down.
Can I get you something? A coffee or a bun?
I'll let you two talk.
So?
I really appreciate you letting me see you.
And you've been so decent about everything since Vito's death.
I just don't know who else...
All right, all right. Come on, Marie.
- What can I do? - It's Little V.
The social worker says he's just acting out.
- Social worker? - Boy stuff mostly,
but he is so angry.
Although some of what he's being accused of is just persecution.
They claim that he hung the Petruzzos' cat on their garage door,
but it's totally unfounded.
Well, you know, in a way it's to be expected, with Vito passing and all that that entrailed.
I think the only solution is to move away
from that house and the kids at school.
I figured it out,
and I know it's a lot,
but for 1 00,000,
we could be someplace where no one knows him or what happened.
My friend Cheryl lives in Orono, Maine, by the university.
by the university.
And there's this two-storey cape,
with solid schools.
You always said if there's anything you could do...
Sure.
Have you talked to his uncle?
- Who? - Phil.
Phil's not his uncle. Him and I are second cousins.
Before we get too drastic here
and uproot little Vito  and all of you
from your friends and your family,
I should talk to him. He's impossible to talk to.
It's not easy to substitute for a dad.
I know.
But maybe I can fill in here.
OK, but you'll think about it?
Believe me, I'm gonna take care of you and he's gonna be OK.
Well,
apparently Vito Junior's a whack job.
No surprise there. Family history?
She wants 100K for a change of scenery.
That never works.
She should get him a dog.
I don't think that's a good idea.
The point is, how the fuck is this my problem?
Because I'm the boss of the family?
Where the fuck is Phil Leotardo?
He created the situation by clipping Vito to begin with.
My best fucking earner.
Now second time around I'm getting my pocket picked.
Not to mention he's his uncle
or cousin or whatever the fuck.
Not your problem. I agree.
I agree, Jim.
I argued against the on-side kick.
Let us face it, they rarely work.
The overworked Bucs D are falling apart
as the Bills,
with that play, are inside the 30 and loaded for goal.
- Let us go. Come on. - Just watch.
- Bills will get another seven. - You think?
- Nah, I say a quick field goal wins it. - Absolutely.
－They'll choke. That's what they do. You got Buffalo, right, T?
- Line is three. I'll settle for a push.
- Buffalo! Fucking go for it!
Third and two, the snap. Losman's back, he hands it off.
Fumble!
Ball's... Buffalo recovers.
- No! - Fumble again.
Get him! Come on!
Oh, no. Oh, boy. Get him!
Buffalo scores as time expires.
Un-fucking-believable.
Buffalo! Fucking A!
Listen to this fucking guy. Probably won $35 down there.
Final score, Buffalo 28,
Tampa Bay 24.
Skip, another beer?
No, I'm gonna go take a snooze.
Beautiful, sweetheart.
Nancy Sinatra, everybody.
- Congratulations, Philly. - Thank you.
We were gonna go the festival route
but we found a guy who wants to distribute it himself,
so we'll see.
It's a good little movie.
Jesus Christ, it's 11 :30.
- Ready to call it?
- An hour ago.
I saw him bring Dean and Jerry back together.
I was there at the telethon.
I cried.
- You leaving already?
- Yeah, it's late.
Got a long hike to Jersey from here.
Sure, I used to drive it myself.
No more, though.
I'll be right back.
Congratulations again.
Listen, I gotta bring this up.
- A favour already? - Excuse me?
Anthony, you always have business on your mind.
Take a night, smell the cognac.
Marie Spatafore came to see me.
She wants 100 grand to relocate
on account of Vito Junior already has his own social worker.
Patty told me there was doings.
The turd doesn't fall far from the faggot's ass.
That's beautifully put,
but you're family, right? Cousins?
What can you do? Throw money at the problem?
Well, somebody's gonna.
- I'll talk to the kid, set him right.
- Good.
You two going home together?
How the fuck are you?
Fucking prostate keep me pissing all night.
I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.
A drink?
I talked to Phil about the split on the MRl centres.
- Your cut is on the way.
- So is Christmas.
You should have heard him tonight.
- Comments, smug. - Really?
Worries me.
I thought we were getting along pretty good finally,
you know, considering.
Could be the hubris, making boss.
I think it's what went down with his brother Billy.
I thought all that got buried with your cousin.
You enjoy the dinner?
- I left right after. - Yeah?
I don't know.
I look at my key guys,
Paulie, Christopher, my brother-in-law,
what's number one on their agenda?
They're all fucking murderers, for Christ's sake.
Lonely at the top, boychik?
What I'm trying to say is...
it's nice being here.
Always is.
Oh.
I brought you something.
Cover up that dome.
Actually, I was expecting something else.
What, the fucking DVD?
It's a very unflattering portrait
of ltalian-Americans.
No, I was thinking maybe some of that 200,000 I loaned you?
Oh, Jesus. Yeah, that's right.
I know it's covered. It's just after a while...
You know, I lost track.
I'm glad you didn't.
- I don't wanna be a stickler. - No.
Anthony, come on. No, it's OK. It's OK.
I got about three grand here. Point and a half good?
- No, come on, fuck this. - You gotta have it.
- I don't want you eating cat food. - Stop it.
I don't gotta have it. I don't want a vig from you.
No, come on.
I should have been on it.
- You sure? - Jesus Christ, are we good or what?
Well, it's late.
I should be getting back.
You should get back to pissing, or whatever you...
I lend the guy money. Suddenly I'm the schmuck.
Why does he need your money?
Why? To cover his nut.
Between his gambling and the lifestyle
and that boat...
3.2 mil. I warned him.
It has absolutely no resale value whatsoever.
Does he listen?
I've lent lots of money.
Once the chiselling starts, "I forgot."
Who forgets? Fuck him.
This is why I don't like you seeing him before bed. You're all upset.
Makes a big show of giving me a vig.
3,000 a week.
You got a lot of Jews in your business, right?
- My business?
- Yeah, this.
You gotta hand it to them, when it comes to money...
In my experience,
that's nothing more than an ugly stereotype. Really?
I got a friend, you tie a Krugerrand to a fishing line, you're gonna land him.
Right up on the dock by him.
Doesn't sound like you think of him as a friend.
Come on. We go way back.
But that didn't stop him from busting my balls cos I owe him some money.
Anyway, I needed a little bridge loan
to cover some of my gambling losses.
- Still? - You know, good money after bad.
- Why not just stop? - Big part of my life.
You've been talking about it a lot.
Well, you lose sometimes.
You gotta act like it hurts a little more than it does,for your guys.
But if you're gonna lose, what's the fucking point?
So you need the risk.
What are you chasing?
Money or a high from winning?
Before we end,
there's something I need to bring up.
You miss a lot of appointments.
I always give you the required notice or I pay for the hour.
- That's not my point. - Well, I get busy.
It's my fault. I've condoned it for a long time.
I haven't had a panic attack since my uncle shot me.
- Did you notice that? - Yes.
Well, it must be nice to know everything.
Is that the only reason why you're here?
The panic attacks?
No.
This is
an...oasis in my week.
- So this is vacation?
-No, I benefit in many ways.
Decide if you wanna keep coming,
but you know there are protocols that you have to be followed
or I won't be able to continue.
OK, I will.
Now, I know Brian wants the media room downstairs,
but I think it's better if the gym has access to the pool.
That's the inspector.
I told the guy to run cable for computers
but I can't promise it's not already obsolete.
Hi. How are you? Ted Yacanelli,Yacanelli Home lnspections.
Come in. These are our cousins, Hugh and Carmela.
-They're also the builders.
- Great.
- Do you wanna start over here?
- Yeah.
I didn't come out here just to buy you a couple of sundaes.
- It's a Silo.
- I don't give a fuck what it is.
What the hell's wrong with you?
You look like a Puerto Rican whore. You make me sick.
So? What's it gotta do with you?
Listen, pally, you need to be rebellious.
I raised kids. I get it.
- Good for you. - You want a smack too?
You ever think what this is doing to your mother,
what she's been through, how you're upsetting her?
- She's just embarrassed.
- She cries for you.
I'm gonna say this cos you're old enough to understand.
Your family's had enough shame.
You should set things right.
- You understand me? - No.
Jesus Christ. Be a man.
Be the kind of man she needs, strong, masculine.
I said my piece.
Finish that thing. There's no eating in the car.
I'd like to take a minute for everybody to enjoy the fact
that your mother has sold her house.
- Oh, my God, that's fantastic. - Congratulations, Mom.
- That's so good. - It just passed inspection.
- Brian needs to get loan approval...
- All right, enough.
Congratulations, Carm. It's not an easy thing to do these days.
I had a lot of support.
- Brian and Janine must be so happy. - I hope so.
- Just the two? It's big, right?
- It's a mansion.
Pass me the salad.
They have a baby on the way.
- Hello? - Have you looked outside?
Oh, Jesus, Mellie.
We replaced 60...50% of the bad lumber with Doug fir.
What about the studs?
And those headers upstairs? I'm nauseous.
For the hundredth time,
I've done a ton of houses using the same construction before these sob sisters took over the building department
and I'm not losing any sleep.
Lunch.
- Mortadella and provolone. -That's Chrissy.
The mysterious stranger.
- Hey. - Long time.
Sit. I had to drop Eli off at physical therapy.
I thought I'd check in on the brain trust.
- Play a hand. - Yeah, don't be shy, Shylock.
- I got a little time. Why not?
- "Why not?" he says.
Did you hear the one about the Jewish terrorist?
He was gonna hijack a plane but he didn't wanna use his miles.
- You want a sandwich? - I just ate, thanks.
He's not here to eat.
He's here for the rent. The rent, the rent.
What are you talking about?
You know what? I'll have a beer.
- Here you go. – Will you stop already?
That should get me through another week.
I got some spare change here too.
It's a joke.
Where's your sense of humour?
Put this in the pot, make things interesting.
I'll take a shot at that.
- Let us play. - Let us see it.
Are you sure you did it right?
Yes, and it's normal. Maybe it was the Kung Pao.
- Get me a drink. - Sure, alcohol, that's good for it.
Get one yourself.
It's not the fucking MSG. It's Tony Soprano.
You know, he really helped me when I was in the hospital.
- Never lend friends money, Eli. - He still won't pay?
That's the least of it.
He's all worked up or something.
I don't like the way he talks. Hostile remarks.
It's not like him. Makes me worry.
Yeah, I can see that. What are you thinking?
Come on.
Tony's not gonna hurt you.
You've seen how these ltalians work.
For the most part, it's OK.
Get them cornered, you're dealing with nothing more than an animal.
- You think he's gonna kill you now?
- I don't fucking know.
He's the guy I call to deal with people like him.
- He's a rich man. He'll pay.
- His minus assets?
I'd say under six.
- He's a boss. - I've known him a long time.
Money goes in one hand and out the other.
The more he makes, the more he spends.
His wife?
At what point is it cheaper for him to settle it another way?
Yeah, right. Time to go.
- Hello, Mr Chips. - Yeah, we're up about...
18.
I could go for a rib-eye.
No kidding. What, because I'm up?
- Holy shit. - What?
Batavia in the fifth. Two to one.
Meadow Gold in the fifth.
- We gotta do that.
- Three minutes to post.
- Glenlivet rocks. - Seven and seven.
What do you have on tap?
Give him a beer, anything.
Fuck it, I don't wanna miss this.
Batavia, here we go. - Where's the goddamn sound? The boss put 1 8-plus on this.
- Maybe 25. - Yeah?
What the fuck's your problem?
Nothing. I'm excited. What do you want?
They're running.
Where's the fucking sound?
It's on, Tone.
- Go, girl! - Go, you fucking nag. There you go.
- Come on, baby. - She's in the lead!
- She's in the lead, come on. - Come on, go, girl!
Go, go, go! That a girl! Go, go, go!
Rounding the turn, Swelligant, Meadow Gold, Mestizo.
Kir Royale and Smoosh Baby falling back.
It's Swelligant and Meadow Gold.
- Come on! - Kir Royale on the outside.
- Swelligant and Meadow Gold. - Fucking go!
And it's Swelligant by a nose.
- By a cunt hair, T ony. - Heartbreaker.
What are you gonna do?
Madam, your dessert.
- I didn't order nothing. - I ordered for you.
You know I'm trying to watch my weight.
What is this?
Oh, my God. Anthony.
- You like it? - It's gorgeous.
- I don't know what to say.
- Look,I know you're scared, OK?
All the problems you had with Hector's dad... I'm not like that.
I know. It's not just that.
Well, what, then? I'm gonna work my ass off.
You know I'll always take care of you guys.
In three months I made night manager of the pizzeria.
In another three I'll be in charge of the day shifts.
A couple of years, I'll own a chain of restaurants, clubs.
You'll never have to work again.
- Look, I love you. - I love you too.
So marry me, then. And we'll have kids.
You always say you want Hector to have brothers and sisters.
OK.
Can I get you some coffee?
No, I think it's time for our talk here.
- So what happened at school today?
- I get blamed for everything.
The girl was developmentally disabled.
Uncle Phil said he talked to you.
Is he just wasting his breath?
Is that what you're telling us?
This trouble you're causing,
I'm disappointed cos you always were a good kid.
- You don't even know me. - What is that supposed to mean?
Sometimes you call me Carlo Jr.
I couldn't shut your dad up about what a good kid you were.
- We were friends, you know. - Butt buddies?
You're being funny.
That's good.
Cos I'm sure you miss him a lot,
whatever he was.
And now I wanna say some things.
- You're gonna look at me. - I'm not moving to fucking Maine!
You think anybody wants that? You know how much that's gonna cost your mother?
- Whatever. - Listen to me, OK?
I'm not some fucking social worker.
You knock this weird shit off
or I'll introduce you to a plate-glass window.
Somebody should have told my dad to knock off the weird shit.
You go about in pity for yourself.
What about what your mother's been through?
What am I supposed to do about it?
Your dad's gone. You're the man of the house.
Start fucking acting like it.
You get me?
Well, I just got back from the closing.
Come here!
We should pop the champagne or go out or something.
Maybe. I don't know.
- Why not? - You know why not, Tony.
- It's upsetting, this whole thing. - Jesus, the lumber again?
Carm, your cousin Brian has fucked over a lot of people.
Trust me.
So how much in the end? All in?
Well, after construction,
the purchase of the land, closing costs,
it must be close to six.
Yeah.
You know what you should do?
Take a chunk of that and put it on the Jets.
Yes, very funny.
- I'm serious. We can't get hurt. - It's "we" now?
It's a sure thing. Celia, she works at the Bing,
she's got a sister lives in San Diego,
she's an osteopath, and she says that the Chargers' QB
has a hairline fracture in his right leg.
And even Vegas doesn't know about it.
I didn't say all of it.
You know, just a piece of my half.
You're rich, Tony. Use some of those bundles to cover it.
That money's for emergencies only, Carm.
My other money's tied up in asset allocation.
- What is that?
- Listen to me, OK? This is the gravy.
Windfall cash.
This is the kind of shit you play with.
I'm telling you, we are golden here.
Listen.
Forget it.
I shouldn't have mentioned it.
I mean it.
It's all right, it's just I thought this was my money.
You're right. You're right.
It’s yours.
Renata?
What?
- Go to the bedroom and lock the door. - What's going on?
Do as I ask.
- What are you doing here?
- Nice to see you too.
I was watching CNN. Fucking Hezbollah.
We're running down to the boat show in Edison.
- Thought you might want to join. - I'd love to.
- But Renata's got a migraine.
- That's too bad.
The vig. Three grands. Should put us up to date.
I can't take this. Give it all to me whenever you can.
- You're gonna do this every time? - Whatever you say.
- Sit down. Have a drink.
- We should get going, probably.
OK. But next time.
For sure?
Yeah, next time I'll call first.
Did you see that pissy attitude?
Come all the way out here to pick him up,
not to mention give him his fucking vig in person.
You believe this fucking guy?
Should tell him to go fuck himself for his 200K.
What's he gonna do about it?
To not pay my debts? Head of the family?
- How's that gonna look?
- Who's gonna know?
- It's like Eddie Valentine.
- That guy from Philly?
With the polio leg and the built-up shoe?
No, from the Twilight Zone.
You must have seen that one.
You should start sucking cock instead of watching TV Land
cos Vito brought in three times what you do on construction.
Yeah.
And I didn't have this fucking problem.
God fucking damn it!
What?
That's good, right?
No. I only bet ten.
- But you won. - What did I say?
What did I tell you? It's a sure thing.
You talk about this crap like it's science.
I lost a lot of fucking money.
You didn't lose.
We could have turned your bullshit into a million dollars.
My "bullshit"?
That spec house was my investment.
- For my future! - Here we go.
Ginny Sack had to move in with her daughter.
Again with Ginny Sack.
John provided. She's a fucking hysteric.
Did you ever think I might know what I'm doing?
You and the furniture and the cars.
You would have spent everything I made if I let you.
The next time you win I'll take a cut,
and I'll roll the fucking dice.
You already took your cut, from the bird feeder.
And don't fucking deny it again.
What? 40 grand in the stock market?
I'd ask for my piece, but there's nothing.
That spec house? I made the down payment.
I bought the materials.
I leaned on that building inspector when you had your thumb up your ass.
So stop talking about your money!
Let go of me, you piece of shit!
You're a shitty businesswoman who built a piece-of-shit house
that's gonna cave in and kill that fucking unborn baby any day.
And now you can't sleep.
Go fuck yourself!
When I'm gone you can live in a dumpster for all I care.
I was so... I told you, dude.
At three-point range the ball wouldn't hit the rim.
- That was the worst pass.
- Get lost.
Nobody drop the soap. Spaz-a-fuckwit's in the house.
You can see his pussy.
What the fuck you looking at, fag?
- What the fuck? - He shit.
- Oh, God!
- Jesus, what's wrong with you?
- He stepped in it!
- Gross!
- He shit in the fucking shower!
- Are you crazy?
Cocksucker's Corvair Monza is still in his garage,
so we boost the piece of shit.
We're heading down Communipaw Avenue
and the fucking thing starts...
You get word on the power tools?
What? Yeah. Spics in Florida sending the first truck Friday.
- How about the hardware store? - Ready for the whole load.
- Speaking of loads, hear about Vito Junior?
What?
Marie called. He got expelled cos he took a shit in the shower in gym class.
- That sick little fuck.
- You should see him.
The make-up.
And without school, Marie says he's shut in his room all day.
Probably thinking about how to pull a Columbine.
But the little girl...
Francesca.
Her dad's gone, her brother's a psycho,
her mother's a basket case. She's nine years old.
What the fuck did she ever do?
Tragedy.
Like a pebble in a lake. Even the fish feel it.
It's not right.
Vito was one of us.
So he sucked a cock. Prior to that, he was our friend.
Can't just cut his family loose.
That piece of shit, Phil, he's never gonna pony up.
I tell you what, I will never forget that he didn't come through here.
- Never. - Let it go, Tone.
This is good of you, Tone, helping Marie.
I'll always remember it.
Let us go. I gotta swing by Slava's,
liquefy some offshore monies.
Yeah, dude.
Yeah.
Hey, Jesus, you got outta work early.
I need to talk to you.
What's the matter?
- What's this? - Your clothes.
- I just did laundry a couple days ago.
- It's not laundry.
- Mami! - No, Papi, stay.
- What about the parade?
- I'm going with my brother.
- What?
- I need to give this back to you.
- I can't keep it.
- Why? I mean, I love you.
I love you, too, Anthony.
Look, I don't know. Maybe I don't.
All's I know is I just don't feel it.
You hear about this thing with the Dolphins' kicker?
He went under a whole truck.
Yeah, fucking motorcycles.
Helmet saved his life.
- He out for Sunday? - Maybe the whole season.
And the backup kicker? He's right out of college.
- Against Philly. - Too good to be true.
I'm gonna put the whole 100K down on Philadelphia.
And if I win, Marie Spatafore gets a free ride and then some.
Yeah, good for you.
Cos Carlo said the kid went into the litter box and ate some cat shit.
No, he took a shit, in the shower.
Glad we got that straight.
Hell of a finish.
Injuries, even tragedy, they are unable to stop Miami.
Final score, Miami 21, Philadelphia 7.
When you get support like that,
it makes all the difference.
Hey, Marie. How you holding up?
- He snuck out again last night.
- Like I told you, I want to help you.
God bless you, Tony. I don't know what else to do.
Well, I do.
There's this camp in ldaho and they handle kids like him.
Idaho?
You know, like tough love? You know?
Saw it on TV,
and honestly, I was moved to tears by some of the success stories.
- It's a camp? - A school camp.
Tony.
They allow corporal punishment.
His guidance counsellor told me about those places,
and they're in Utah and ldaho
because state law allows them to strike the kids.
That's just for the deterrent factor.
It's 18 grand but I'm gonna take care of it for you,
so don't worry.
There's no geographical solution to an emotional problem, Marie.
Maine, wherever.
- Marie?
- Yeah?
I know it's hard,
but it's the best thing for him.
- OK?
- Thank you, Tony.
Hey, Tone, isn't that...
What's their names? Used to hang out at the Bing.
- Wake up, Vito. - What?
Vito, my name is Steve. I'm here to help you.
You're gonna come with us now, all right?
- Come on. - What?
Come on.
No, let me go!
- Come on. Hey! - It's all right.
- Let me go! Mom, no! - It's gonna be OK.
I'm so sorry, honey.
- Stop. Let me go!
- It'll be OK.
You have to be strong. You're doing the right thing.
- Who are you? - Franny, go back to bed.
Mrs Spatafore, he's gonna be fine.
- Mom! - I'm sorry, honey.
No! No.
Oh, God.
This one coming down to the buzzer.
Stackhouse draining a three-pointer as time ran out,
Ieading Dallas to a 109 to 108 victory over the visiting San Antonio Spurs.
So what? We're not speaking now?
Listen to me, come here.
What?
Sit down.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
I really am.
You did real good with that house.
And I should know. I'm in construction.
I'm glad to hear you approve.
I have been losing.
I'm fucking losing right now.
A real shitty streak.
So your solution is to risk more and make things even worse?
You start chasing it.
And every time you get your hands around it
you fall further backwards
So this is about money? Cos it didn't feel like it.
Carm, I swear to you, you're not gonna be like Ginny.
I've been real good about that
and it's not gonna happen to us.
I hate that you're going around acting all the time like it will.
I worry, Tony. I do.
You already got shot.
Now you won't go down and get the paper. Who is out there?
- Come on... - What is it?
What are the million other possibilities?
The FBl waiting to take you away?
You eat and you play,
and you pretend there's not a giant piano hanging by a rope over the top of your head every minute of every day.
That's it. I've been thinking about this.
Now, I survived a fucking gunshot wound.
- What are the odds on that?
- Terrible.
So if you think about it,
I'm up.
- What?
- Way up.
That was me, not a fireboat.
10:30.
10:30. What would you like for breakfast?
Renata?
Renata?
Oh, God, no.
Wait. Wait. Renata.
Renata.
Renata
 - 911. What is the emergency?
- She was a great girl.
- Thanks.
The best.
I…
I brought your money.
Sorry for your loss.
